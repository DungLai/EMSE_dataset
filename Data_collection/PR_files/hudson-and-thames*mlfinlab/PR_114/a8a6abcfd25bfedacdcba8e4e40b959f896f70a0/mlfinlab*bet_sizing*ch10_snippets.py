"""
This module contains the code snippets found in Chapter 10 of
"Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado.
The code has been ammended for readability, to conform to PEP8
rules, to keep the snippets as manageable single-units of
functionality, as well as to account for depracation of functions
originally used, but is otherwise unaltered.
