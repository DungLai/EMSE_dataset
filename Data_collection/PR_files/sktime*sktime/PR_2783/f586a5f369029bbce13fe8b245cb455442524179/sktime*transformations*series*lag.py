Extension template for transformers.

Purpose of this implementation template:
    quick implementation of new estimators following the template
    NOT a concrete class to import! This is NOT a base class or concrete class!
    This is to be used as a "fill-in" coding template.

How to use this implementation template to implement a new estimator:
- make a copy of the template in a suitable location, give it a descriptive name.
- work through all the "todo" comments below
- fill in code for mandatory methods, and optionally for optional methods
- you can add more private methods, but do not override BaseEstimator's private methods
    an easy way to be safe is to prefix your methods with "_custom"
- change docstrings for functions and the file
- ensure interface compatibility by sktime.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator
- once complete: use as a local library, or contribute to sktime via PR
- more details: https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/developer_guide/add_estimators.html

Mandatory implements:
    fitting         - _fit(self, X, y=None)
    transformation  - _transform(self, X, y=None)

Optional implements:
    inverse transformation      - _inverse_transform(self, X, y=None)
    update                      - _update(self, X, y=None)
    fitted parameter inspection - get_fitted_params()

Testing - implement if sktime transformer (not needed locally):
    get default parameters for test instance(s) - get_test_params()

class Lag(BaseTransformer):
    """Lagging transformer. Lags time series by one or multiple lags.

    Transforms a time series into a lagged version of itself.
    Multiple lags can be provided, as a list. Estimator-like wrapper of pandas.shift.

    Lags can be provided as a simple offset, `lags`, or pair of (lag count, frequency),
    with lag count an int (`lags` arg) and frequency a `pandas` frequency descriptor.

    When multiple lags are provided, multiple column concatenated copies of the lagged
    time series will be created.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lags : lag offset, or list of lag offsets, optional, default=0 (identity transform)
        a "lag offset" can be one of the following:
        int - number of periods to shift/lag
        time-like: DateOffset, tseries.offsets, or timedelta
            time delta offset to shift/lag
            requires time index of transformed data to be time-like (not int)
        str - time rule from pandas.tseries module, e.g., "EOM"
    freq : frequency descriptor of list of frequency descriptors, optional, default=None
        if passed, must be equal length to "lags" argument
        elements in freq correspond to elements in lags
        if i-th element of freq is not None, i-th element of lags must be int
            this is called the "corrdsponding lags element" below
        "frequency descriptor" can be one of the following:
        time-like: DateOffset, tseries.offsets, or timedelta
            multiplied to corresponding "lags" element when shifting
        str - offset from pd.tseries module, e.g., "D", "M", or time rule, e.g., "EOM"
    ind_align : str, optional, one of "shift", "realign", "extend", default="extend"
        determines set of output indices in lagged time series
        "shift" - only shifted indices are retained.
            Will not create NA for single lag, but can create NA for multiple lags.
        "realign" - only original indices are retained. Will usually create NA.
        "extend" - both original indices and shifted indices are retained.
            Will usually create NA, possibly many, if shifted/original do not intersect.
    NA_behaviour : str, optional, one of "NA", "fill_value", "bfill", "nearest"
        determines handling of NA that are possibly created, after they are created.
