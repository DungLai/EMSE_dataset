"""KNN time series classification.

 Built on sklearn KNeighborsClassifier, this class supports a range of distance
 measure specifically for time series. These distance functions are defined in cython
 in sktime.distances.elastic_cython. Python versions are in sktime.distances.elastic
 but these are orders of magnitude slower.

Please note that many aspects of this class are taken from scikit-learn's
KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier class with necessary changes to enable use with time
series classification data and distance measures.

todo: add a utility method to set keyword args for distance measure parameters.
(e.g.  handle the parameter name(s) that are passed as metric_params automatically,
depending on what distance measure is used in the classifier (e.g. know that it is w
for dtw, c for msm, etc.). Also allow long-format specification for
non-standard/user-defined measures e.g. set_distance_params(measure_type=None,
param_values_to_set=None,
param_names=None)

class KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier(BaseClassifier):
    """KNN Time Series Classifier.

    An adapted version of the scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier to work with
    time series data.

    Necessary changes required for time series data:
        -   calls to X.shape in kneighbors, predict and predict_proba.
            In the base class, these methods contain:
                n_samples, _ = X.shape
            This however assumes that data must be 2d (a set of multivariate
            time series is 3d). Therefore these methods
            needed to be overridden to change this call to the following to
            support 3d data:
                n_samples = X.shape[0]
        -   check array has been disabled. This method allows nd data via an
        argument in the method header. However, there
            seems to be no way to set this in the classifier and allow it to
            propagate down to the method. Therefore, this
            method has been temporarily disabled (and then re-enabled). It
            is unclear how to fix this issue without either
            writing a new classifier from scratch or changing the
            scikit-learn implementation. TO-DO: find permanent
            resolution to this issue (raise as an issue on sklearn GitHub?)


    Parameters

        if str, one of {'dtw','ddtw', 'wdtw','lcss','erp','msm','twe'}: default ='dtw'
            this will substitute a hard-coded distance metric from sktime.distances
        if callable, must be of signature (X: Panel, X2: Panel) -> np.ndarray
            output must be mxn array if X is Panel of m Series, X2 of n Series
