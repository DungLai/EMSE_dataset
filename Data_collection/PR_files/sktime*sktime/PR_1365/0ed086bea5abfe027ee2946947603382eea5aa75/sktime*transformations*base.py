"""
Base class template for transformers.

    class name: BaseTransformer

Covers all types of transformers.
Type and behaviour of transformer is determined by the following tags:
    "scitype:transform-output" tag with values "Primivites", or "Series"
        this determines type of output of transform
        if "Primitives", output is pd.DataFrame with as many rows as X has instances
            i-th instance of X is transformed into i-th row of output
        if "Series", output is a Series or Panel, with as many instances as X
            i-th instance of X is transformed into i-th instance of output
        Series are treated as one-instance-Panels
            if Series is input, output is a 1-row pd.DataFrame or a Series
    "scitype:instancewise" tag which is boolean
        if True, fit/transform is statistically independent by instance

Scitype defining methods:
    fitting         - fit(self, X, y=None)
    transform       - transform(self, X, y=None)
    fit&transform   - fit_transform(self, X, y=None)
    updating        - update(self, X, y=None)

Inspection methods:
    hyper-parameter inspection  - get_params()
    fitted parameter inspection - get_fitted_params()

State:
    fitted model/strategy   - by convention, any attributes ending in "_"
    fitted state flag       - is_fitted (property)
    fitted state inspection - check_is_fitted()
