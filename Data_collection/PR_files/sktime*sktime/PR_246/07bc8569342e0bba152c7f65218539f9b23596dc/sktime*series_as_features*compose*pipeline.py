class Pipeline(_Pipeline, BaseEstimator, MetaEstimatorMixin):
    """Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.

    Sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator.
    Intermediate steps of the pipeline must be 'transforms', that is,
    they must implement fit and transform methods.
    The final estimator only needs to implement fit.
    The transformers in the pipeline can be cached using ``memory`` argument.
    The purpose of the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be
    cross-validated together while setting different parameters.
    For this, it enables setting parameters of the various steps using their
    names and the parameter name separated by a '__', as in the example below.
    A step's estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter
    with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting
    to None.

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : list
        List of (name, transform) tuples (implementing fit/transform) that are
        chained, in the order in which they are chained, with the last object
        an estimator.
    memory : None, str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, optional
        Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. By default,
        no caching is performed. If a string is given, it is the path to
        the caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of
        the transformers before fitting. Therefore, the transformer
        instance given to the pipeline cannot be inspected
        directly. Use the attribute ``named_steps`` or ``steps`` to
        inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the
        transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming.
    random_state: : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        Passed random state is propagated to all steps of the pipeline that
        have a random state attribute.
        - If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        - If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        - If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
    check_input: boolean, optional (default=True)
        When set to ``True``, inputs will be validated, otherwise inputs are
        assumed to be valid
        and no checks are performed in any step of the pipeline. Use with
        caution.


    Attributes
    ----------
    named_steps : bunch object, a dictionary with attribute access
        Read-only attribute to access any step parameter by user given name.
        Keys are step names and values are steps parameters.
