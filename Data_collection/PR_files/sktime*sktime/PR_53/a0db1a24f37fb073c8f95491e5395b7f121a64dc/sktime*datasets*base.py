    Parameters
    ----------
    split: str{"ALL", "TRAIN", "TEST"}, optional (default="TRAIN")
        Whether to load the train or test partition of the problem. By default it loads the train split.

    Returns
    -------
    X: pandas DataFrame with m rows and c columns
        The time series data for the problem with m cases and c dimensions
    y: numpy array
        The class labels for each case in X

    This dataset involves one female actor and one male actor making a motion with their
    hand. The two classes are: Gun-Draw and Point: For Gun-Draw the actors have their
    hands by their sides. They draw a replicate gun from a hip-mounted holster, point it
    at a target for approximately one second, then return the gun to the holster, and
    their hands to their sides. For Point the actors have their gun by their sides.
    They point with their index fingers to a target for approximately one second, and
    then return their hands to their sides. For both classes, we tracked the centroid
    of the actor's right hands in both X- and Y-axes, which appear to be highly
    correlated. The data in the archive is just the X-axis.

    The arrowhead data consists of outlines of the images of arrowheads. The shapes of the
    projectile points are converted into a time series using the angle-based method. The
    classification of projectile points is an important topic in anthropology. The classes
    are based on shape distinctions such as the presence and location of a notch in the
    arrow. The problem in the repository is a length normalised version of that used in
    Ye09shapelets. The three classes are called "Avonlea", "Clovis" and "Mix"."
