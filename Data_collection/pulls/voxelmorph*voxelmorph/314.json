Thanks for the review!\r\n\r\nWhile we're here, there are use-cases that weigh one modality more than others (e.g., T1 NCC weighed higher than FA NCC is common in DWI analysis). This is straightforward to add with an optional `weights` arg, but there may be some concerns with mild feature creep. Let me know if I should add it.
