It will apply compress level 2 in that case.\r\n\r\nLossy formats can be verified by uploading jpg through diffgram and download from cloud storage and compare the hash.\r\nPNG format can be verified by uploading any PNG with compress_level=2..9 and download from cloud storage and compare the hash. For level 0 and 1 you can upload and see the file size decrease (although the difference between level 1 and 2 is small sometimes).\r\n\r\nAs for the reason I didn't go for the idea of using the filesize is because there isn't a reliable way to determine the alpha channel after it is removed.\r\n\r\nThe check for compression level takes about 0.7 seconds per 10.000 PNG files (reading the byte and assigning the Boolean). \r\n\r\nAltering this to use default compression is possible as well. I leave that design choice to you.\r\n\r\nJust need to check for Superfast and Fast compression\r\n```\r\ncompress = ( f.read(1) in [b'\\x01', b'^'] )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd change the compress_level to 6\r\n```\r\nimwrite(new_temp_filename, np.asarray(self.raw_numpy_image), compress_level=6)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBulk uploads of 10K images could take up to an hour to process if the compression needs to be applied to all of them in case level 6 gets chosen. The space saved for images at level 5 could be 470mB, and for to level 2 and 6 could be 4.340mB.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-16T02:14:50Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T13:53:02Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T13:53:02Z","merged_at":"2022-02-18T13:53:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a95fb398d7bebab77ba0019da686db868475da2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/606/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/606/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/606/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/statuses/d09a0faa4f9d2c341f8c12afca2ef4105dbb3eca","head":{"label":"MathijsNL:imwrite_format","ref":"imwrite_format","sha":"d09a0faa4f9d2c341f8c12afca2ef4105dbb3eca","user":{"login":"MathijsNL","id":1612886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1612886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL","html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":457166526,"node_id":"R_kgDOGz_Ovg","name":"diffgram","full_name":"MathijsNL/diffgram","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MathijsNL","id":1612886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1612886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL","html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL/diffgram","description":"Complete
