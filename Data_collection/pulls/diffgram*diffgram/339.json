In terms of new functions, the \"Annotate\" button now\r\n1. Crosscuts jobs. Gets next across project. Means the Annotator does not need to know which job they are working on. Also a starting point to build more around QA centric tasks UI.\r\n2. Uses SkipLock to strengthen guarantees. Concept that we may build this into the \"on complete\" / get next during normal annotation. So if the tasks happen to be small, and there are many annotators, there's a collision chance.\r\n3. https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/commit/9e8e49df5c85e2533ae57b4c76108c7151cf9e8c#diff-e0558f300c30e0d7e278609a6fa9363326ff3dc3871d962f7ceb28cc4f7e809eR316\r\nChecks job ids are either in jobs assigned to user or open to all. \r\n\r\nThe nuance here is that it's project wide, but if the job is assigned to me, or is set to to invite only, then it's not eligible.\r\n\r\nTangent:\r\nNote that for status, we are checking that the status == `available`. The assumption here is the status is the more key thing then the user assigned. We could also check there is no user assigned, but then if an admin wants to assign it to someone else, we would have to expressly clear that or something.\r\n\r\n1.
