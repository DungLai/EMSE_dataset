This splits the old and confusing thing hidden in the `update` calls into much more clear stuff ->\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/148002852-a4a4be2e-3f45-4db2-8a79-e7d383f388b6.png)\r\n\r\nThe main concept here is to make it easier to understand when keyframes are getting added or removed from the cache\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/148002862-17165811-23de-41e1-a548-2e01966c0788.png)\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/commit/83b635759511c9ab3d1541b65f3175db88093d5b  (plus some little updates after)\r\n\r\n**Timing bug**\r\nThere was a timing bug here too - depending on the order of it it was possible that the deletion would overwrite the addition.\r\neg ->  added instance adds frame number 29 then the removed version of it goes and deletes it. it's correct if the order is inverted. but order is hard to setup here. \r\n\r\nSolution was to just tracking which sequences we already added to, and then using that as an ignore list.\r\n\r\nI think overall this will still need more iterations over time, but at least now it's pulled closer to the decision point and should be a lot more workable.\r\n\r\n**little fixes and performance boost**\r\nAlso fixed a variety of little cases with the inserts, eg before repeated calls could have resulted in more deletions etc.\r\nAND performance boost, was able to get rid of the `in list` check by adding a bisect plus some conditions. hat should mean that for large keyframe lists it's binary search time instead of checking each element.\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/61e34c951209e97ac10537f101d279616a2173cb/shared/database/video/sequence.py#L491  \r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Frontend**: \r\n  a) Better conditions on when to add keyframes on front end. bug fix that sometimes it was adding all.\r\n  b) Added a proactive removal method\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/commit/73f958ef1991b68e72b9d8636c7c8fea2758a33\r\n![adding 55s to all](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/148002744-410e7def-782c-4a71-8425-44e4fe4ba3a6.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe benefit of leaning on backend here is that it helps ensure alignment, but the downside is that it's a little clunky. \r\n\r\nI think it would be better to do this before save.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like it would break the pattern too much do that change now but something to keep in mind for v2 of the sequence browser. Really trying to move away from this dependency on the backend for stuff we already know on frontend. Rather have backend act more like a saving mechanism in this case then a blocker\r\n\r\n## Related bug observation - question for Pablo \r\nThe only state I was able to get into that would break this on backend was when the frontend failed to send instance list. eg by moving quickly in UI - some edge case of mashing buttons we haven't covered yet.\r\n\r\n![not having all the instances available can still cause keyframe issues](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/148003692-030ae512-6e40-4773-af95-6479b6c15466.png)\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting we go back to hard block on this for now, since it also breaks the keyframe thing other stuff.\r\nhttps://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/blob/61e34c951209e97ac10537f101d279616a2173cb/shared/annotation.py#L440\r\n\r\nHappy to revert quickly if we get too many hits on it, but perhaps when we do we can try to button up the front end, maybe block moving around in certain saving, or just make it more robust to allow navigation while saving (I think we took some steps there but maybe not 100% yet?)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know thoughts on this especially\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relying on the added/deleted and action_type\r\nThis stuff is starting to depend more on some of those flags and states. We may need some more iterations on that too.\r\n\r\n### Other items and side notes\r\n1. Identified regen as totally different case which is regen all from a fresh instance_list() pull. updated new function for that case ->
