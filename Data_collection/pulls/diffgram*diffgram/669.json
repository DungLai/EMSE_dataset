It might be a good idea to create a new issue then for the remaining files and the fixes for str() conversions within fstrings.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Converted files\r\nMost of the code files, test files and the installer.\r\nMost fstrings have double quotes except for the few that use double quotes inside.\r\n\r\n# Partially conversion\r\nSome fstrings have a str() variable inside after conversion. Example:\r\n```\r\nkind = f\"api_enable_{str(input['api_name'])}\",\r\n```\r\nIt probably won't hurt, and it can most likely be removed. Saving for next iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Not converted\r\nAll instances of @routes.route(). Updating them didn't really improve readability. These files should probably stay as they are, unless someone can think of a way to make these more readable.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Old\r\n@routes.route('/api/v1/project/<string:project_string_id>' +\r\n              '/userscript/list',\r\n              methods=['POST'])\r\n# New\r\n@routes.route(f\"/api/v1/project/<string:project_string_id>/userscript/list\",\r\n              methods=['POST'])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther files:\r\n\r\n- default\\methods\\source_control\\file\\file_browser.py\r\n- local_dispatcher\\env_adapter.py\r\n- shared\\settings\\env_adapter.py\r\n- shared\\helpers\\performance.py\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nNo straightforward conversion\r\n\r\n\r\n@PJEstrada I don't have time to build my docker containers and test right now so I am just creating the pull request.\r\nI separated the commits to the code and test files so you could more easily run your tests without modifications if that would be needed.\r\n\r\nAlso do you agree on double quoted fstrings by default?\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-24T00:45:01Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T14:35:58Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T14:35:58Z","merged_at":"2022-02-28T14:35:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"1723fdca9243e7b6a82332a23b9609608f417d64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/issues/669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diffgram/diffgram/statuses/20270c19428161c5f6d99b02890f59848ac2b2a4","head":{"label":"MathijsNL:fstring_conversion","ref":"fstring_conversion","sha":"20270c19428161c5f6d99b02890f59848ac2b2a4","user":{"login":"MathijsNL","id":1612886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1612886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL","html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":457166526,"node_id":"R_kgDOGz_Ovg","name":"diffgram","full_name":"MathijsNL/diffgram","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MathijsNL","id":1612886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1612886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL","html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MathijsNL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MathijsNL/diffgram","description":"Complete
