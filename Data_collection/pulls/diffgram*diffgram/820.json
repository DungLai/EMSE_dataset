dedicated change project button for rare contexts](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/commit/abc75715b9ac800c23bfd29c9b1aa06cb0432668) \r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the context that we normally set the project when the user logins in, in the rare event that there is no project:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18080164/163900100-779068a1-f08b-45d3-b781-b6cf57368393.png)\r\n\r\n1) The part that was confusing was that change project was within the project menu.\r\nThis meant that various conditions that made sense for most of the menu did not make sense for change project.\r\n\r\n2) Now there is a dedicated change project, that will only show up when there is no active project, the user's email is verified, and there is a project available\r\n3) Now the project and task menus only shows when there's an active project.\r\nWhile there's some UI trade offs for now that seems simpler then the disabled\r\n\r\nwhile we could \"get smart\" about some of the other resume onboarding, change, new project etc. there are so many contextual things for now feels better to keep that screen open - again keeping in mind it's a fallback that users should rarely get to\r\n\r\nthis iteration should close #817
