(MSVC 2019 dropped support for TR1.)\r\n* Specify `std::ios::binary` when opening the `*.params` file (DL model only). This is because Windows makes distinction between \"text files\" and \"binary files.\" (Unix does not make this distinction.) Opening the `params` file as text results in an undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nTODO: #104
