However DLR uses filenames to select from different constructors. Invoking LoadParams() after DLR constructor means DLR constructor is no longer stateless, which is undesirable. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to supply DLR C-API constructor with additional paths that contains the .json and .param file, by making CreateDLRModel() a variadic function. It allows all folders containing part of the model to be supplied in any order, in the following fashion:\r\n\r\n`CreateDLRModel(&model_handle, path1, device_type, device_id, num_addl_paths, path2, path3)`\r\n\r\nA macro in dlr.h handles the default value for additional arguments to maintain backward compatibility.
