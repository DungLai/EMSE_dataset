This speeds up (for example) the time between running `label-maker images` and it printing \"Downloading 10874 tiles to ...\". With this branch there is nearly no delay between starting label-maker and seeing that printout. With the npz setup it takes \"a while\" with the below `zurich.json` (a while == minutes or longer, I can measure it later).\r\n\r\n(This branch needs cleaning up a bit before merging, but wanted to
