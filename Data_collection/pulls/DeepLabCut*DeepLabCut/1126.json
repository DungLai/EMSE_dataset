few dependencies are drop as they were dep of dep; note moviepy is also dropped, but this might be required (seems not required to run `testscipt.py` and `testscript_multianimal.py` which pass successfully). \r\n\r\n- note, this also includes updating the conda files to TF 1.15.5 vs. 1.13.1; then numpy 1.17.3 is supported/no warnings.\r\n- this has only been tested on MacOS; I would ask @AlexEMG to test on ubuntu and @jeylau on windows before committing. \r\n- also only tested on CPU MacOS; GPU support should be tested w/TF 1.15.5\r\n- note 3.7 is still required, given the TF limitations given in issues #1124, but at least now DLC package does build in 3.8; meaning we are getting away from pip dependency issues
