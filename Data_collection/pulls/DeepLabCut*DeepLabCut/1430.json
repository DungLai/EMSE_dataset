on issue #1380, and in particular comment https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1380#issuecomment-880386594, here is a DLC environment that works on M1 chips (freshly acquired - today - macbook pro was used for testing that had High Sierra installed). \r\n\r\nUse this (DEEPLABCUT_M1.yaml) conda file if you have an M1, and follow these steps:\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut M1 chip installation environment instructions (assuming you have anaconda installed!):\r\n\r\n(1) git clone the deeplabcut cut repo:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`\r\n\r\n(2) in the program terminal, `cd DeepLabCut/conda-environments`\r\n\r\n(3) Click here to download the Rosetta wheel for TensorFlow
