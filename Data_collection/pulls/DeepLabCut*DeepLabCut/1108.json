Added possibility to rotate video based on arbitrary angles using ffmpeg rotate. It uses radians which is a bit annnoying but I can try and change it for degrees. Also added a box to GUI. It's my first time doing anything like it so feedback will be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10. I currently have no Linux or MacOS to check if it works ok there.\r\n\r\nKonrad","created_at":"2021-02-09T11:43:02Z","updated_at":"2021-03-28T17:04:36Z","closed_at":"2021-03-28T17:04:36Z","merged_at":"2021-03-28T17:04:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"c76174d3de7f70bb09d2667f7d241c73a839fd9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pulls/1108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pulls/1108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/statuses/a405b26188b899f5746f2c2e939fc86575599a24","head":{"label":"KonradDanielewski:master","ref":"master","sha":"a405b26188b899f5746f2c2e939fc86575599a24","user":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"DeepLabCut:master","ref":"master","sha":"06c4a16828c6c335f7d332da3060516d29857893","user":{"login":"DeepLabCut","id":59848143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU5ODQ4MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59848143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126897385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTczODU=","name":"DeepLabCut","full_name":"DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DeepLabCut","id":59848143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU5ODQ4MTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59848143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeepLabCut/received_events","type":"Organ
