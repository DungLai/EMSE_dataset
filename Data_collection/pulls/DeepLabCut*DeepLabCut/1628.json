Goal: \r\ntesting related to #1625 , where it appears multiple installations of opencv occur, causing issues on COLAB (note, within local conda env this is not an issue).\r\n\r\n## Likely Issue:\r\n- in testing it seems tensorflow 2.7 included `opencv-python` in dependencies:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"858\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-29 at 12 22 52 PM\"
