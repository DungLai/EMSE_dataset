This simplification became possible with the changes introduced to `Check4weights`\r\n\r\nThe changes made are backed up by tests, which are also added to the codebase in this PR.\r\n\r\nFinally, here is a simple example script that a user can run to download model weights for a given model type ahead of time.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nfrom deeplabcut.utils.auxfun_models import MODELTYPE_FILEPATH_MAP, Downloadweights\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    # Multiple model types can be provided separated by spaces.\r\n    modeltypes = sys.argv[1:]\r\n    valid_modeltypes = list(MODELTYPE_FILEPATH_MAP.keys())\r\n    for modeltype in modeltypes:\r\n        if modeltype in valid_modeltypes:\r\n            Downloadweights(modeltype)\r\n        else:\r\n            print(\r\n                f\"{modeltype} is not valid.
