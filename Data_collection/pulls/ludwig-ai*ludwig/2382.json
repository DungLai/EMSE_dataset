Only the training dataset is required.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a couple of exceptions that arise when a user's configuration results in an empty validation or an empty test set when relying on Ludwig's random splitting during data preprocessing when `0` is used as one of the split probabilities, i.e.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npreprocessing:\r\n    split:\r\n        probabilities: [0.7, 0, 0.3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1: `ValueError: need at least one array to stack`\r\n\r\nThis comes from `to_numpy_dataset()` when it gets an empty data frame. The fix is to call `to_list()` instead of `np.stack()` if the dataframe is empty.\r\n\r\n### 2: `ValueError: Dataset is empty following preprocessing`\r\n\r\nThis comes from `backend.dataset_manager.create()`. The fix is to move checking for empty datasets after creating the validation and test datasets, pass if the validation or test datasets are empty, and raise a `ValueError` specifically if the training set is empty.\r\n\r\n### Fix: Zombie test datasets.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a fix to `RandomSplitter` to ensure that the test set is certainly empty if the split probability for it is `0`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2368, Co-authored-by @arnavgarg1
