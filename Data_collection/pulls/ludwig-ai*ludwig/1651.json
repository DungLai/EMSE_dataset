However, the keys of a `torch.nn.ModuleDict` cannot have the same name as any ModuleDict class attributes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\ntorch.nn.ModuleDict({'type': torch.nn.Module()})    # Raises KeyError \"attribute 'type' already exists\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dir(torch.nn.ModuleDict())` gives us a full list of other feature names that would run into the same issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n['T_destination', '__annotations__', '__call__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattr__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__setstate__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_apply', '_backward_hooks', '_buffers', '_call_impl', '_forward_hooks', '_forward_pre_hooks', '_get_backward_hooks', '_get_name', '_is_full_backward_hook', '_load_from_state_dict', '_load_state_dict_pre_hooks', '_maybe_warn_non_full_backward_hook', '_modules', '_named_members', '_non_persistent_buffers_set', '_parameters', '_register_load_state_dict_pre_hook', '_register_state_dict_hook', '_replicate_for_data_parallel', '_save_to_state_dict', '_slow_forward', '_state_dict_hooks', '_version', 'add_module', 'apply', 'bfloat16', 'buffers', 'children', 'clear', 'cpu', 'cuda', 'double', 'dump_patches', 'eval', 'extra_repr', 'float', 'forward', 'get_buffer', 'get_extra_state', 'get_parameter', 'get_submodule', 'half', 'items', 'keys', 'load_state_dict', 'modules', 'named_buffers', 'named_children', 'named_modules', 'named_parameters', 'parameters', 'pop', 'register_backward_hook', 'register_buffer', 'register_forward_hook', 'register_forward_pre_hook', 'register_full_backward_hook', 'register_parameter', 'requires_grad_', 'set_extra_state', 'share_memory', 'state_dict', 'to', 'to_empty', 'train', 'training', 'type', 'update', 'values', 'xpu', 'zero_grad']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis poses a problem for datasets like `SyntheticFraud` where one of the features is literally called `type`. It seems limiting to force Ludwig users to rename their features in their dataset just because they conflict with torchâ€™s `ModuleDict` class attributes.\r\n\r\nApplying suffixes to feature names (internally) is more overhead, but it also guarantees that we can bypass this restriction, regardless of the user's original feature names.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-06T01:57:28Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T23:27:21Z","closed_at":"2022-01-13T23:27:18Z","merged_at":"2022-01-13T23:27:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a383e00b044bd18d3c81d8edd8938041f7962ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"hungcs","id":85463385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDYzMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85463385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs","html_url":"https://github.com/hungcs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hungcs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/704c8b83b71d5f993c9d01d773f6d8076524531e","head":{"label":"ludwig-ai:error_messages","ref":"error_messages","sha":"704c8b83b71d5f993c9d01d773f6d8076524531e","user":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163346054,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMzNDYwNTQ=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"ludwig-ai/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://ap
