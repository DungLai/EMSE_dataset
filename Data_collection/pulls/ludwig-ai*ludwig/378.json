It turns out all other pages except the landing page use `mkdocs-material`, that has Font Awesome arrow right weight **REGULAR**  as standard. However, if I want to use it in the html directly, only  Font Awesome arrow-right weight **SOLID** is free, the **REGULAR** needs a paid account. I tried to just copy and paste the arrow from the `css` already minified for the other pages, but then the icon breaks\r\n- I still did **not** run `mkdocs build` because there might be more style changes.","created_at":"2019-06-16T18:27:43Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T00:46:15Z","closed_at":"2019-06-16T22:12:52Z","merged_at":"2019-06-16T22:12:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d98a26cf6b93bae379037da8a018a398950e0e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/54c8fa6f60c4d6d055ccba83f3b23aa2bdc0845c","head":{"label":"IgorWilbert:update-landing-page-layout","ref":"update-landing-page-layout","sha":"54c8fa6f60c4d6d055ccba83f3b23aa2bdc0845c","user":{"login":"IgorWilbert","id":42987854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg3ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42987854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert","html_url":"https://github.com/IgorWilbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"ludwig-ai:master","ref":"master","sha":"9fd2bc29f6c670dfc9b85df2da9717cf0ededdef","user":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163346054,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMzNDYwNTQ=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"ludwig-ai/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig","description":"Data-centric
