Compared to `master`, we see preprocessing times for a benchmark audio dataset of approximately 7k files decrease from >90 minutes (anecdotally, please confirm @connor-mccorm) to ~18 minutes. Additionally, because of the dedicated URL read functionality, we see a significant reduction in read errors originating from `torchaudio.load`.\r\n\r\nFuture work could include using `ray.data.read_binary_files` or ray Tasks directly. We opt for the method introduced in this PR instead due to errors related to Dask indexing. A follow-up PR will implement parallelized URL reads for image features.","created_at":"2022-05-18T16:06:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T01:03:27Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T01:03:25Z","merged_at":"2022-06-03T01:03:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0a486b58af9adce5efdff38df4582b47bc71262","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/7f56b6817f453a6d070828919230a8417a77c430","head":{"label":"ludwig-ai:speedup-url-load","ref":"speedup-url-load","sha":"7f56b6817f453a6d070828919230a8417a77c430","user":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163346054,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMzNDYwNTQ=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"ludwig-ai/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig","description":"Data-centric
