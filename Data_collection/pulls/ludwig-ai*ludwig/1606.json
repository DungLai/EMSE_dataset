Adds similar dataclasses for all known optimizers.\r\n* Expanding our current custom marshmallow definitions and fixing a lot of the issues that were holdovers from the original combiner PR a couple months ago. Tests are fleshed out as well.\r\n* The `marshmallow_dataclass` package does not currently support setting metadata on the generated JSON schemas for the new dataclasses easily. In particular, to keep the `description` in these schemas up to date, this PR adds scripting to extract and apply dataclass docstrings to their corresponding schemas during generation. To make this efficient, the parsed structures of these dataclasses are actually saved as separate JSON files that will also now be distributed.\r\n\r\n## Specifics\r\n### Removes:\r\n* `bucketing_field`, re: [discussion](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/1606#discussion_r772705787)\r\n* All `sgd` aliases except for `sgd` are now invalid\r\n\r\n### Adds:\r\n* New package: `pytkdocs`, used for parsing dataclass structures.\r\n* `scripts/extract_schema.py`\r\n* `TrainerConfig` marshmallow dataclass to handle hyperparameters, while attributes related to device config (e.g. `skip_save_model`) are left on the `init` function.\r\n* `BaseOptimizer` marshmallow dataclass and children that support each optimizer type in `optimization_modules`.\r\n* `ludwig/marshmallow`, which organizes the major marshmallow-related structures.\r\n    * `ludwig/marshmallow/test_classes.py`, which now contains (the moved) `CustomTestCombiner` class and other utilties for testing marshmallow-based classes. These test classes are moved here so that `pytkdocs` can parse inheritance relationships correctly.\r\n    * `ludwig/marshmallow/generated`, which organizes the parsed output of `pytkdocs` into separate JSON files for each marshmallow class. These are also included in the `MANIFEST.in` file.\r\n* docstrings for optimizer, trainer, combiner dataclasses\r\n* docstring extraction/application logic in `schema_utils.py`\r\n* Tests for existing marshmallow schema and utils in `tests/ludwig/marshmallow`.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* `optimizer_registry` is now a `Registry` rather than just a `dict`.\r\n* Keeps `Clipper` as a separate dataclass, renamed to `GradientClippingConfig`\r\n* Renames `clipper` param and all related uses to `gradient_clipping_config`  to be consistent. `gradient_clipping` is also the valid keyword for Ludwig YAML.\r\n* `clip_grads` is moved out of the clipping dataclass and is now a method of `Trainer`\r\n* Moved/split `tests/ludwig/utils/test_schema.py` into different files.\r\n* In `base.py`, the `Trainer` is initialized using `load_config_with_kwargs`\r\n* Subtlety: when `gradient_clipping` is set to `None` the internal trainer representation does **not** disable gradient clipping but rather uses the default values from `GradientClippingConfig()` (in particular, `clipglobalnorm` is not `None`). This is due to the follow-up case below.\r\n* Subtlety: sets all marshmallow dataclasses (trainer, combiners, optimizers) to exclude (`marshmallow.EXCLUDE`) additional properties but helper function manually sets all schemas' `additionalProperties` attribute to True. This is to mirror current Ludwig behavior - in which you can specify any parameter and Ludwig can pick and fill in intelligently. The schema attribute is manually changed because the `marshmallow_dataclass` package does not support INCLUDE/EXCLUDE keywords (since Python dataclasses require declaring all attributes in advance).\r\n\r\n### Follow-up PRs/Investigations:\r\n- [ ] Add Github action for extracting schema and diffing against branch. Tracked at: https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/1867\r\n- [ ] Change docstrings to be less developer-focused and more end-user focused in jargon/vocab.\r\n- [ ] Move marshmallow config classes into `ludwig/marshmallow` to streamline other files and to allow importing into `defaults.py` without circular imports\r\n    - [ ] More generally, remove duplicate values from `defaults.py` - source of truth should now exist on the dataclasses themselves.\r\n    - [ ] Perhaps move json-related `schema.py` methods as well.\r\n    - [ ] Note: have to resolve the correct defaults for the complex schema (e.g. `eval_batch_size` should resolve to default out of all choices: https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/1907)\r\n- [ ] Flesh out remaining docstrings, marked in the code by `TODO: Document parameters.`\r\n- [ ] Investigate why `nan`s are produced by `test_model_training_options.py/resume training` for `sgd`, if `gradient_clipping.clipglobalnorm` is None.\r\n- [ ] Simplify or further clarify `learning_rate` hand-off flow (LR set to auto vs. LR not set at all) in `Trainer.__init__`. \r\n    - Somewhat odd from the user's perspective that they not specify a parameter and assume Ludwig will automatically choose its value but for `learning_rate` and certain other parameters you can explicitly set `auto`, which performs a similar behavior. Maybe choose a different word instead of `auto`?\r\n- [ ] Investigate potentially streamlining current marshmallow definitions even further (deserialize/nesting overloading)\r\n- [ ] Consider simplifying usage of `None` in various registries.\r\n    - [ ] `initializer_registry` - removing this as part of this PR\r\n    - [ ] `activations` - can't just delete `None` key here, consider replacing with `identity`\r\n    - [ ] `reduce_mode_registry`","created_at":"2021-12-17T19:40:43Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T19:22:00Z","closed_at":"2022-04-01T04:01:12Z","merged_at":"2022-04-01T04:01:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"23a33eef3bc7ea3ba33ec56dc9b56ba38462648a","assignee":{"login":"ksbrar","id":4261338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjEzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4261338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar","html_url":"https://github.com/ksbrar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ksbrar","id":4261338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjEzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4261338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar","html_url":"https://github.com/ksbrar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ShreyaR","id":5787923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODc5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5787923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyaR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1174068769,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTc0MDY4NzY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
