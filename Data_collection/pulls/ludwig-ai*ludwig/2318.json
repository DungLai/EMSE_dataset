I believe that in some instances (small dataset with a large number of partitions, empty partitions, etc.), there isn't enough data in the first Dask partition for Dask to infer the meta correctly (or at all). \r\n\r\nThis PR updates `from_ray_dataset` within our DaskEngine to use a custom implementation that creates meta information from the first 100 rows of the ray dataset and uses it during the creation of the Dask DataFrame from the Ray Dataset. Dask won't need to infer the meta information anymore for the dataframe, guaranteeing fewer problems in downstream transformations. This gives us more downstream control.\r\n\r\nThe hack has been added because in Ray 1.12 and 1.13, the resulting column from `read_binary_files` was cast into type object for being passed into Dask, but in Ray nightly, they've started casting the column to type TensorDtype (thanks for the catch @geoffreyangus). This change is also needed for https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/2241 to pass the tests for Ray nightly.","created_at":"2022-07-27T08:04:51Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T10:39:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T10:39:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d7efdbe0c0bbe63b59f85ee2ee29a1c1262d172","assignee":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"geoffreyangus","id":29719151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29719151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus","html_url":"https://github.com/geoffreyangus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/8355fe2aae531aaad0f1c3ecd7b2a40d58148096","head":{"label":"ludwig-ai:custom_to_dask","ref":"custom_to_dask","sha":"8355fe2aae531aaad0f1c3ecd7b2a40d58148096","user":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/follow
