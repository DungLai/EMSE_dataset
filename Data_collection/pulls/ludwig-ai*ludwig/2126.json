The issues in the original implementation were twofold:\r\n\r\n1. Some weirdness in the interaction between the Torchscript compiler and the weights shared between `torch.nn.Module` objects. This is a somewhat known issue (HuggingFace explicitly accounts for it through a `torchscript` flag: [link](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v1.0.0/torchscript.html#torchscript-flag-and-tied-weights)). This PR works around it by first registering a module with the exact same properties as the shared module, then doing an overwriting assignment to the shared module immediately following.\r\n2. Inability to script custom `autograd.Function` subclasses. This is also a known issue (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/22329). This PR works around it by decomposing the `forward` functions of the custom classes into standalone functions, which are scriptable.\r\n\r\nThe following validation was run in order to test the new changes: \r\n1. A new test was added in `tests/integration_tests/test_torchscript.py` which tests that a trained LudwigModel (with a TabNet combiner) has the same outputs as its torchscript equivalent.\r\n2. Existing tests were modified in order to ensure that the custom autograd classes remained unchanged.\r\n3. Two Ludwig models were trained on the Titanic dataset with a TabNet combiner. One was on the master branch (commit: `dd026ca2fb9e7e9dc0ef7fb9bcc73ccaae01b8a7`) and one was on this branch (commit: `34fe6da455d44edb8b6cb4947f4595303cf3511d`). The models were more or less the same: \r\n![tabnet-performance-comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29719151/172950989-6e4e3933-44e8-42cf-9939-d15c1754b3da.png) \r\nFull config here:
