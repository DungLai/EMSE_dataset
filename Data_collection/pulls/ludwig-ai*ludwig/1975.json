Currently, if you set the default of e.g. a `PositiveInteger` to be non-null value like `128`, this automatically prevents `None` from being a valid value for that field. But we want this in some cases, e.g. `bn_virtual_bs` on `TabNet` schema in which setting that field to `None` actually disables it.\r\n- Updates `bn_virtual_bs`.\r\n- Replaces default placeholder text for marshmallow fields with empty string. Sets all occurrences of \"TODO: Document parameters\" to empty string as well.\r\n\r\n### Only merge after
