Descendants of MeanMetric (any LossMetric) were not getting reset between epoch, and thus were reporting a global cumulative average, not an epoch average.\r\n\r\n- Changes LudwigModule's `_callable_losses` property to just `_losses`, and changes `add_loss` to `update_loss`.  This is only used for one thing: TabNet's Sparsity loss term.  In tensorflow, `add_loss` made sense because the call operator is only really called once to build the graph, as opposed to Torch's `forward` method which is called on every forward pass.  So, now we update the sparsity loss on every forward pass and include it in the overall train loss.\r\n\r\n- Sets model into evaluation mode when generating predictions  using `model.train()` and `model.eval()`.  TorchModule's `training` property controls whether batch norm updates its running statistics, and whether drop out drops channels.  If we generate predictions while `training` is True, the predictions will be wrong if dropout or batch norm are used.","created_at":"2022-01-09T23:50:02Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T20:11:39Z","closed_at":"2022-01-10T19:31:25Z","merged_at":"2022-01-10T19:31:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ebc65bf02381fca253d4d8f68ec4b690091ce26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ShreyaR","id":5787923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODc5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5787923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyaR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/0b849a6325b0185fbc17ddef53c181e912ff7c6d","head":{"label":"dantreiman:dantreiman/tabular_data_training_issues","ref":"dantreiman/tabular_data_training_issues","sha":"0b849a6325b0185fbc17ddef53c181e912ff7c6d","user":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":435991506,"node_id":"R_kgDOGfyz0g","name":"ludwig","full_name":"dantreiman/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman/ludwig","description":"Data-centric
