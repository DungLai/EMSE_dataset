This allows us to, for example, perform a grid search over a set of complete Ludwig configs, as opposed to needing to specify config params individually and search over all combinations.\r\n\r\nTo provide a parameter that represents a full top-level Ludwig config, the `.` key name can be used.\r\n\r\nNested parameters can also be merged in order of the parameters in the `hyperopt` section (last param applied takes precedence). \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhyperopt:\r\n    parameters:\r\n        .:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories:\r\n                - \r\n                    combiner:\r\n                        type: tabnet\r\n                    trainer:\r\n                        learning_rate: 0.001\r\n                        batch_size: 64\r\n                -\r\n                    combiner:\r\n                        type: concat\r\n                    trainer:\r\n                        batch_size: 256\r\n        trainer:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories:\r\n                -\r\n                    regularization_lambda: 2.0\r\n                    regularization_type: l2\r\n                -\r\n                    regularization_lambda: 4.0\r\n                    regularization_type: l1\r\n        trainer.decay_rate:\r\n            space: loguniform\r\n            lower: 0.001\r\n            upper: 0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill yield trial configs like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncombiner:\r\n    type: tabnet\r\ntrainer:\r\n    learning_rate: 0.001\r\n    batch_size: 64\r\n    regularization_lambda: 4.0\r\n    regularization_type: l1\r\n    decay_rate: 0.01\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the previous `defaults` section handling, which has been superseded by the more general `defaults` section in the base Ludwig config.","created_at":"2022-09-02T03:10:23Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T18:18:39Z","closed_at":"2022-09-06T16:51:22Z","merged_at":"2022-09-06T16:51:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9a7b7767ec10f0083f5d001316cb22205382e61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/2445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/f73981fffe367942619540ca0d1fcae2b332d800","head":{"label":"ludwig-ai:nested-hyperopt","ref":"nested-hyperopt","sha":"f73981fffe367942619540ca0d1fcae2b332d800","user":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163346054,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMzNDYwNTQ=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"ludwig-ai/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ludwig-ai","id":65477820,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NDc3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65477820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludwig-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig","description":"Data-centric
