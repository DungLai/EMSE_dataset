change ensures that there are always at least 2 CPUs available for Ray Dataset related when running hyperopt trials with a RayBackend to prevent trials from stalling. \r\n\r\nThis is particularly helpful on RayBackends that are entirely composed of CPUs to prevent infinite stalls when running hyperopt when `num_samples` >= number of available CPUs on the machine or cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR is
