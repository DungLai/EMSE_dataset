PR introduces additional model type GBM (tree learner), as an alternative to ECD.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n- supports only single output feature of type binary, number or category\r\n\r\nIn scope:\r\n- adding `model_type` to the Ludwig config\r\n- adding `type` to the trainer section of the Ludwig config\r\n- introducing an `BaseModel` class, implemented by both ECD and GBM\r\n- moving trainers into a separate folder\r\n- implementing GBM training functionality in `LightGBMTrainer` and `LightGBMRayTrainer`\r\n\r\nOut of scope:\r\n- support for non-trainable feature encoders (e.g. pretrained text embeddings) => follow-up PR\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [x] update/add tests reflecting new `model_type` functionality\r\n- [x] replace occurences of ECD with `AbstractModel`\r\n- [x] add tests for new GBM functionality\r\n- [x] finish GBM implementation\r\n\r\nHelp needed:\r\n- [x] ~Alternative to having separate trainer registry per backend (local, ray)~ OK for now\r\n- [x] How to correctly update the schema `model_type` and trainer `type` (Thanks
