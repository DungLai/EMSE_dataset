It adds a `bounding_box` output feature to the library. This way the user can train models with `bounding_box` output like it is encountered in object detection. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only implemented measure is IOU (Intersection-Over-Union). The current default loss is the smoothed L1 loss (also called Huber loss) used by the Fast R-CNN algorithm. I plan to add the YOLO v3 localization loss as well. The following snippet runs flawlessly, but I might have forgotten key additions to make this feature usable so feel free to change it/let me know!\r\n\r\nBasic test that I ran:\r\n```python\r\nfrom ludwig.api import LudwigModel\r\nfrom sklearn import datasets\r\nimport pandas as pd \r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\niris = datasets.load_iris()\r\ntraining_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=['a','b','c','d'])\r\ntraining_dataframe['target'] = list(map(lambda x: np.array([x,x,x,x]), iris['target']))\r\n\r\n# train a model\r\nmodel_definition = {\r\n\t'input_features': [\r\n\t\t{'name': 'a', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'b', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'c', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'd', 'type': 'numerical'}\r\n\t], \r\n\t'output_features': [{'name': 'target', 'type': 'bounding_box'}]\r\n}\r\nmodel = LudwigModel(model_definition)\r\ntrain_stats = model.train(training_dataframe)\r\npredictions =
