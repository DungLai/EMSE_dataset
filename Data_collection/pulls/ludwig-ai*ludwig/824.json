Note:  While I could not recreate the error on my side, I believe this will address the problem because all internal data structures are now tensors.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the refactoring, I added unit test `test_custom_metrics.py` for the two modified custom metrics.\r\n```\r\npytest -v /opt/project/tests/integration_tests/test_custom_metrics.py\r\n============================================== test session starts ==============================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.9, pytest-6.0.1, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- /usr/bin/python3\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: /opt/project\r\nplugins: pycharm-0.7.0, xdist-1.34.0, forked-1.3.0, typeguard-2.9.1\r\ncollected 2 items\r\n\r\n../../../tests/integration_tests/test_custom_metrics.py::test_R2Score PASSED                              [ 50%]\r\n../../../tests/integration_tests/test_custom_metrics.py::test_ErrorScore PASSED                           [100%]\r\n\r\n=============================================== 2 passed in 0.19s ===============================================\r\n```\r\n\r\n@w4nderlust If this PR looks good, I recommend merging it so that @ifokeev can confirm the fix since I could not recreate the problem.  \r\n\r\nThere is one more custom metric to refactor.
