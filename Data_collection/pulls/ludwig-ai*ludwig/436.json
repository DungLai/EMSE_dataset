Re-organize setup.py to simply read from a source file and avoid double efforts when modifying libraries.\r\n2. Add support to GCS, pandas read_csv already supports reading files from Google Cloud Storage, we just need gcsfs library.\r\nVia pip install ludwig[gcs]\r\n3. Support extras in setup.py for GCS support\r\n4. Change pydantic version due to Fast.ai\r\n\r\n```error: pydantic 0.30.1 is installed but pydantic<=0.30.0,>=0.30 is required by {'fastapi'}```\r\n\r\n# Code Pull Requests\r\n\r\nPlease provide the

Documentation Pull Requests\r\n\r\nNote that the documentation HTML files are in `docs/` while the Markdown sources are in `mkdocs/docs`.\r\n\r\nIf you are proposing a modification to the documentation you should change only the Markdown files, then recreate the documentation as explained in the `mkdocs/README.md` file with `mkdocs build`, which will create the HTML files automatically, and only after this create a commit.\r\n\r\n`api.md` is automatically generated from the docstrings in the code, so if you want to change something in that file, first modify `ludwig/api.py` docstring, then run `mkdocs/code_docs_autogen.py`, which will create `mkdocs/docs/api.md` and then finally run `mkdocs build` which will generate the HTML in `docs/`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-18T16:58:34Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T22:05:48Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T22:05:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f1d2ae0adac6cdc4af69da078f329d864ec493d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/2daaada008febe8adc71b569e4a133cb56d81272","head":{"label":"gogasca:gcs_support","ref":"gcs_support","sha":"2daaada008febe8adc71b569e4a133cb56d81272","user":{"login":"gogasca","id":30065079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDY1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30065079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca","html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197624594,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc2MjQ1OTQ=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"gogasca/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gogasca","id":30065079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDY1MDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30065079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca","html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogasca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gogasca/ludwig","description":"Ludwig
