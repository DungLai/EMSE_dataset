Want to get some feedback on the approach before moving forward with that. \r\nCould either do multipart form uploads or base64 encoding in the request body. I imagine the latter would be more costly but form uploads are generally a worse API for inference on tabular data and NLP. \r\n\r\n# Documentation Pull Requests\r\nWill do after settling on an

change only the Markdown files, then recreate the documentation as explained in the `mkdocs/README.md` file with `mkdocs build`, which will create the HTML files automatically, and only after this
