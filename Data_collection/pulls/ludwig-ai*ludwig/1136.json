Please do not merge.\r\n\r\nA bit explanation about the workaround:\r\n- Due to Issue #1134 -- the `self.features` attribute is missing, I appended a `self.features` so it can work with IteratableBatcher without errors.\r\n\r\n- Due to Issue #1135  -- on petfinder dataset, after the dict comprehension we'll get an empty dict which will cause an error when reading data batches. I remove the `if `reshape` in training_set_metadata[feature[NAME]]` and seem to work around the issue.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-28T22:02:45Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T18:22:34Z","closed_at":"2021-04-01T18:22:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"322417a6ed3b6e0cc10eb3a123b82831a1202a60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/1136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/statuses/587c2df8a704298ce17b3fa20245d6b08b76e528","head":{"label":"zhisbug:parquet-workaround","ref":"parquet-workaround","sha":"587c2df8a704298ce17b3fa20245d6b08b76e528","user":{"login":"zhisbug","id":1654062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTQwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1654062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug","html_url":"https://github.com/zhisbug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":352436300,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTI0MzYzMDA=","name":"ludwig","full_name":"zhisbug/ludwig","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhisbug","id":1654062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTQwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1654062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug","html_url":"https://github.com/zhisbug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhisbug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhisbug/ludwig","description":"Ludwig
