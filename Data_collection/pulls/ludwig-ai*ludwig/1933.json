Namely, it (1) removes their dependency on Numpy, (2) enforces stricter typing throughout, and (3) brings constants into local scope in the case of `resize_image`.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR assumes `torchvision` is a part of the minimal Ludwig installation because `try` blocks and `import` statements are not permitted in torchscript code. Concretely, I've removed the `torchvision` checks in `resize_image` and `grayscale`â€“ however, those checks are not currently doing anything in any case because `import torchvision.transforms.functional as F` is currently already located at the top of the file. **That said, we still probably should NOT merge this in until we reach a resolution for
