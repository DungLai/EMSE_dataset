It clearly has a state (and could be useful when \"trained\" on a large set of dirty categories and then applied to new incoming data) - but saving a translation table in a class would be costly. An alternative would be to go from a clustered distance matrix to a K-means representation based on string distances (where each centroid is the most frequent cluster exemplar).\r\n\r\nIt's currently WIP because I still want to add an example/documentation.\r\n\r\nFWIW this function was immediately useful in my work, but its usefulness depends on the structure of your data:\r\nIf there are few underlying categories, which might be corrupted by typos or alternative spellings, then it should work well out of the box.","created_at":"2022-09-11T12:19:38Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T15:36:16Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T15:36:16Z","merged_at":"2023-01-17T15:36:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"c545ed9d4b448077385a971247ed26f3cbe8d069","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/milestones/4/labels","id":8406778,"node_id":"MI_kwDOB3LOgs4AgEb6","number":4,"title":"0.4.0
