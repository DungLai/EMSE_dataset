It seems that using the `HashingVectorizer` instead of `CountVectorizer` is always better (no cost for f1 score, and almost always faster, see plot). If the user want to tradeoff performance for speed, it seems better to play with the `ngram_range` than changing the encoder. Therefore I recommend to just use the `HashingVectorizer` for `fuzzy_join`, instead of using it only for big datasets like in #420.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing what other people think!\r\n<img
