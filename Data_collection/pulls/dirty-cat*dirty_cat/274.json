Indeed, scikit-learn for now only supports running the tests with X_types: [2darray].\r\nThe tests could run on the SuperVectorizer, which doesn't have this tag, but I've commented this test for now: it seems that some parts of the scikit learn test do not work when converting the input to a pandas
