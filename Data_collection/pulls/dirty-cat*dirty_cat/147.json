is a major refactor of the file ``fetching.py``, that is in charge of fetching datasets off the web.\r\nHistorically, they were fetched from various websites.\r\n\r\nOur aim with this update is to only use OpenML.org's API, through Scikit-learn's [``fetch_openml()``](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml.html) function.\r\nThis allows us to have a much more reliable and unified interface, and avoids losing access to datasets due to deletion, renaming, etc.\r\n\r\nFor instance, with the current system, 4 on the 7 datasets are unavailable (403 Access Denied, website down, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe user-interface stays the same with the functions ``fetch_*()`` (e.g ``fetch_open_payments()``), still returning a similar dictionary.\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing this, not all the datasets have been uploaded to OpenML ; I will take care of this in the coming week(s).\r\n\r\nNow unecessary code has been removed from ``utils.py`` files.\r\n\r\n*Note on the testing part: this is my first time experimenting with mocking
