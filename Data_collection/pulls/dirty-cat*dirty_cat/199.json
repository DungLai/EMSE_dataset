I think the reason behind this is that users are not supposed to know your labeling conventions, and therefore they are not the best persons to decide which labels should be used.\r\nHowever, most users opening an issue know whether it is to report a bug, ask for a new feature, say something about the documentation, and so on...\r\nThis PR proposes to add a few issue templates with predefined text and labels in order to ease this process. Namely:\r\n\r\n- a bug report template\r\n- a documentation template\r\n- a feature request template\r\n\r\nNote that you can easily add/remove them (maybe you'll also need a usage question template and so on...).\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this if you don't think it's relevant :wink:
