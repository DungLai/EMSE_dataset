Migrate metadata from `setup.py` to `setup.cfg` and prepare the ground for \"everything on `pyproject.toml`\".\r\n2. During the setup in `setup.py`, we parse `setup.cfg` to extract the `required_dependencies`, and create a `dirty_cat/_config_requirements.py` file.\r\n3.  Finally, when `dirty_cat` is imported, we check that the installed dependencies versions match the required versions from the `dirty_cat/_config_requirements.py` file and raise an `ImportError` otherwise.\r\n\r\n- Also, some housekeeping by removing `requirements.txt` and `requirements-min.txt` that are no longer used thanks to the `setup.cfg` and updating `.github/workflow/testing.yml` accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Comments\r\n\r\nPrior to that PR, pip reduces the likelihood of making mistakes by raising an error when the user updates a package to a version that is out of the required version scope. However, after the error message, the updated version is installed anyway.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"717\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 15 43 42\"

user, which will have weird bugs after importing the module.\r\n\r\nThis PR helps enforce the required versions by raising an error when importing `dirty_cat` with incorrect dependencies versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ python -c \"import dirty_cat\"\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File
