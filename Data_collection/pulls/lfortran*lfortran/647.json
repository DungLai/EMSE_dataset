If the It is okay if the start and end locations are the same\r\nthese messages are mostly aimed towards other tools e.g. linter and not humans.\r\n\r\n### Diagnostic level to string\r\n\r\nI moved the creation of `message_type` into a single routine to decrease the chances of \"human\" and \"short\"\r\nerror formats getting out of sync.\r\n\r\n### Using `struct` for ANSI in `diagnostics.cpp`\r\n\r\nI also replaced the hard-coded ANSI codes with a struct in diagnostics but\r\nthere is an existing `terminal.h` consider using that instead\r\nof the ColorsANSI or the hardcoded colors.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, one can use an external library like\r\nrang: https://github.com/agauniyal/rang\r\n\r\nThat change can be ignored by dropping commit 1cbeb578f886bb3d1e92b27033f6347d65259cc8\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Add option to only check for semantics and report diagnostics.
