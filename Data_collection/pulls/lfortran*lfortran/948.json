Since LLVM 15 we are not supposed to do that. In https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/commit/cf481fd69d4b6cd781eb0734997599421ceacc1b, data only arrays also passed the `arr_descr->is_array(...)` check but they shouldn't. In this PR we make sure that we only call `arr_descr->convert_to_argument(...)` only for descriptor arrays. See the updated if check for the same.\r\n\r\n`minpack` (commit - 8217d0822a1ec01d71d0aa006a6ffe3134fcbd13) compilation status using this PR is,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[  2%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/minpack.f90.o\r\n[  4%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/covar.f.o\r\n[  6%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/errjac.f.o\r\n[  8%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hybipt.f.o\r\n[ 10%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lhesfcn.f.o\r\n[ 12%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmdipt.f.o\r\n[ 14%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/ocpipt.f.o\r\n[ 16%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/r1updt.f.o\r\n[ 18%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/vecjac.f.o\r\n[ 20%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/chkder.f.o\r\n[ 22%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/dmchar.f.o\r\n[ 24%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/fdjac1.f.o\r\n[ 26%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hybrd1.f.o\r\n[ 28%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmder1.f.o\r\n[ 30%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmpar.f.o\r\n[ 32%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/qform.f.o\r\n[ 34%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/rwupdt.f.o\r\n[ 36%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/dogleg.f.o\r\n[ 38%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/fdjac2.f.o\r\n[ 40%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hybrd.f.o\r\n[ 42%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmder.f.o\r\n[ 44%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmstr1.f.o\r\n[ 46%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/qrfac.f.o\r\n[ 48%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/ssqfcn.f.o\r\n[ 51%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/dpmpar.f.o\r\n[ 53%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/grdfcn.f.o\r\n[ 55%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hybrj1.f.o\r\n[ 57%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmdif1.f.o\r\n[ 59%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmstr.f.o\r\n[ 61%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/qrsolv.f.o\r\n[ 63%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/ssqjac.f.o\r\n[ 65%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/enorm.f.o\r\n[ 67%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hesfcn.f.o\r\n[ 69%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/hybrj.f.o\r\n[ 71%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/lmdif.f.o\r\n[ 73%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/objfcn.f.o\r\n[ 75%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/r1mpyq.f.o\r\n[ 77%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/vecfcn.f.o\r\n[ 79%] Linking Fortran static library libminpack.a\r\n[ 79%] Built target minpack\r\nScanning dependencies of target example_lmdif1\r\n[ 81%] Building Fortran object examples/CMakeFiles/example_lmdif1.dir/example_lmdif1.f90.o\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\ncode generation error: asr_to_llvm: module failed verification.
