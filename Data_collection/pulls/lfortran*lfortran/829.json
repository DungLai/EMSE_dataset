When I try to generate the cpp I get this:\r\n    ```\r\n    ❯ lfortran --show-cpp ./integration_tests/doloop_08.f90\r\n    [1]    349292 segmentation fault (core dumped)  lfortran --show-cpp ./integration_tests/doloop_08.f90\r\n    ```\r\n    This is only happening in a no-var do-loop case.\r\n\r\n2. I am not sure what labels must be added to the test in `integration_tests/CMakeLists.txt`\r\n\r\n3. The test output looks like this which is failing because of another test\r\n    <details>\r\n    <summary>Test output</summary>\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ❯ ctest\r\n    ./run_tests.py\r\n    Test project /home/rush/Desktop/oss/lfortran\r\n        Start 1: test_cwrapper\r\n    1/3 Test #1: test_cwrapper ....................
