Tested manually with `spambug` and `component` data fetched with the `scripts/retrieve_training_metrics.py` script.\r\n\r\nThe `analyze_training_metrics.py` was broken (because of how it extracted fields from file names), so I fixed that as well. It was not simple to install the environment due to some dependencies like xgboost and libgit2, but since they weren't necessary for this issue I simply skipped them.\r\n\r\nI think it should be ready to merge. Please confirm that this is what was intended for #945.\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever PR to an open source project. So please do tell me if I've done anything wrong.","created_at":"2020-09-27T09:08:07Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T14:40:28Z","closed_at":"2020-09-28T14:40:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e354b83e806a1dba50037113fcc46f72ecc1019","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/pulls/1825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/pulls/1825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/issues/1825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/bugbug/statuses/0cafdb6ad271a252be85aea8f0e00717ceef3de1","head":{"label":"alopezz:pr/945_plot_binary_models","ref":"pr/945_plot_binary_models","sha":"0cafdb6ad271a252be85aea8f0e00717ceef3de1","user":{"login":"alopezz","id":39034209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDM0MjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39034209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz","html_url":"https://github.com/alopezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"mozilla:master","ref":"master","sha":"184a2c1337b3914f5cc70b7447544cd6d9b6d99d","user":{"login":"mozilla","id":131524,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzMTUyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124910572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQ5MTA1NzI=","name":"bugbug","full_name":"mozilla/bugbug","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mozilla","id":131524,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzMTUyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mozilla/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug","description":"Platform
