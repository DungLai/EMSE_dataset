Otherwise, if intervals/quantiles are implemented, returns variance of a normal with same IQR as the predictions\r\n* `predict_proba` uses `predict` as location and square root of `predict_var` as scale parameter. If `predict_var` is not directly implemented, leverages its default behaviour to get this from intervals/quantiles.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a soft dependency on `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-probability`, localized to a `dl` dependency set.\r\nThis dependency set is added to dependency specifications where necessary; a function `_check_dl_dependencies` to check and raise error if the dependency is not installed is introduced.\r\n\r\nFurther, this PR turns on a number of tests to work for `predict_var` and `predict_proba`, by adding defaults for these methods to the scenarios.\r\n\r\nDepends on the following PR:\r\n* https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2105\r\n*
