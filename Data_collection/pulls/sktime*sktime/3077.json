partially addresses #971 by providing a default `get_fitted_params` interface, in `BaseEstimator`.\r\n\r\nBehaviour of `get_fitted_params` is as follows:\r\n\r\n* returns a `dict` with `str` keys, obtained from private `_get_fitted_params` and nested component `get_fitted_params`\r\n* component `get_fitted_params` are indexed by `[componentname]__[paramname]`, in analogy to `get_params`\r\n* raises a `NotFittedError` when called before estimator is fitted.\r\n\r\nDefault behaviour is also implemented:\r\n* `_get_fitted_params` retrievese all attributes ending in `_`, and presents them with keys where the ending `_` is removed\r\n* the default is compatible with the nesting interface\r\n\r\nA test is added to check the expected behaviour.","created_at":"2022-07-23T19:11:22Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T18:23:38Z","closed_at":"2022-07-30T18:23:37Z","merged_at":"2022-07-30T18:23:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0a2a5b407d107c722351f7d43f7fe1fc9bfd3a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
