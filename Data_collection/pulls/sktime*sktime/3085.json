This has been fixed to the correct rule, all inverses are skipped if and only if all elements skip inverses.\r\n* The tag `skip-inverse-transform` was only used in interfacing composites like the `ForecastingPipeline`. This is spreading/decoupling. Instead, the logic to skip was moved to `BaseTransformer`: under the presence of the tag, the `inverse_transform` behaves like the identity transform now.\r\n* All the above connected to a third possible inconsistency in transformers, which had the `capability:inverse_transform` tag set to `False` while `skip-inverse-transform` was set to True, this would lead to contradictory behaviour, between point two (should pass through) and the capability tag behaviour (raised an error). Logic in the `TransformerPipeline` and tests has been reconciled.\r\n* `Aggregator` had the tags set inconsistently and was fixed.\r\n\r\nAdds test case which is a simplified version of #3084.","created_at":"2022-07-24T13:04:38Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T12:49:20Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T12:49:19Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T12:49:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"028350a6372be8a1c597f0f8292d001d7cca8de9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
