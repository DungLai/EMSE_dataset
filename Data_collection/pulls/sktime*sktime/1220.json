Explain your changes.\r\nAutomatically finding best weights for ensemble based on a meta-model (regressor). Weights are taken from\r\neither `regressor.coef_` for all `sklearn` linear models or from `regressor.feature_importances_` for all decision tree-based models.\r\n\r\nI already proved in an example that `AutoEnsembleForecaster` is outperforming each single given forecaster for `load_airline` data, so we know that this ensemble approach can outperform. Code is here to see the error differences:\r\n```python\r\ny = load_airline()\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)\r\nfh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)\r\n\r\n# create ensemble\r\nforecasters = [\r\n    (\"naive\", NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"drift\")),\r\n    (\"ets\", AutoETS(auto=True, n_jobs=-1, sp=12)),\r\n    (\"arima\", AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)),\r\n    (\"bats\", BATS(sp=12, use_trend=True)),\r\n    (\"tbats\", TBATS(sp=12, use_trend=True))\r\n]\r\nauto = AutoEnsembleForecaster(forecasters=forecasters)\r\nauto.fit(y_train, fh=fh)\r\n\r\n# get prediction and weights\r\ny_weighted = auto.predict(fh)\r\nauto.weights_\r\n> [0.0046995889455789235,\r\n> 0.4021907840860222,\r\n> 0.01191944521686898,\r\n> 0.12701615072179243,\r\n> 0.4541740310297374]\r\n\r\n# create benchmark forecasters, same as given to ensemble\r\nforecaster_1 = NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"drift\")\r\nforecaster_2 = AutoETS(auto=True, n_jobs=-1, sp=12)\r\nforecaster_3 = AutoARIMA(suppress_warnings=True)\r\nforecaster_4 = BATS(sp=12, use_trend=True)\r\nforecaster_5 = TBATS(sp=12, use_trend=True)\r\n\r\ny_pred_1 = forecaster_1.fit(y_train).predict(fh)\r\ny_pred_2 = forecaster_2.fit(y_train).predict(fh)\r\ny_pred_3 = forecaster_3.fit(y_train).predict(fh)\r\ny_pred_4 = forecaster_4.fit(y_train).predict(fh)\r\ny_pred_5 = forecaster_5.fit(y_train).predict(fh)\r\n\r\n# get benchmark results\r\nprint(\"naive \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_1))\r\nprint(\"ets \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_2))\r\nprint(\"arima \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_3))\r\nprint(\"bats \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_4))\r\nprint(\"tbats \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_5))\r\nprint(\"ens \\t\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_weighted))\r\n\r\n> naive \t 7695.698285148631\r\n> ets \t 1153.7492147391474\r\n> arima \t 3505.3729027077143\r\n> bats \t 887.3656338724588\r\n> tbats \t 801.3102613074158\r\n> ens \t 584.1444166907737\r\n```\r\nPlot of the forecasts:\r\n![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29627036/127347954-10426913-7d71-443f-a4bc-d99b6157a4b8.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a refactor of `StackingForecaster` and docs.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nAny ideas to improve UX and performance of this class?\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
