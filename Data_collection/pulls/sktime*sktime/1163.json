Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nThis is a draft of the functionality discussed in #958. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThis adds the ability for forecasting performance_metric classes to be able to evaluate the underlying function (without aggregation) on error samples (e.g. each `y_true - y_pred`). \r\n\r\nSignature of the method is `score_samples(y_true, y_pred, **kwargs)`. This implements an interface that builds on the `__call__` signature of the metrics (`y_train` or `y_pred_benchmark` are passed as kwargs) and the discussion in #958. Note that I'm open to having a different name than `score_samples`. I also built on the forecasting module refactor and have the primary logic in `_score_samples`. \r\n\r\nWhen implementing I considered the the ability to leverage the same code as much as possible when calculating the metrics on a sample or the aggregate metrics. To do this I did a mild refactor of `_functions.py` to make the functionality that is needed when evaluating samples and the aggregate metrics portable (e.g. the sample based code is mostly in non-public functions used by the aggregate functions and `_score_samples`). \r\n\r\nNote that I've set it up so that the BaseForecastingMetric will evaluate the metric functions on each sample using np.vectorize. This will only be used when creating a metric via `make_forecasting_metric`. This is not efficient, but it allows the user to only pass the aggregate metric function instead of having to write and pass two functions to `make_forecasting_metric` (i.e.: aggregate metric function and a sample function). I sided with making it easier on users relative to performance in that case. \r\n\r\nFor all the built-in metrics we offer out of the box, they are using individualized implementations that are more efficient. \r\n\r\n \r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
