Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNext step in #1737 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Test SingleWindowSplitter with Timedelta forecasting horizon. That is, add `TEST_FHS_TIMEDELTA` to tests cases in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection.tests.test_split.test_single_window_splitter` and in `sktime.forecasting.model_selection.tests.test_split.test_single_window_splitter_default_window_length`.\r\n\r\n`_get_end` function now returns the value which can be directly used with either `.loc` or `iloc` indexing. For that the value is `-2` relative to the original version. This change makes the function more intuitive. `_get_end` function is used in:\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter._split`. I added 2 to offset the change.\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.BaseWindowSplitter.get_cutoffs`. I added 2 to offset the change.\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.SingleWindowSplitter._split`. I added 1 directly where it is used (now `end = _get_end(y, fh)`) and one more 1 in calculation of integer `start` (now `start = end - window_length + 1`).\r\n- `sktime.forecasting.model_selection._split.SingleWindowSplitter.get_cutoffs`. I have added 2 (now `end = _get_end(y, fh)`).\r\n\r\nNo external changes were made. Tests are the same plus added more test cases for Timedelta forecasting horizons.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [DOC] or [BUG] indicating wether the PR topic is related to enhancement, documentation or
