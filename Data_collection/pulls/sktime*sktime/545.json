Explain your changes.\r\nAllows plot_series to take pred_int (2nd output of model.predict()) as an option variable. If present, plots lower and upper bound confidence intervals for prediction using plt.fill_between. The index of pred_int is also checked to make sure it fits within same axis as existing series. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
