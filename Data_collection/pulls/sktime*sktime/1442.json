Explain your changes.\r\nWhen training an AutoArima you don't know what differencing order it'll land at so if data changes at some point you won't be able to do in sample forecasts for some points (earlier to diff order). This implementation makes predictions possible (without errors) if they're ealier to differencing order.\r\nIt also fixes a small problem with appending out of sample to in sample predictions when intervals are to be returned.\r\n\r\n> #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nif the code is clear enough, if the comments should be left.\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n> ##### For new estimators\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-21T15:18:35Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T17:07:56Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T19:22:13Z","merged_at":"2021-10-01T19:22:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c11e9ad50c49af560534ff1756d58d9f6bc8f0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/cfd8d66fe25ba25b02132d1a05b79b716ff189aa","head":{"label":"IlyasMoutawwakil:pandas_na_for_unpredictible_insample_forecast","ref":"pandas_na_for_unpredictible_insample_forecast","sha":"cfd8d66fe25ba25b02132d1a05b79b716ff189aa","user":{"login":"IlyasMoutawwakil","id":57442720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDQyNzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57442720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil","html_url":"https://github.com/IlyasMoutawwakil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402697774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDI2OTc3NzQ=","name":"sktime","full_name":"IlyasMoutawwakil/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"IlyasMoutawwakil","id":57442720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDQyNzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57442720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil","html_url":"https://github.com/IlyasMoutawwakil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/IlyasMoutawwakil/sktime","description":
