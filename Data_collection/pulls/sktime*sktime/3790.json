Explain your changes.\r\nEnables reconciliation at different temporal aggregation levels, e.g. weekly and daily\r\nThe level created needs to be of a lower sampling frequency. Only one higher level is supported.\r\nSo days can be resampled to weeks but not to weeks and months.\r\nForecasting starts from the last day of the last group, and not the last day.\r\nTo mitigate dates which are removed are placed back.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, airline times are loaded and relabelled to days.\r\nA forecast is created at the weekly level and then converted back to days using historic disaggregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.hierarchical.aggregate import Aggregator\r\nfrom sktime.transformations.series.date import TempAgg\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.reconcile import ReconcilerForecaster\r\nfrom sktime.forecasting.sarimax import SARIMAX\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nweeks = 1\r\nfh = 7*weeks\r\ny = pd.DataFrame(load_airline())\r\ny.index = pd.DatetimeIndex(pd.date_range(y.index.min().to_timestamp(),\r\n                                          periods=len(y)))\r\n# clip it\r\ny=y[:y[y.index.weekday==6].index.max()]\r\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=fh)\r\n\r\nf = TempAgg(freq='W-MON')*Aggregator()*(TempAgg(freq='W-MON')**Aggregator()**ReconcilerForecaster(SARIMAX(), method='td_fcst'))\r\nf.fit(y=y_train, X=y_train)\r\nprds = f.predict(fh=list(range(1, weeks+1)), X=y_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nas suggested by @fkiraly in https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3778\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThere are no tests at the moment. Only supports one level.\r\nForecasts start at date of latest grouping.\r\nIncomplete groups are filters by getting median count.\r\nThis does not work for small datasets.\r\nYou have to ensure that your exogenous data consists out of complete groups.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nI will try to add support for multiple levels by the end of the week.\r\nProbably, going to add support for passing a list and create aggregates by looping over it.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-15T14:05:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T14:05:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53b3ec25ddeb8422dceb4fee5958682c3f2965e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/b828d4c7b9310713d01813196c6d3b3aec4aa094","head":{"label":"RikStarmans:tempagg","ref":"tempagg","sha":"b828d4c7b9310713d01813196c6d3b3aec4aa094","user":{"login":"RikStarmans","id":109525630,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoc6fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans","html_url":"https://github.com/RikStarmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":566347645,"node_id":"R_kgDOIcHHfQ","name":"sktime","full_name":"RikStarmans/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RikStarmans","id":109525630,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoc6fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans","html_url":"https://github.com/RikStarmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RikStarmans/followers","follow
