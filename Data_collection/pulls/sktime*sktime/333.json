Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe extension guidelines: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nRefers to #271 for implementing New Online Ensemble Forecasting Methods\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThis implements hedge based DTOL for choosing how to weight different forecasters in an online format, I included some implementations of these algorithms with more to come:\r\n- NormalHedge\r\n- Hedge (Incremental/Doubling)\r\n\r\nI also included one that is very similar to stacking that performs a non-negative least squares fit from the forecasters to the output.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\nCurrently, the online experts algorithms are included as a script, but as more are added, it would be good to include more in a dedicated repository for online experts.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\nFor the 'OnlineEnsembleForecaster' I have:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n- [x] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's [estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI also added a cv method called 'OnlineSplitter' which helps me control the behavior of update_predict for forecasting in an online fashion.","created_at":"2020-07-06T03:27:44Z","updated_at":"2020-11-07T02:42:50Z","closed_at":"2020-11-06T18:15:57Z","merged_at":"2020-11-06T18:15:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b38328dcb17631e0098bc74960cdf45ce3566637","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180387595,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzg3NTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20algorithms","name":"implementing
