This is based on the design in [STEP no.5](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/tree/main/steps/05_scitype_based_IO_checks), adapted to the new forecasting base class.\r\n\r\nThe key ingredient are:\r\n\r\n* converters parameterized by from, to, and as - in the `convertIO`module. Besides the obvious conversion functionality, the converters can be given access to a dictionary via reference in the `store` argument, where information for inverting lossy conversions (like from `pd.DataFrame` to `np.array`) can be stored\r\n* a new tag `y_type` which encodes the type of `y` that the private `_fit`, `_predict`, and `_update` assume internally - for now, it's just one type and not a list of compatible types\r\n* some logic in the public \"plumbing\" area of `fit`, `predict`, `update`, which converts inputs to the public layer to the desired input of the logic layer and back\r\n\r\nThis is for discussion, and I expect major change before we merge.\r\n\r\nIt might be especially interesting to discuss the following interaction with typing:\r\nthe third argument of the converter, the \"as\" argument, is a scitype, and designed to have the same name as the respective `typing` composite type. Also see discussion in #965, #973 and #974.\r\n\r\nThinking of the logical continuation of this:\r\n\r\n* extend this to the other arguments, e.g., `X`\r\n* the individual argument checks like `check_X` etc should be replaced by checks of the kind `check(what, as : scitype)`, e.g., `check(y, \"Series\")` should replace the less generic `check_y`.\r\n* extend this to time series classification, to support 3D numpy arrays, awkward arrays, nested data frames\r\n\r\nA \"visionary\" pathway may see this working with type annotations that are scitypes, not `typing` machine types, e.g.,\r\n```python\r\nfit(X : Series, Y : Series)\r\netc\r\n_fit(X: Series, Y : UnivariateSeries)\r\n```\r\nand checks/conversions being done automatically.","created_at":"2021-06-19T15:01:46Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T07:33:00Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T07:32:32Z","merged_at":"2021-07-22T07:32:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"5bab347c1ed57dbb8f847743ca51ab6442176ab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ABostrom","id":9571933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzE5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9571933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom","html_url":"https://github.com/ABostrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/26734429948cd9293e349428a3e009527be4020a","head":{"label":"sktime:forecasting-input-output-conv","ref":"forecasting-input-output-conv","sha":"26734429948cd9293e349428a3e009527be4020a","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","h
