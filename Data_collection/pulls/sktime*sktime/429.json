issue #413 \r\n\r\nintroducing the dependence to the tslearn, fixed the test for the KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier that checks in the case the parameter is a callable and the param name is a metric if it is the correct function\r\n\r\nChanged the dtw function from `sktime.distances.elastic_cython` to `from tslearn.metrics import cdist_dtw as dtw_distance`\r\nFixed the test for the KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T15:14:29Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T09:52:33Z","closed_at":"2020-10-14T09:52:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b09a0a26fbe00ab429faa7ebe3777ca725c3fd2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/04c737880b20f48edf1e676a0fd26eb21f5db930","head":{"label":"Abelarm:master","ref":"master","sha":"04c737880b20f48edf1e676a0fd26eb21f5db930","user":{"login":"Abelarm","id":6976921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzY5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6976921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm","html_url":"https://github.com/Abelarm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abelarm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"sktime:master","ref":"master","sha":"ec2c67fa962b27965c6aa115c8aad37cc88b9533","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
