resolves #1025 by providing a comprehensive introduction to the transformers in `sktime`.\r\n\r\nThe introduction currently includes the first chapter which explains the key transformer types, their signature, and how users can search for transformers.\r\n\r\nThe sections with further details are currently WiP, but I think this is good enough as a first pass and helpful to users.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds one fixture for a univariate, positive-valued series, to have an easy example to showcase the `BoxCoxTransformer` (which requires positive values).","created_at":"2021-12-06T00:16:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T00:26:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T00:26:32Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T00:26:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"72f3520e8dba74670a87031b54ba6fe8c1154b1c","assignee":{"login":"danbartl","id":19947407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ3NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19947407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl","html_url":"https://github.com/danbartl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danbartl","id":19947407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ3NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19947407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl","html_url":"https://github.com/danbartl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbartl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"Lovkush-A","id":25344832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQ0ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25344832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A","html_url":"https://github.com/Lovkush-A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lovkush-A/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chrisholder","id":4674372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisholder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisholder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/
