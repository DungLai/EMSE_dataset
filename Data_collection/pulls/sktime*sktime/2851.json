Explain your changes.\r\nI have implemented a Window based change point detection algorithm in the form of an adapter for the ruptures Window class \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nThe contribution creates a new soft dependency as such, pyproject.toml and check_soft_dependencies.py have been updated as well.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nAs there is no template chosen yet for annotation/change point/segmentation I went ahead and chose what I thought was best and was to inherit from BaseSeriesAnnotator class. \r\nI can refactor any changes if needed or if any other template would be better I will make the changes. Suggestions are more than welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [ x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-23T09:01:14Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T22:01:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7ed05b2d7838714644f088cf77a3b41fc151798","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3108854999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA4ODU0OTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:annotation","name":"module:annotation","color":"F1ECF1","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3796180314,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7iRR1a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"fef2c0","default":true,"description":"Adding
