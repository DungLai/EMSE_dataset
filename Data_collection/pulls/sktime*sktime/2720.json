This hence affects `FeatureUnion` through refactoring of the common functionality.\r\n* the type check for `Table` is modified to return a `n_instances` (number of rows/instances) metadata field, for all `Table` mtypes. This is used in the return type check, e.g., to check that `SummaryTransformer.fit_transform` returns the correct number of rows for multivariate input.","created_at":"2022-05-29T14:10:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T21:00:06Z","closed_at":"2022-06-05T21:00:05Z","merged_at":"2022-06-05T21:00:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"a761368f32b12913f2d7c22d87776e6112cc785d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3137622230,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM3NjIyMjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:tests","name":"module:tests","color":"43421D","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2720/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2720/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2720/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/6dfe3d392ff1b5abc53415d7c90f9adb979a5840","head":{"label":"sktime:summarytrafo-mv-fix","ref":"summarytrafo-mv-fix","sha":"6dfe3d392ff1b5abc53415d7c90f9adb979a5840","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","re
