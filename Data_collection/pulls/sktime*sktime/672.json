I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality. \r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss). \r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNot as coded. But several of the functions could be replaced by wrappers on scikit-learn functions. However, this would require changing the scikit-learn dependency to be >=0.24 which might be unneeded. \r\n\r\nAs coded, I use their code (need to ensure I have references to the places I do that) to avoid the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nLet me know if the naming convention changes to the forecasting metrics makes sense. To me it makes sense to keep this as aligned with scikit-learn's metrics. \r\n\r\nNote that I also added a few tweaks in the validation functions to support the ability to validate the input data to these functions. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-11T22:22:25Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T13:00:39Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T13:00:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b9fa7f7f8a45ad7243e85dcbdd8fb8721c83930","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/c1453c4ba5abdf86bdd84df00387788f539e546c","head":{"label":"RNKuhns:master","ref":"master","sha":"c1453c4ba5abdf86bdd84df00387788f539e546c","user":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321519701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE1MTk3MDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"RNKuhns/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns/sktime","description":"A
