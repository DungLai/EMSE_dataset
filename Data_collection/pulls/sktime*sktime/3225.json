#3221.\r\n\r\nThere were two problems with the dynamic metric after refactoring:\r\n\r\n* `lower_is_better` tag was only set if false\r\n* `func` attribute was not properly written or invoked\r\n\r\nFurther bugs in the metrics base classes were discovered in the process of fixing:\r\n\r\n* the `BaseForecastingMetric` did not call `super.__init__` in its `__init__`, breaking dynamic tag functionality\r\n* the `BaseForecastingMetric` would overwrite `self.name` even if it was set by a child class already, leading to potential `sklearn` incompatibility (parameter get/set)\r\n\r\nThe bug was also not caught since the dynamic metric started with an underscore, so was not collected in tests.\r\nThis has been remedied by adding to tests:\r\n\r\n* a version of the example in #3221\r\n* the custom metric from #3221 as test parameters for the dynamic metric\r\n* a full run of `check_estimator` on the resulting metric","created_at":"2022-08-09T15:57:23Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T22:07:56Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T22:07:56Z","merged_at":"2022-08-10T22:07:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b5c3f4f4f80d9c2e1c3372c2944d2925b2a1fd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
