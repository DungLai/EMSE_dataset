This is unexpected, since the transformer ignores `y`.\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic in a `TransformedTargetPipeline` since there the forecaster's `X` - typically multivariate - is passed to the `y` of the transformers. (slightly surprising to me, but that's the status quo).\r\n\r\nThis implements a quick workaround, where the inner mtype for the `BoxCoxtransformer` is set to multivariate, that doesn't cause an error if a multivariate one is passed.\r\n\r\nNo other transformers are impacted currently, since `BoxCoxTransformer` is the only one refactored so far.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to think about how to fix this in the future. Options:\r\n* assume multivariate `y` by default, this will do a silent input conversion (which may be superfluous but won't cause an error)\r\n* introduce a tag on whether `y` is used internally, and in that case do not do a conversion at all (seems cleaner but introduces a new tag)","created_at":"2021-12-08T17:58:00Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T22:00:32Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T22:00:32Z","merged_at":"2021-12-08T22:00:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"af70793c45c821a72d9104088181769370eb18c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1118163262,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTE4MTYzMjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
