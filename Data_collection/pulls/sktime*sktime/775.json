Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n Prediction intervals for NaiveForecaster #480\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nImplement for #480 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. New function under naive.py NaiveForecaster\r\n2. Edit for _predict under _BaseWindowForecaster in _sktime.py (To return the results)\r\n3. New unit testing for Naive forecaster pred intervals (Currently failing need to add expected prediction intervals to fix)\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] _predict_intervals in naive.py \r\n- [ ] _predict in _BaseWindowForecaster\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\nPlease suggest a package to calculate multiplier(C) in _predict_intervals or in a commit I'll do it with the equation or with another package.\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [X] Added a unit test, currently failing, needs the expected predict intervals for the function.\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-03T19:03:00Z","updated_at":"2021-12-04T15:59:35Z","closed_at":"2021-12-04T15:59:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfa90f5b75266f93ddb20706b03f2192182f4cd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/3f35a0ee407d9fddf2388b3bce306c75a6cf47c4","head":{"label":"senu-nk:naive_forecaster_pred_intervals","ref":"naive_forecaster_pred_intervals","sha":"3f35a0ee407d9fddf2388b3bce306c75a6cf47c4","user":{"login":"senu-nk","id":43887812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODg3ODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43887812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk","html_url":"https://github.com/senu-nk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senu-nk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"sktime:main","ref":"main","sha":"465d6193b0dc1797e40b9e30cba34e2cb2b83d2f","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
