Explain your changes.\r\n* Adds 3d numpy arrays as supported input types for the series-as-features setting (classification, regression, etc) via `coerce_numpy` and `coerce_pandas` kwarg in input validation functions, so estimators can decide internally which representation to use and which representation to return (transformers)\r\n* Changes to algorithms to directly handle numpy input, otherwise added `coerce_to_pandas` flag to input checks\r\n* Added tests for 3d numpy input to all series-as-feature estimators, including classifiers, regressors and transformers \r\n\r\n#### Additional changes\r\n* Adds `sktime.classification.all` and `sktime.regression.all` for easy importing\r\n* Deprecates `tabularize` in favour of `from_nested_to_2d_numpy` for consistency\r\n* Bug fix in `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` to achieve random state consistency\r\n* Handling of empty results in unit tests to fix flaky tests for `TSFreshRelevantFeatureExtractor`\r\n* Added decorator for raising deprecation warning\r\n* Added unit tests for unit test framework \r\n* Minor formatting changes\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-30T11:48:58Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T08:24:07Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T08:24:06Z","merged_at":"2020-10-07T08:24:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6f17bd586df6bbc8e6c783f08eda4c30d2353f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
