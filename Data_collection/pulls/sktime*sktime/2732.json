That assumes that all parameters in the class constructors are explicitly named keyword arguments, and parameters exposed by the `scikit-learn` parameter interface are precisely the named keyword arguments. Passing parameters via unnamed keyword arguments is not caught by the parameter inspection and setter interface of `scikit-learn` or `sktime`. So far, this has been possible without setting off a test, and could lead to unexpected and buggy behaviour, as #2730 shows.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix #2731 for #2730 is merged, this correctly catches out `ARIMA` as non-compliant.\r\n\r\nRelies on the fixes in #2773, of #2733, to test that these are indeed fixes.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-01T12:06:17Z","updated_at":"2022-06-12T14:18:04Z","closed_at":"2022-06-11T17:43:24Z","merged_at":"2022-06-11T17:43:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d07a2e02518a1e5740994693281914ce94a4fe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1631667223,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMxNjY3MjIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/maintenance","name":"maintenance","color":"ea761e","default":false,"description":"Continuous
