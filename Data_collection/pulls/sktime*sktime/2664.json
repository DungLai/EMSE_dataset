See #2157 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- The new g matrix function for top down - `_get_g_matrix_td_fcst()`\r\n- An update function for the g matrix for this method, which changes for each forecast - `_update_td_fcst()`\r\n- A function for returning a parent/child look up table for all methods - `_parent_child_df()`\r\n- Re-format of the `_transform()` function to incorporate the new method, also uses column/index matching with `df.dot()` now\r\n- Improvements to documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
