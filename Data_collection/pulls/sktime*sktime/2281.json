It should have said `coverage = abs(1 - 2 * a)` but it said sth completely different. Not sure how that happened.\r\n* `BaseForecaster`'s default conversion of `predict_interval` to `predict_quantiles` could break on occasion when two (float/numerically) identical coverages were produced, due to non-unique indexing. This should be fixed now.\r\n* `ARIMA.predict_interval` was passing `coverage` as `alpha`, where `alpha` in `ARIMA` is in fact `1-coverage`. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\nSo, all should now hopefully be consistent. The example in #2275 now seems to return consistent results.\r\n\r\nAdding this to must haves for 0.11.0 since this seems quite critical (most `predict_quantiles` functions are broken, and `predict_interval` from `pmdarima`).","created_at":"2022-03-23T00:05:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T09:25:23Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T09:25:22Z","merged_at":"2022-03-23T09:25:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c1cf81899bb40074c7e7c917c7a2f9292801b4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1118163262,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTE4MTYzMjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
