PR adds a default `get_params`/`set_params` for the `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` with varying part based on a private attribute, which can replace many of the copy/pasted `get_params`/`set_params` for concrete heterogeneous estimators.\r\n\r\nThis replaces abstract methods of the same name that raise an error if called.\r\n\r\nFor this to work as a replacement of copy-pasted methods in descendants, two changes are made:\r\n\r\n* `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` no longer inherits from `BaseEstimator`, so is turned back into a mixin from a base class\r\n* descendants now must inherit from `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator` *before* a base class\r\n\r\nA full refactor is carried out to replace duplicated `get_params`/`set_params` with the default from `_HeterogenousMetaEstimator`.\r\n\r\nNo deprecation is necessary since the class is private, and the public interfaces do not change.\r\n\r\nTesting is via the main test suite's existing tests for the params interface points.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a bugfix to #3789, as pointed out by @hoesler, with the attribute accessed in `FeatureUnion` changed from `transformer_list` to `_transformer_list`.\r\n\r\nThe bugfix is certified by the test in
