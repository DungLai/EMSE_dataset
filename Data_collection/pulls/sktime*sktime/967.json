Explain your changes.\r\nForecastingPipeline for pipelining with exog data\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n1. Inheritance from new class `_Pipeline`\r\n2. There is an issue to use the `ForecastingPipeline` just for the purpose of a transformer pipeline, bcz in the transformer interface, we allow in `transform(Z, X)` that `Z` can be a `pd.DataFrame` but in the `fit(y, X)` function `y` must be a `pd.Series`. Solutions for this which I have considered:\r\n    1)  It would only be allowed to use `ForecastingPipeline` as a transformer pipeline if `y` and `X` are given like `fit_transform(y, X)`. This is the status when I open this PR.\r\n    2)  We could add an if-statement in `fit()` to catch cases where `y` is a `pd.DataFrame`, however this would be an impact to the interface that we allow `y` to be a `pd.DataFrame` which is never the case so far. \r\n    3) We dont implement `transform()` for `ForecastingPipeline`\r\n\r\nGeneral question of using `ForecastingPipeline` or `TranformedTargetForecaster` as a transformer pipeline: when calling `fit_transform`, the `fit` and `transform` functions are called and this means that also the given `forecaster` is fitted. So also a forecaster has to be given, but we might want to allow `forecaster=None`. This might probably best be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
