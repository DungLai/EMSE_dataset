Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the [UnobservedComponents](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.structural.UnobservedComponents.html) from statsmodels. We follow closely the existing implementation [sktime/forecasting/ets.py](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/ets.py) using the [` _StatsModelsAdapter`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/sktime/forecasting/base/adapters/_statsmodels.py) class (a minor change was added in order to support `exog` variables).\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nIn this initial PR I provide a basic implementation of the wrapper. Still, I wanna make sure I understand what are the requirements the code needs in order to merge to `main`. Concretely here are my questions:\r\n\r\n**Main Questions:**\r\n\r\n- The docstrings of the original statsmodels class [UnobservedComponents](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.structural.UnobservedComponents.html) is very complete and gives a clear description of the model and the `level` variable which determines the structure of the state space model. How much should I add to the doctrings on the `sktime` implementation?\r\n\r\n- Which kind of  test should I write? Probably a couple of test ensuring the statsmodels implementation agrees with this one.\r\n\r\n- Should I add this model to the [`examples/01_forecasting.ipynb`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/01_forecasting.ipynb) notebook? Any other place where I should add more examples on this new estimator?\r\n\r\n- Any other feedback or suggestion?\r\n\r\n**Minor Questions**\r\n\r\n- I wanted to add some useful plotting functions to this wrapper. Unfortunately the simple method `plot_components` fils because a `TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'Period'`. Have you encounter this type of error in the past? It seems the internal plotting functions do not handle `Period` types.\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added complete doc-strings.\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.","created_at":"2021-09-06T10:58:04Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T12:37:53Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T12:37:53Z","merged_at":"2021-09-17T12:37:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd7515f2443efeddebb739ad7c41284aceb5894b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/milestones/7/labels","id":7119752,"node_id":"MI_kwDOCVKAsc4AbKOI","number":7,"title":"v0.8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":17,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-03T12:48:05Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T19:56:36Z","due_on":"2021-09-17T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T19:56:36Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/c90102d3278c39fad230bfc9b7034a59260c73b7","head":{"label":"juanitorduz:unobserved_components","ref":"unobserved_components","sha":"c90102d3278c39fad230bfc9b7034a59260c73b7","user":{"login":"juanitorduz","id":22996444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTk2NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22996444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz","html_url":"https://github.com/juanitorduz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanitorduz/rece
