This does not yet contain defaults in terms of `_predict_proba`, since we have not settled on output format yet.\r\n\r\nIt is partly based on work in @k1m190r's PR #1842 and @kejsitake in #1579, behaviour moved to base class default implementations.\r\n\r\nBehaviour implemented:\r\n* if `_predict_interval`  is not implemented but `_predict_quantiles` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* if `_predict_quantiles`  is not implemented but `_predict_interval` is, it is called and outputs are reformatted\r\n* the check whether sth is implemented is done by a utility added to `BaseObject`, a method `_has_implementation_of`, which is based on @k1m190r's utility that checks whether the forecaster has been refactored, which was based on @kejsitake's and some discussion between the three of us.\r\n\r\nFurther, the following forecasters were relying primarily on `_predict_quantiles` but interfacing interval prediction logic. This has been changed by tidying up the interface, implementing a leaner `_predict_interval`, and removing `_predict_quantiles`:\r\n* `_PmdArimaAdapter`\r\n* `_TbatsAdapter`\r\n* `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n\r\nAdditional, minor changes:\r\n* docstring fixes in `BaseForecaster`\r\n* multiple minor instances of clean-up in the forecasting extension template\r\n* shortened `ThetaForecaster` internals\r\n* fix for bug in `ThetaForecaster`, where intervals were computed for 1-coverage, not coverage. Same in test for `ThetaForecaster`.\r\n* fix for bug #1954 in `_ProphetAdapter`\r\n* renamed `test_predict_pred_interval` to `test_predict_interval` for consistency with `test_predict_quantiles`","created_at":"2022-01-15T00:08:23Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T22:01:07Z","closed_at":"2022-01-29T21:37:17Z","merged_at":"2022-01-29T21:37:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f493ecd10cdba7faedf54023cf92d91cd37bdfb","assignee":{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/3abf6a621500b316effcae612ef0efed6761c7fc","head":{"label":"sktime:predict_proba_defaults","ref":"predict_proba_defaults","sha":"3abf6a621500b316effcae612ef0efed6761c7fc","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/skti
