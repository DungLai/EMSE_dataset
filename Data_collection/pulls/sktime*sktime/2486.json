refactoring adjustments for the `make_reduction` changes\r\n\r\nMain point is to remove the rather clumsy checks date checks\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            if isinstance(self.cutoff, pd._libs.tslibs.period.Period):\r\n                dateline = pd.period_range(\r\n                    end=fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1], periods=fh_max\r\n                )\r\n            elif isinstance(self.cutoff, np.int64) or isinstance(self.cutoff, int):\r\n                dateline = list(\r\n                    range(self.cutoff + 1, fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1] + 1)\r\n                )\r\n            else:\r\n                dateline = pd.date_range(\r\n                    end=fh.to_absolute(self.cutoff)[-1], periods=fh_max\r\n                )\r\n            y_pred = _create_multiindex(dateline, self._y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a helper function that draws on the fh functions\r\n\r\n```python\r\n index_range = _index_range(relative, self.cutoff)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso reworked the `create_multiindex` function to for compatibility with hierarchical formats.\r\n\r\nThe key step is \r\n\r\n```\r\n    mi = (\r\n        target_frame.groupby(x_names, as_index=True)\r\n        .apply(\r\n            lambda df: df.drop(x_names, axis=1)\r\n            .set_index(time_names)\r\n            .asfreq(freq_inferred)\r\n        )\r\n        .index\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat supports now to have the hierarchical format also for global forecasting\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2628\r\nhttps://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2615","created_at":"2022-04-15T13:17:46Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T16:45:18Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T16:45:18Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T16:45:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"563282e64196aba559e212f03651b54bd7b56dac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"patrickzib","id":7783034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickzib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ABostrom","id":9571933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzE5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9571933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom","html_url":"https://github.com/ABostrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":
