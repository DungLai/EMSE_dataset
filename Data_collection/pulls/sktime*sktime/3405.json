PR introduces missing data input checks to forecasters and fixes #3402.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* `_check_X_y` in forecasters now raises an informative exception if input contains missing data and the forecaster does not support it\r\n* the forecaster extension template is updated accordingly\r\n* reducers are updated so missing value handling tags mirror the wrapped sklearn estimator's tag\r\n* switched the tag to `True` in some estimators causing issues:
