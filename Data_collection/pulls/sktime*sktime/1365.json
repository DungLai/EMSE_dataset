If it's a panel-to-sth transformer, a series is interpreted as a one-instance-panel.\r\n* to enable this, the arguments need to change to be the same - `Z` will be deprecated in favour of `X` which anyway seems to be the key user expectation here; currently an input handler ensures that `Z` is treated as an alias for `X` in general\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a first stab at:\r\n* checking and conversion logic\r\n* logic related to the panel/series treatment in one, single interface\r\n\r\nAs an example, I've also moved `BoxCoxTransformer` to the new interface:\r\n* all that had to be done was changing `fit` to `_fit` etc, and populate the `X_inner_mtype` tag correctly\r\n* due to the panel/series logic, this now also works out-of-the box for all the supported panel mtypes including `df-multiindex` which is used for hierarchical time series as well\r\n\r\nReviewers should focus on:\r\n* the new transformers base class in `base.py`, especially the input handling logic\r\n* the refactored `BoxCoxTransformer`, an example how a `SeriesToSeriesTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n* the refactored `SignatureTransformer`, an example how a `PanelToTabularTransformer` looks after the refactor\r\n\r\nMinor changes needed to make the refactor work:\r\n* conversion functionality from `Series` to `Panel` (one-instance) in `datatypes._series_as_panel`\r\n* conversion from `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` from and to `df-list` (in `datatypes._panel._convert`), since the former is used a lot in tests\r\n* added check in `check_is` for `pd.Dataframe` mtype for `Series` scitype for columns not of `object` dtype, since current check could not distinguish that and the `Panel` mtype `nested_univ` (both were `pd.DataFrame` type)\r\n* PR #1368, which fixes an issue with `TrendForecaster` where it breaks if an `X` is passed. I've made a separate PR since it's a bug that's not related to transformers, just prevents proper fixing of another bug in the current transformer interface.\r\n* `fit_transform` is changed to `fit(X, y).transform(X, y)` from `fit(X, y).transform(X)` which I think was an oversight. Since many tests use `TrendForecaster`, the above change #1368 has to be done first.\r\n* changes to the signature transformers to address the interface inconsistency reported in #1369\r\n* relaxing `np.ndarray` mtype for `Series` so 1D numpy arrays are also allowed (and considered univariate series or vector). This is required since some tests use univariate numpy arrays as label vectors.\r\n* `ForecastingPipeline` was accidentally referring to `y` as `X` in one instance, this was fixed","created_at":"2021-08-30T19:27:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-26T01:18:13Z","closed_at":"2021-11-26T01:18:13Z","merged_at":"2021-11-26T01:18:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9a3935901f764e25784b78355bfb87d104254dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ABostrom","id":9571933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzE5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9571933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom","html_url":"https://github.com/ABostrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ABostrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementi
