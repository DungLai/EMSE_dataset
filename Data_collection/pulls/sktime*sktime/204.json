I can add a separate sktime classifier class to link the transform and the sklearn classifier.\r\n* This implementation can handle univaraite and multivariate time series, but not (yet) variable-length time series directly.\r\n* As ROCKET relies on Numba, and Numba only understands NumPy (not pandas), this code uses an unavoidable 'hack', in that the input DataFrame is (and must be) converted into a NumPy array internally.  (Almost certainly, this conversion will break for variable-length time series.)\r\n* The implementation is preliminary, in particular in relation to multivariate time series, which we are still investigating.\r\n* This should produce equivalent results (including timings) to our current published implementation (it is fundamentally very similar), but I have not yet tested this extensively.","created_at":"2019-12-02T13:12:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T09:14:32Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T09:14:32Z","merged_at":"2020-03-13T09:14:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"edee5dc5f49fe8ab669aaa4f02a4382ccd1ff2e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180387595,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzg3NTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20algorithms","name":"implementing
