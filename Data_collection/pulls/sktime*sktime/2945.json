PR attempts to fix grid/random search issues in #2943, #2944.\r\n\r\nA refactor is carried out that replaces manual delegation with `_DelegatedForecaster` inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe problem was likely coming from patching through underscore methods `_fit` etc rather than non-underscore methods such as  `_DelegatedForecaster`.\r\n\r\nAdds the failure cases from #2943, #2944 for testing.","created_at":"2022-07-07T00:26:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T21:05:26Z","closed_at":"2022-07-12T21:05:25Z","merged_at":"2022-07-12T21:05:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"d361b1e48c7eb807a9e4c90126f286f2a2284c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
