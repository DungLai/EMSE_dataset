classifiers in the classification module are just \"special names\" for simple [transformer][classifier] pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR in an intended refactor of the classification module to expose those \"special classifier pipeliens\" as shorthand delegates for said pipelines, in the form of `ClassifierPipeline`.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n* adds `_DelegatedClassifier`, similar to `_DelegatedForecaster` and `_DelegatedTransformer`\r\n* refactors `RocketClassifier` as a specific `_DelegatedClassifier`\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\ndocstrings in the extension template for classifier seemed out of date, these were fixed.\r\n\r\nRelies on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3104 which fixes unreported bugs in `predict_proba` defaulting of classifiers that this has uncovered.\r\n\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/767\r\n(was going through old PRs and seeing what could be done easily)\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2603\r\n(on delegator design - I notice the delegator class for regression/classification could be identical, if it weren't for docstrings!)\r\n\r\nFYI @MatthewMiddlehurst, @victordremov (re `RocketClassifier`) and @miraep8 (re
