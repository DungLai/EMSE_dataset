This PR integrates MultiRocket and MultiRocketMultivariate as transformers and MultiRocketClassifier as well as MultiRocketMultivariateClassifier as classifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nI have restructured @ChangWeiTan MultiRocket (https://github.com/ChangWeiTan/MultiRocket) for sktime interfaces. I redesigned the source code into a transformer and a classifier. In the original source code, there was also a part of the preprocessing (transformer) in the classifier itself. The number of features here refers to the total number of features. In the original source code, the total number of features is only used in the classifier. This is analogous to MiniRocket, but there the number of kernels=number of features. Therefore, I have chosen the number of features as input for the classifier and the transformer. The total number of kernels is then calculated internally (num_kernels_total). num_features=50_000 corresponds approximate to MiniRocket (num_features=10_000) with the corresponding 4 additional features per kernel.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo, no further dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThe reviewer should check if the interfaces are correct and if the variables are named correctly.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\nMultiRocket works similar to Rocket or MiniRocket. Therefore no new examples are required.","created_at":"2021-10-30T18:14:01Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T12:36:12Z","closed_at":"2021-11-23T12:36:12Z","merged_at":"2021-11-23T12:36:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"b87d6a606139f02931b68386e46897e67639d843","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3102418261,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTAyNDE4MjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:classification","name":"module:classification","color":"BEB114","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/dc2569b5ea7d136287f338bf757981b6ac02ad71","head":{"label":"fstinner:Integrate_MultiRocket","ref":"Integrate_MultiRocket","sha":"dc2569b5ea7d136287f338bf757981b6ac02ad71","user":{"login":"fstinner","id":11679462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjc5NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11679462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner","html_url":"https://github.com/fstinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":422836864,"node_id":"R_kgDOGTP6gA","name":"sktime","full_name":"fstinner/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fstinner","id":11679462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjc5NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11679462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner","html_url":"https://github.com/fstinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fstinner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fstinner/sktime","description":"A
