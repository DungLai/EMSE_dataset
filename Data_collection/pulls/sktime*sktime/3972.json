Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nStatsmodels with exogenous features would raise an exception in `predict` if `X` contained more indices than the range of `fh`.\r\nThis was due to all indices being passed through to `statsmodels` `predict`.  The fix ensures that only the expected `X` indices from the test set are passed to `statsmodels` `predict`.\r\n\r\nFixes #3830 as this was also the root cause of the exception raised when using `evaluate` with `statsmodels` based estimators.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
