See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNext small step in #1737.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMy grand plan is to generalize splitters to accept more argument types in splitters. Along the way I realized that there are too many possible combinations of input parameters to treat at the same time. So, a better strategy would be to generalize in very small steps. In this PR I simply raise a `TypeError` if input arguments are either not all ints (as before I started working on #1737), or not all timedelta/dateoffset. I do this check immediately at the initialization of splitter objects. Tests are added to check that the exception is risen.\r\n\r\nNote that I have also replaced `TEST_WINDOW_LENGTHS` (includes ints and timedeltas) with `TEST_WINDOW_LENGTHS_INT` (only ints) in `sktime.forecasting.tests.test_all_forecasters.TestAllForecasters.test_update_predict_predicted_index` to restore the original set of tests existed before the work on #1737 has started.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
