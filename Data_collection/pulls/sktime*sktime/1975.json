Fixes #1435. Fixes #1876. \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nWithin the forecasting horizon methods `to_relative` and `to_absolute_int` coerces absolute and cutoff to the same type to avoid an error that can occur in `pandas` where time differences are multiplied by the frequency multiple (i.e. 2H multiplies the difference by 2). This caused numerous index errors.\r\n\r\n #### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nWhether forcing the type of the input to change could have unintended
