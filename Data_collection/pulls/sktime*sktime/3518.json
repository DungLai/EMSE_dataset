These had a lot of duplicative code as they never underwent the refactor by @achieveordie. This has been addressed by refactoring the existing versions to have the additional argument\r\n* there was also tests in the file `test_single_problem_loaders` which did not exist in the main repository - in fact, the `single_problem_loaders` were not tested in the main repo. The tests were moved to the main repo. They were also refactored, a lot of manual loops were replaced by `pytest.mark.parametrize`. These tests now cover the new argument `return_mtype` in the main module.\r\n* docstrings were also corrected in the data loaders in the main module.","created_at":"2022-10-01T19:53:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T13:30:50Z","closed_at":"2022-10-07T13:30:49Z","merged_at":"2022-10-07T13:30:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"362fb3c91499d6cb953fa951841059926cb8f6e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1631667223,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMxNjY3MjIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/maintenance","name":"maintenance","color":"ea761e","default":false,"description":"Continuous
