At a high level the plan is o have a simple base class that interfaces with the `BaseAnnotator` class and provides interface compatibility.  Then each HMM-like class which inherits from this base class simply imports the relevant HMM estimator from `hmmlearn`. \r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n- make sure parameter setting is consistent/works!\r\n- add some more tests that things work as expected.
