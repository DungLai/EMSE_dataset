This object is then returned.\r\n* post-PR, it first checks whether the argument is a class or an object. If an object, it just returns the argument; if a class, it proceeds as pre-PR.\r\n\r\nSince `_construct_instance` is called at the start of every estimator related test, this change enables all those tests to take objects as well as classes.\r\n\r\nFor the user, this allows convenient command line testing of newly written estimators without first having to deposit default parameters in the default parameter registry, or changing the registry file to test with different parameter settings.","created_at":"2021-06-28T09:12:24Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T23:04:12Z","closed_at":"2021-12-04T16:30:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ea07a6dc9312990e39244c17a627b34aa060314","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1631667223,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMxNjY3MjIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/maintenance","name":"maintenance","color":"ea761e","default":false,"description":"Continuous
