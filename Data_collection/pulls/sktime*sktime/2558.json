Without any additional changes, the \"within test\" variant fails, i.e., the `estimator_instance` fixture retains state changes across runs of the same test. This needed to be addressed in `TestAllEstimator` and `check_estimator`, which had similar but slightly different logic to pass fixtures to the tests.\r\n* the issue is addressed in `TestAllEstimator` by making the `estimator_instance` fixture indirect, and creating a new instance of `estimator_instance` (via `clone`) via the `pytest.fixture` and \"indirect fixture\" formalism. A class variable is added to `TestAllEstimator`, usable by descendants, to indicate which fixtures are indirect.\r\n* the issue is addressed in `check_estimator` by making a `deepcopy` before arguments are passed on to tests. This also seems to speed up the `check_estimator` runtime and tests considerably.\r\n\r\nFurther changes:\r\n* docstring changes to uniformize occurrences of \"parametrize\" and \"parameterize\"\r\n* a `deepcopy_fixtuers` argument in `create_conditional_fixtures_and_names` which allows finer control on whether returned fixtures are reference identical or not. The default is set to `False`, i.e., fixtures are returned reference identical, since now the testing machinery makes the clones/copies, per test run.","created_at":"2022-04-26T23:59:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T18:16:12Z","closed_at":"2022-05-13T18:09:03Z","merged_at":"2022-05-13T18:09:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f35422260cb6fd5cdd8568c11ba15c6bb2a2212","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3137622230,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM3NjIyMjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:tests","name":"module:tests","color":"43421D","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
