Following STEP 12 and discussion in #984\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n* add todo's for what needs to be deprecated/where deprecation warnings will be needed\r\n* have everything that is supposed to be deprecated in `predict()` in an additional else statement\r\n* add abstract method with signature `predict_interval(self, fh=None, X=None, alpha=Union[float, np.ndarray[float, dim=1]]) -> pd.DataFrame` \r\n* make `predict()` call `predict_interval()` unless the boolean flag of `old_predict_interval_logic` is set to true\r\n* move methods related to prediction intervals that are specific to one particular forecaster to that forecaster, for now -> We can further refactor them there\r\n\t* more specifically: move `_get_pred_int` to `_tbats`; move `compute_pred_int` to `theta`, completly delete `_get_pred_int` and directly call `_compute_pred_err()` instead. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should the reviewers concentrate their feedback on\r\n* I think I followed precisely what is suggested in STEP 12, except for this one: \r\n       * STEP 12 suggests moving `_get_pred_int` to theta, but I think it should be safe to completely delete it.\r\n       \r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- `predict()` now contains code duplicates but I thought it would be good for readability to have everything that is going to be deprecated in one else statement such that it can easily be deleted.\r\n- As the next step I think we need to follow through with these changes in the inheriting classes before we can add the deprecation warning. But before implementing `_predict_interval()` in the inheriting classes, we should probably decide how the user can decide on the strategy for computing prediction intervals (either `PredIntervalAdder` or just as arguments in the constructor, see discussion about this in #984). \r\n\r\npinging @fkiraly and @mloning
