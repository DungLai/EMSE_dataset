Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nResolves #325 for `tsfresh`, `pmdarima`, `scikit_posthocs`. If there are more, please let me know as I'm only just starting on `sktime`. Also references #407\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Adds try/except wrappers around soft dependencies. Example:  \r\n```py\r\n# import inside method to avoid hard dependency\r\ntry:\r\n    from pmdarima.arima import AutoARIMA as _AutoARIMA\r\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError as e:\r\n    raise Exception(\r\n        f\"{e}, please run `pip install pmdarima` to install pmdarima\"\r\n    ) from e\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Adds extra_requirements to setup_package()\r\n  * Note again it was only for ones I have been exposed to so far. If there are more, please let me know\r\n  * I took a best guess at what to name the optional features. Please review and let me know\r\n  * To install a soft dependency, run `pip install .[<soft dep, e.g. auto_ARIMA>]`\r\n\r\n* General house cleaning with pre-commit on changed files\r\n  * I would suggest running pre-commit over the entire repo, however it may break many open PRs\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf this is an accepted solution to #325, I'm happy to update the docs with using `extras_require` in `setup.py`\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-01T23:13:54Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T22:45:22Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T15:02:40Z","merged_at":"2020-10-05T15:02:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0b2058c95f7131986e57bac1f8764d135a7059f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/318ca0ca7e07273c5c17b266ec9b7f0852f9c6d4","head":{"label":"alwinw:opt-dep","ref":"opt-dep","sha":"318ca0ca7e07273c5c17b266ec9b7f0852f9c6d4","user":{"login":"alwinw","id":16846521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ2NTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16846521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw","html_url":"https://github.com/alwinw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":300081308,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDAwODEzMDg=","name":"sktime","full_name":"alwinw/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alwinw","id":16846521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ2NTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16846521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw","html_url":"https://github.com/alwinw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alwinw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alwinw/sktime","description":"A
