Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a warning for macOS users using ARM macs of the issues that they may encounter when installing ``all_extras``, related to some dependencies not compatible with that kind of setup.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nThis contribution does not add any new dependency.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nCheck if the warning is enough, or it would be appropriate to add a link to a separate new article in the documentation explaining in more detail the issue, listing the dependencies that cause the error, in case the user wants to install all the other dependencies in ``all_extras`` that do not generate any errors.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of
