See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nRelated to #2091. Starting with a Univariate Forecaster.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAdding a Mock Forecaster for use in debugging and testing. \r\nThe Forecaster will log all the methods called and their parameters.\r\n[Edit]: I added a new function `make_mock_estimator` that makes any estimator log all the methods that are called along with their inputs.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sktime.datasets import load_airline\r\nfrom sktime.utils.estimators import MockUnivariateForecaster\r\nforecaster = MockUnivariateForecaster()\r\ny = load_airline()\r\nforecaster.fit(y.iloc[:5])\r\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(fh=[1,2,3])\r\ny_pred_quantiles = forecaster.predict_quantiles(fh=[1,2,3], alpha=[0.1, 0.9])\r\nforecaster.update(y.iloc[5:10])\r\npprint(forecaster.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput: \r\n```python\r\n[('_fit',\r\n  {'X': None,\r\n   'fh': None,\r\n   'y': Period\r\n1949-01    112.0\r\n1949-02    118.0\r\n1949-03    132.0\r\n1949-04    129.0\r\n1949-05    121.0\r\nFreq: M, Name: Number of airline passengers, dtype: float64}),\r\n ('_predict',\r\n  {'X': None,\r\n   'fh': ForecastingHorizon([1, 2, 3], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)}),\r\n ('_predict_quantiles',\r\n  {'X': None,\r\n   'alpha': [0.1, 0.9],\r\n   'fh': ForecastingHorizon([1, 2, 3], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)}),\r\n ('_update',\r\n  {'X': None,\r\n   'update_params': True,\r\n   'y': Period\r\n1949-06    135.0\r\n1949-07    148.0\r\n1949-08    148.0\r\n1949-09    136.0\r\n1949-10    119.0\r\nFreq: M, Name: Number of airline passengers, dtype: float64})]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n- The tests for the `make_mock_estimator` are a bit lazy. Suggestions on how to make them better are welcome! But bear in mind we don't want to make them too dependent on the private interface etc.\r\n- Is Mock the right naming here? Maybe we can call it `LoggingForecaster` / `make_logging_estimator`\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
