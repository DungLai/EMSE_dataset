Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem that docstrings of the class `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` from `sktime.classification.frequency_based._rise.py` are incompatible with Sphinx, including the bib reference and code block. \r\n\r\nI have fixed it based on the docstrings of `TimeSeriesForestClassifier`. Before the modification, the docstring of `RandomIntervalSpectralForest` is:\r\n\r\n![prev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22359569/98440471-e12fff80-2133-11eb-80ef-42bede4f565f.png)\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBelow is the result after running `make.bat` locally on the modified docstrings:\r\n![now](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22359569/98440809-e1c99580-2135-11eb-8634-86d32cb55059.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for
