Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR proposing a design for a more flexible \"network\" pipeline. The general idea of this network pipeline is that the steps comprising the pipeline are not chained, i.e. the output of a step is not necessarily the input for the next step. Instead, the output of any step can serve as input to any other step in the pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe steps of the pipeline are specified as tuple following the convention below:\r\n```python\r\n('step_name', Algorithm, arguments)\r\n```\r\n`step_name` is a string with the name of the step\r\n`Algorithm` can be `sktime.transformations.base.BaseTransformer` or `sktime.base.BaseEstimator`.\r\n`arguments` is a dictionary that is substituted in the `fit`, `fit_transform` or `predict` method of the step.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can use the following key words: `original_X` and `original_y` which refer to the `X` and `y` arguments of  `NetworkPipeline.fit` and `NetworkPipeline.predcit` methods.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can refer to the output of any step of the pipeline by the name of the step.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` dictionary can specify different arguments for `NetworkPipeline.fit` or `NetworkPipeline.predict`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Forecasting example. Note convention for specifying different arguments \r\n# depending on whether NetworkPipeline.fit or  NetworkPipeline.predict is called.\r\n\r\npipe = NetworkPipeline(\r\n    steps=[\r\n        (\"imputer\", Imputer(method=\"drift\"), {\"fit\": {\"Z\": \"original_y\"}, \"predict\": None}),\r\n        (\"forecaster\", NaiveForecaster(strategy=\"last\", sp=12), {\"fit\": {\"y\": \"imputer\"}, \"predict\": {\"fh\": \"original_y\"}})\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Classification example\r\npipe = NetworkPipeline(\r\n        steps=[\r\n            (\"tabularizer\", Tabularizer(), {\"X\": \"original_X\"}),\r\n            ( \"classifier\", DummyClassifier(strategy=\"prior\"), {\r\n                         fit\": {\"X\": \"tabularizer\", \"y\": \"original_y\"},\r\n                         \"predict\": {\"X\": \"tabularizer\"} })\r\n        ]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n- Is proposed interface intuitive?\r\n- Should the steps be executed sequentially or in any order defined by the user? This would be achieved if the `arguments` dictionary can refer to future steps. This feature is not currently supported in my design.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [ ] Improve examples by adding more than two steps.\r\n- [ ] Write checks and tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-02T17:40:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T05:56:40Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6aa290e471323d0321b620f940c8a1eb6597b5aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/06df0f7d2e60075cfa5bbf6f508893bdbd2e10b7","head":{"label":"ViktorKaz:pipeline_prototype","ref":"pipeline_prototype","sha":"06df0f7d2e60075cfa5bbf6f508893bdbd2e10b7","user":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":309707306,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDk3MDczMDY=","name":"sktime","full_name":"ViktorKaz/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ViktorKaz","id":33499138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33499138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz","html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViktorKaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ViktorKaz/sktime","description":"A
