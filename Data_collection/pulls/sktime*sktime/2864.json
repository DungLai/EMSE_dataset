In the future, this should be refactored into an \"apply-to\" interface of `VectorizedDF`, there is repetitive boilerplate and logic that should not be in the base classes. Deprecation is not necessary since the public interfaces of the base classes did not change.\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed to addess https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2547 for
