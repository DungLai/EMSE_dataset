Explain your changes.\r\n\r\n I do not think this is contentious or requires a core developer meeting to approve, for the following reasons\r\n\r\n1. The methods are already conceptually abstract, this just allows us to enforce it, implicitly checking all classifiers properly extend the base class. There is no design change. \r\n2. Using ABC is a completely standard way of making abstract methods in python.\r\n3. ABC is already used in forecasting, benchmarking, clustering and distances. \r\n\r\nany debate about possible other uses of ABC, or changes in the current design utilising ABC, are, in my opinion, secondary to this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
