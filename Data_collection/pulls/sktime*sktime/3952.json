From now on, `initial_window=0` should be used instead of `start_with_window=False`. Contains bugfix https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3953 as the deprecation logic was incomplete.\r\n* Test `test_methods_do_not_change_state` renamed to `test_non_state_changing_method_contract`\r\n* row transformers have been removed, replaced by base class vectorization/broadcasting\r\n* changed default for `default_fc_parameters` in `tsfresh` transformers to follow the default of `tsfresh`, which currently is `comprehensive`\r\n* removed module `transformations.series.compose`. All contents were moved to `transformations.compose`.\r\n\r\nDelayed to 0.16.0:\r\n* base class of `ProbabilityThresholdEarlyClassifier` change to `BaseEarlyClassifier`. Unclear what to do here, deprecation action specified breaks the interface compliance tests. Attempt to fix here https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3962 but fails `fit_idempotent` test (unclear why, will drop for this release).\r\n* change of forecaster `cutoff` attribute to `pd.Index`
