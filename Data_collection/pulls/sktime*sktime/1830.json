Explain your changes.\r\nRemoves use of `_get_freq` in the `fh.to_absolute()` conversion. `_get_freq` removes anchorings, this was causing issues when users needed to convert a frequency involving an anchoring as the information was lost and the horizon defaults back to \"W-SUN\" even if another day e.g. \"W-WED\" was specified.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nno\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nWhether this change impacts other parts of the code. Presumably this functionality of removing anchorings is there for a reason, it just seems unnecessary for the `to_absolute` functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all
