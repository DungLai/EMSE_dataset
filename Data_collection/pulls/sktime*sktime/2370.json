This is functionality which is now integrated into the base class, i.e., `fit` and `transform` automatically vectorize (see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2219).\r\n\r\nFor the deprecation period, `make_row_transformer` will return the transformer passed to it (since it already has the functionality it was meant to attach), and the row transformers will simply patch through all transformer methods.\r\n\r\nRelies on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3087 to ensure panel compatibility of `sklearn` `FunctionTransformer`, by closing the gap between \"stateless\" scopes.","created_at":"2022-04-02T16:39:26Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T20:14:14Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T20:14:14Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T20:14:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"197d48265dbbf1a661a9acc5c3a6ad61c5af9330","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789327275,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3Iur","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":"Restructuring without changing its external behavior.
