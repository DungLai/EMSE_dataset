Explain your changes.\r\nIn our docs, binder button on top of notebooks should point to correct version since we're now using versioned docs. On master, binder link in README should point to master branch and build based on master. \r\n\r\nWasn't sure how to best solve this, options included: \r\n\r\n* using a `postBuild` file,\r\n* using a `Dockerfile`,\r\n* installing from nightly builds (see e.g. scikit-learn)\r\n\r\nFor now I've added a `Dockerfile`. `postBuild` would have required to move all binder related config files from the `.binder/` folder into the root directory. Setting up nightly builds and wheel storage requires much more work. \r\n\r\nThis seems to solve most links, except the link of the binder launch button on the README.rst which will still point to master even if you're viewing the documentation for one of the stable versions on readthedocs. \r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n- [x] reset settings to always run notebooks in conf.py, here disabled for faster debugging\r\n\r\nSpeeding up build can be achieved by building the docker image separately in a GitHub Action: see [this
