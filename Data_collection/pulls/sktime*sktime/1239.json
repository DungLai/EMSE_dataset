Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nRefactor `ROCKETEstimator` class according to the [new extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/classification.py).\r\n- fit and predict turned private\r\n- `capabilities` class attribute renamed to `_tags` class attribute\r\n- capabilities names prefixed with `capability:` prefix\r\n- new tags added to ESTIMATOR_TAG_REGISTER\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n- `capability:missing_values` and `capability:multivariate` are intentionally kept distinct from `handles-missing-values` and `univariate-only` to stick to `capability:` prefix convention at least until refactoring ends. It looks like it will be easier merge them after refactoring and rename all occurences at once.\r\n- I do not know meaning for `train_estimate` and `contractable` tags, so I need help to fill them\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
