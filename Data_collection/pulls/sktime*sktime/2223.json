There are only two cases of parameters, depending on which substring appears in the class name.\r\nThis is resolved by having a single `get_test_params` at the intermediate base class and a case distinction based on class name.\r\n\r\nWhile we're there, the `window_length` parameter has been reduced to 3 to allow quicker testing, and later reduction of the series lengths in the test suite.","created_at":"2022-03-14T22:18:22Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T16:06:46Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T16:06:45Z","merged_at":"2022-03-29T16:06:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8be0b39f0b2f2ccce68b5d53322788a431b373f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3137622230,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM3NjIyMjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:tests","name":"module:tests","color":"43421D","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/eef5cc7c6de031be0de434413243738100227895","head":{"label":"sktime:reducer-get_test_params","ref":"reducer-get_test_params","sha":"eef5cc7c6de031be0de434413243738100227895","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","re
