This has been removed, and remedied by adding the `\"fit-in-transform\"` tag to all pairwise transformers (set to `True` by default).\r\n\r\nI would particularly appreciate a review by @TonyBagnall and @chrisholder.\r\n\r\nPS: while doing this, I noted that the math in the `distances` module docstrings seems incorrect or incomplete, I've collated the points in issue
