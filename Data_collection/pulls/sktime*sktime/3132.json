(see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2807 and https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2880)\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell this bug was caused by the fact that Differencer reduces the size of X. Usually this isn't a problem, but because ForecastingGridSearchCV was pre-trimming all X input before passing it into the underlying forecaster, X ended up being too small by the time it got to the final forecaster and was causing problems.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is thus simply - avoid pre-trimming X in the _split function and instead trim it to the right size right before the actual forecasting step. (I do this specifically in _predict_last_window, but there is a decent chance it might need to be changed elsewhere as well).","created_at":"2022-07-29T17:29:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T19:39:36Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T19:39:36Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T19:39:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a18f71b0531c71d6fb8fcbd331004b338a1e1e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3132/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3132/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3132/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/fcff6e0789b19a83f36742f9389d6d7fb69b5572","head":{"label":"miraep8:forecastinggridcv_pipeline_bug","ref":"forecastinggridcv_pipeline_bug","sha":"fcff6e0789b19a83f36742f9389d6d7fb69b5572","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"sktime:main","ref":"main","sha":"824804c785fb97e20c29045ee058181ceeb9418b","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
