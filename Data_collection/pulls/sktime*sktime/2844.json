This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n(was difficult to spot since the condition is a rare combination of (a) a transformer uses `y` at all, and (b) vectorization happens)\r\n\r\nRelation to the bugs:\r\n* after the type inference bug in #2841 is fixed, the test example posted by me breaks due to this unreported bug\r\n* in #2711, it seem like `X` in the forecaster is not properly aggregated. There is not a clear causal link, and the vectorization in forecasters seem correct. Still there is something going on that seems similar, so I reference it.","created_at":"2022-06-21T17:28:48Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T19:02:08Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T19:02:07Z","merged_at":"2022-06-21T19:02:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a776c8bb1893873ba63c1f0fbcb6afb8a809e23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
