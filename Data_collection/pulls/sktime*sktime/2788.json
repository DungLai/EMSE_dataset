is an attempted fix for #2739.\r\n\r\nThe fix is ensuring that, when converting a univariate `pd.DataFrame` to `pd.Series`, that the output `pd.Series` retains the  `pd.DataFrame` column name as `pd.Series` name.\r\n\r\nIncludes #2790 to check that we've solved #2739.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this leads to breakage through `NaiveForecaster` which handles columns and names inconsistently.\r\nThat is addressed by a hard-fix of storing names/columns in `_fit` and overwriting whatever comes out of `_predict`.\r\nAt some point, we may want to untangle the nested, organically grown mess that is `NaiveForecaster` and clean it up, but until that day it at least has the right return format now.","created_at":"2022-06-11T13:40:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-27T18:45:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4424419cbd37c85ddbece81f8d3c75f298b482e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3745673790,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7fQnI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:datatypes","name":"module:datatypes","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
