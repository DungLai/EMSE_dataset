PR (hopefully) fixes the bug reported in #2291, and a parallel bug in `ForecastingPipeline`.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the assumption that the bug in #2291 is caused by incorrect implementation of `update` in `TransformedTargetForecaster`, where `transform` of the transformers in the pipeline were not being called, and all `update` were called on the input data.\r\n\r\nDepends on #2300 which fixes an issue arising from current tests causing empty `y` being passed to `update` when `update_predict` is called within those tests, which is encountered by the fix.","created_at":"2022-03-24T19:38:00Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:42:43Z","closed_at":"2022-03-26T15:42:42Z","merged_at":"2022-03-26T15:42:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"85126dbcf750a490698d20bb8163d3c7a0feaac2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
