Explain your changes.\r\nThe Binder Dockerfile stopped working at some point. I changed the requirements files for the Docker file and it works now. The Docker file \"compiles\" and I ran the first example notebook in it. \r\n\r\nI changed the base Docker image used because the one that is in the current Dockerfile is just an arbitrary one copied from the Binder docs. I think that the Jupyter Notebook Python 3.8 is a reasonable base image because it already contains some of the needed libraries and Python 3.8 is the newest version that can currently be used with Numba (according to my understanding).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution yet because something is broken with the way Prophet is being built but this can only be changed once the Prophet developers fix it. I know it is weird to have two requirement files but Prophet doesn't build without having some libraries installed first.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
