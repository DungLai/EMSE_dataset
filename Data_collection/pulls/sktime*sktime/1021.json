This becomes most clear when you look at what the `update` mode should be - temporal, or adding more sequences?\r\n\r\nChanges in both classes:\r\n* rename of series to be annotated from `Z` to `X` - the user expectation is `predict(X)` not `predict(Z)`\r\n* `X` is by default a `pd.DataFrame`, not `pd.Series`. Annotation is typically multivariate, and this is in compliance with the target interface for forecasting.\r\n* adopted nested `fit/_fit` architecture from `forecasting` refactor - it's consensus we're moving towards this, see also #993\r\n* additional, optional argument in `fit`: `Y`, ground truth annotations - for supervised annotation\r\n* allow annotations to be of any `pandas` `dtype`, this allows complex annotations like BIDS (see sktime neuro https://github.com/sktime/sktime-neuro/issues/7)\r\n\r\nAdditions in the `BaseStreamAnnotator`:\r\n\r\n* `update` and `update_predict` functionality, so we can use it in time series streams and directly with forecasters\r\n\r\nAdditions in `BasePanelAnnotator`:\r\n* `X` can be a list of sequences to be annotated (all `pd.DataFrame`)\r\n* additional, optional argument in `fit` and `predict`: `Z`, `pd.DataFrame` of same `len` as `X` - any metadata on the sequences to annotate.","created_at":"2021-06-22T19:23:52Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T20:15:21Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T20:14:27Z","merged_at":"2021-07-06T20:14:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d8f300a14a06d5aec5e1b0f55dc2d519196c844","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180363817,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzYzODE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/API%20design","name":"API
