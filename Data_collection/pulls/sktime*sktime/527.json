The question that comes here is which index has the first prediction e.g. when doing `model.predict(1)`. From my understanding, this has index 1 and not 0? So just did `pred.index = pd.RangeIndex(start=pred.index.start + 1, stop = pred.index.stop + 1)\r\n`. Is this ok for you?\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Question 2:**\r\nI haave seen that when I do e.g. `model.predict(5)`, the fh is set to `ForecastingHorizon([5], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)` automatically. Is this a design pupose? As a user I would expect to get all 5 steps predicted, so `fh` could be set to `ForecastingHorizon([1,2,3,4,5], dtype='int64', is_relative=True)` instead. What do you think?\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Question 3:**\r\nThis PR yet contains only BATS. To add TBATS there are two options. Both, BATS and TBATS have the same args and fit/predict function. Options:\r\n1. Adding an arg like `type=BATS` \r\n2. Creating a new file `tbats.py` and inherit from `bats.py`. This is my preffered option :) Because then the user will not have to deal with a new arg that is unknown from original `tbats` packe interface.","created_at":"2020-12-06T22:21:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T15:19:00Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T15:18:00Z","merged_at":"2020-12-15T15:18:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"aea480f3f0cdbc8bb144d77b822c9de9f2befde4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/01cb6652b9cd225e06ee795d6705ecf5d1ce2c18","head":{"label":"aiwalter:tbats","ref":"tbats","sha":"01cb6652b9cd225e06ee795d6705ecf5d1ce2c18","user":{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"sktime:master","ref":"master","sha":"42a6041e2277bac623159f6b39924cb858d055a7","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
