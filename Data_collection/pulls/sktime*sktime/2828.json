Ideas will be discussed as a community about an annotation base class object, what it could look like.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nIntroduces a new concept/algorithm for segmentation given a (multivariate) timeseries.\r\n\r\nintrinsdim.py -> output is scalar value representing intrinsic dimensionality\r\nhidalgo.py -> extends the above model, assuming the data exists on a mixture of manifolds (each with corresponding dimension), output is a vector of size `N x 1` corresponding to each the multivariate input of size `N x c`. For example, if we assume there are `K=3` manifolds then an output vector for `N=10` would look like `(d_1, d_3, d_2, d_2, d_2, d_3, d_1, d_1, d_1, d_1)`, where `d_k` is the dimensionality for manifold `K`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nTDB.\r\nHidalgo relies on Gibbs sampling (MCMC) with a custom likelihood function in the model. Specifically, it is assumed that the neighborhood of a point is more likely to contain points from the same manifold than from different manifolds. This requirement is enforced with an additional term in the likelihood that penalizes local inhomogeneity [points belonging to different manifolds]. \r\n\r\nOptions for implementing the Gibbs sampler include:\r\n- including the C code from https://github.com/micheleallegra/Hidalgo/blob/master/python/gibbs.c\r\n- re-writing the model and Gibbs sampler in python\r\n- interfacing pymc, seeing if our model can be fed into an 'out-of-the-box' Gibbs method\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nReferences:
