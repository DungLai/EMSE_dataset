(see #2807 and #2880)\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell this bug was caused by the fact that `Differencer` reduces the size of `X`.  Usually this isn't a problem, but because `ForecastingGridSearchCV` was pre-trimming all `X` input before passing it into the underlying forecaster, `X` ended up being too small by the time it got to the final forecaster and was causing problems. \r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is thus simply - avoid pre-trimming `X` in the `_split` function and instead trim it to the right size right before the actual forecasting step. (I do this specifically in `_predict_last_window`, but there is a decent chance it might need to be changed elsewhere as well).","created_at":"2022-07-28T18:18:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T17:21:06Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T17:20:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a608344f86e4b40537f1edcf669b3d0e4e1e7cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3125/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3125/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3125/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/6cc2d87aa1cfea04155ef351829ebffd96e474f3","head":{"label":"miraep8:pipeline_trimming_bug_fix","ref":"pipeline_trimming_bug_fix","sha":"6cc2d87aa1cfea04155ef351829ebffd96e474f3","user":{"login":"miraep8","id":10511777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTExNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10511777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8","html_url":"https://github.com/miraep8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miraep8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"sktime:main","ref":"main","sha":"32fdc4e5c18538af01e12300a975327e40775e0b","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
