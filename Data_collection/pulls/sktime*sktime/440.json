Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to implement multi-output reduction strategy for ReducedRegressionForecaster. Currently there are some duplication of code that could be factored out depending on how we like to structure the code, I can continue the work on this but would like to get some early feedback. \r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are.
