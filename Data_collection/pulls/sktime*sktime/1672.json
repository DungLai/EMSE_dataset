Also updated instructions to ensure that the conda environment set up works from a fresh install to get an editable developer version.\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nContributes to part 1 of #1635 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nIt updates the Windows section of the development installation guide. Specifically it updates the instructions for installing Visual Studio Code for 2022 and clearly shows which components are needed. It also updates the sequence of commands to obtain a working conda environment for sktime development stating how to resolve some common dependency issues as well as some ways that users can check that their installation has worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nThe clarity of the new instructions. Is there anything else that should be addressed? Does the image I've added in the Build Tools for Visual Studio Tools section load correctly?\r\n\r\nI have kept as much of the old instructions as I could, for example attempting to install via `python setup.py install` outside an environment, however I couldn't get this to work myself. Should I remove this and only have instructions for an anaconda environment? Thus introducing a new requirement for windows installation, or keep it as is, as it may work for some people.\r\n \r\n#### Any other _comments?_\r\nI plan to make further changes to the order of the installation instructions once the restructuring in #1635 part 2 has taken place. This PR is simply to update the windows instructions so that they should work.
