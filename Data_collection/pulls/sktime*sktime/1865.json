Explain your changes.\r\n\r\n@fkiraly \r\nAs part of the probabilistic forecasting API, this will implement the `_predict_var` method to forecasters\r\n\r\n> #### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nSTEP [probabilistic forecasting API](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/13_proba_forecasting/step.md)\r\n\r\n> #### PR checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] add `_predict_var` and its corresponding tag to the forecasting extension template.\r\n- [x] add `NaiveVariance` composite class which implements the 'simple strategy' for variance prediction.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_var` and its corresponding in `NaiveVariance`.\r\n- [x] implement `_predict_quantiles` in `NaiveVariance` where quantiles are inferred from a normal distribution. \r\n- [x] implement covariance prediction (`cov=True`)\r\n\r\n> ##### For all contributions\r\n\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.","created_at":"2022-01-11T15:42:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T12:11:02Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T12:11:02Z","merged_at":"2022-03-25T12:11:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c32797c68e3503128a308f82b8e5241daec9df3","assignee":{"login":"IlyasMoutawwakil","id":57442720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDQyNzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57442720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil","html_url":"https://github.com/IlyasMoutawwakil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"IlyasMoutawwakil","id":57442720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDQyNzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57442720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil","html_url":"https://github.com/IlyasMoutawwakil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IlyasMoutawwakil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1865/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1865/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1865/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/06f729e7b68cf3e7f1156fcf1cb855a10bda04fd","head":{"label":"IlyasMoutawwakil:probabilistic_forecasting","ref":"probabilistic_forecasting","sha":"06f729e7b68cf3e7f1156fcf1cb855a10bda04fd","user":{"login":"IlyasMoutaw
