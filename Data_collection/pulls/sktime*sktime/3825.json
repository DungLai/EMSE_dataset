See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nThis would close [Issue-3824](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/3824) as well as [Issue-541](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/541). There have been multiple other PRs for the original issue but as far as I can see they're all closed ([545](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/545), [802](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/802)).\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAllows user to pass `pred_interval` to `plot_series()` and plot the confidence interval provided in that argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nAny other edge cases I need to check for? So far there is pretty rigorous check of the schema of the interval DataFrame, and there's a check to ensure the index matches that of the final series passed to the function.\r\n\r\nOnce there's some buy in for this approach I'll add at least one test case.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what killed the other attempts at this feature, it's been discussed for at least two years. I think we start simple and then expand to the `predict_quantiles()`, multivariate, plotting kwargs, and other more complex cases after.","created_at":"2022-11-22T00:41:38Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T18:13:35Z","closed_at":"2022-12-02T18:13:35Z","merged_at":"2022-12-02T18:13:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"071d4891484ceb96cb9fbe13f943770323d6fcf1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/3825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/3825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/e85c9543834677aa379db1999847b81729483089","head":{"label":"chillerobscuro:plot-interval","ref":"plot-interval","sha":"e85c9543834677aa379db1999847b81729483089","user":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":527688899,"node_id":"R_kgDOH3Pkww","name":"sktime","full_name":"chillerobscuro/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chillerobscuro","id":5232872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5232872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro","html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chillerobscuro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chillerobscuro/sktime","description":"A
