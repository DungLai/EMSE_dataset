PR introduces a pipeline object for time series classification where the last object is an `sklearn` classifier.\r\n\r\nDifferently from current pipeline constructs involving sklearn classifiers, this (a) inherits from `BaseClassifier` and hence also performs all the input checks and conversions, or can be used in further composition, and (b) also allows for both series-to-primitives and series-to-series transformers to be chained.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the tests are still failing due to use of `SummaryTransformer` as series-to-primitives, and its issue with output signature in case of a multivariate input object, see also discussion in #1719 and todos in #2717.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2720 due to use of `SummaryTransformer` for testing multivariate time series classifiers pipelines (7 of 9 files touched are due to #2720).","created_at":"2022-05-29T12:03:48Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T20:25:32Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T20:25:31Z","merged_at":"2022-06-09T20:25:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0f394b72ecccac523a4879c372426ca76bed9f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
