Internal docstrings are updated accordinly. Not a public attribute, so no deprecation necessary. FYI @chrisholder.\r\n* removes the `self.scoring_metric_call` and `self.knn_mask` writes in `transform` of `ClaSPTransformer`, this was unnecessary as `scoring_metric_call` is read out directly after, so could be replaced by a function call. `knn_mask` is not read at all. FYI @patrickzib \r\n* removes the `self.aligner_` write in `DistFromAligner`, as that was not read from
