Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nI have added a new argument 'return_tags' to the registry function all_estimators().  'return_tags' is an optional argument, either a str or list of str of tag names the user wants returned for all estimators returned.  If provided all_estimators will return each estimator's value for each tag in 'return_tags' or else None if the estimator doesn't have that tag.  I also added a new test to ensure all_estimators works if 'return_tags' is passed as a str or list of str. (the default - None is tested in other tests!)\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
