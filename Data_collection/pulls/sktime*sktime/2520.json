Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nEssentially - run `ForecastingGridSearchCV`  on `MultiplexForecaster` and verify that the best forecaster from the grid search is also the one we select if we simply evaluated all the forecasters separately. \r\n\r\n*Note - I use a very small data set and only compare have 2 forecasters in `MultiplexForecaster`.  I did this to not make the test too slow - but it is not the most thorough test.  Hopefully it would still help catch some obvious issues.*\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nAny other obvious tests that should be added? Should we add more forecasters?  Does this test make sense to you? \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n@aiwalter I went ahead and added you as an author to this file.  I figured since you had a hand in co-creating `MultiplexForecaster` in the first place and also weighed in on #2514 it seemed reasonable.  However - please let me know if you would prefer if I removed you. \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either
