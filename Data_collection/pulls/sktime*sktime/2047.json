This occurs when the forecasting horizon starts in sample, as the window length is the full length of the data but there is not enough historical data to fill the window so I have added NA's in this case. There is precedent for this as NAs are added to satisfy a window length in the case that the window length isn't a multiple of `sp`. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nDoes this fix work theoretically.
