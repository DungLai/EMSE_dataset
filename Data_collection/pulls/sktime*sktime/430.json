See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdd the ability to download and use any dataset present on timeseriesclassification.com through a single function call. Following example is for downloading and loading the 'Car' dataset\r\n```X, y = load_dataset_proxy(\"Car\", split=None, return_X_y=True)```\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nN/A\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nI wasn't quite sure if I should convert ``_load_dataset`` function from a 'protected function' to a public function so I made a proxy function to access it for now, also I noticed by renaming it it would break certain tests, so I thought it would be best to ask how to proceed. This currently does not delete downloaded file types that are not used by sktime, let me know if it should delete irrelevant file types. Sorry if anything looks weird, I tried to follow the code guide as best I could.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->","created_at":"2020-10-13T22:19:12Z","updated_at":"2020-10-15T22:33:09Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T22:33:09Z","merged_at":"2020-10-15T22:33:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"ecca49bff53001ac5a706a7e25167d0c5809a01a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/431803ce1bce2e836ccb8d9a58dd473f7616e10e","head":{"label":"Emiliathewolf:dataset-download","ref":"dataset-download","sha":"431803ce1bce2e836ccb8d9a58dd473f7616e10e","user":{"login":"Emiliathewolf","id":22026218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDI2MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22026218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf","html_url":"https://github.com/Emiliathewolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299300075,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkzMDAwNzU=","name":"sktime","full_name":"Emiliathewolf/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Emiliathewolf","id":22026218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDI2MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22026218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf","html_url":"https://github.com/Emiliathewolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Emiliathewolf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Emiliathewolf/sktime","description":"A
