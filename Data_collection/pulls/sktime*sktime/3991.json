FYI @KishManani, @danbartl.\r\n\r\nCombining information from @danbartl and @KishManani, I understood where the issue must have been coming from - from a line of `np.diff` on the checked index, in `_index_equally_spaced`, but only in the case of `pd.PeriodIndex` (the latter condition I only understood from @KishManani's analysis).\r\n\r\nI have used this insight to replace the time and memory consuming check by a much quicker one, exploiting mathematical assumptions on the `pd.PeriodIndex` (unique and sorted index).\r\n\r\nWhile this PR seems to address the issue, some open questions remain:\r\n\r\n* do we want to test this fix, or in general, checks being fast and not memory intensive? If yes, how? Runtimes can vary even on VM.\r\n* is @danbartl's fix in https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/3935 redundant or complementary? It seems to address hierarchical and panel types primarily, so I could imagine it either makes no difference, or helps speed up things if the series check is fast.","created_at":"2022-12-24T15:35:37Z","updated_at":"2022-12-30T14:06:56Z","closed_at":"2022-12-30T14:06:55Z","merged_at":"2022-12-30T14:06:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"e13e95f662372fee927f7d1a19bafc03d53519d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3745673790,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7fQnI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:datatypes","name":"module:datatypes","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3796180314,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7iRR1a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"fef2c0","default":true,"description":"Adding
