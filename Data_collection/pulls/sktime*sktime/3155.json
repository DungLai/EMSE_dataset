PR expands on a discussion I recently had with @miraep8, where it was suggested that we should perhaps treat `sktime` more as a library of algorithms (like `openml` or `huggingface`) than an expert curated selection like `sklearn`.\r\n\r\nRelated recent discussions are those about which algorithms we should include (or not).\r\n\r\nA salomonic solution, suggested by @miraep8, would be to simply include everything that meets the standards of having a basic scientific reference, i.e., all algorithms that have a minimal description of basic scientific quality.\r\n\r\nI would actually be in favour of this idea.\r\n\r\nI have made a proposed change to the governance document.\r\n\r\nRelates to the changes in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/3154 that clarify the role of algorithm maintainer and algorithm ownership, but are orthogonal in that this PR discusses the scope of which algorithms are included rather than the relation of relevant roles to it.","created_at":"2022-08-01T12:02:54Z","updated_at":"2022-08-21T14:33:11Z","closed_at":"2022-08-21T14:33:10Z","merged_at":"2022-08-21T14:33:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb21f28e421d905d851566b34b6be65c2402a8df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2163929092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTYzOTI5MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/governance","name":"governance","color":"edd69e","default":false,"description":"Governance
