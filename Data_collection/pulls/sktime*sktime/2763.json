Explain your changes.\r\nInterfacing VARMAX from statsmodels, with corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nQuestions:\r\n- Is there a list of estimators I need to add VARMAX to?\r\n- In var.py, there's code in predict() that I don't understand. I initially copied across this (with out-sample predictions using forecast and in-sample predictions using the diff of residuals from the fitted object). I'm not sure why? Instead, for this, I used the predict() method from statsmodels (returns In-sample predictions / Out-of-sample forecasts). Checking that I'm not missing anything here!\r\nhttps://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.varmax.VARMAXResults.predict.html\r\n- get_prediction() in statsmodels also gives confidence intervals, do we want to include this?\r\n- In the example (provided in the doc string), it fails the test for stationarity and hence we get: UserWarning: Non-stationary starting autoregressive parameters found. Using zeros as starting parameters.\r\nshould we normalise this dataset in the example(s)? (same data in the VAR doc string example)\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n@fkiraly @lmmentel @Lovkush-A
