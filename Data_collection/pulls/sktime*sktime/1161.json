Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR generates a summary of the capabilities of different classifiers. The main list of classifiers included showing their capabilities tags. \r\nFor clarity, some utility classifiers, such as ColumnEnsembleClassifier, ComposableTimeSeriesForestClassifier, IndividualBOSS, IndividualTDE, ProximityStump, ProximityTree, are not included as they miss such tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis PR generates csv file with the summary of the capabilities of classifiers. Kindly note below,\r\n\r\n1. Below command is not used as it throughs an error with the compatibility of fbprophet.\r\n           from sktime.utils import all_estimators\r\n2. Some utility classifiers miss the capabilities tags which I am focusing to implement in next PR.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nI would really be grateful if you could spare some time to review and approve it. @mloning @TonyBagnall @ABostrom \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
