Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe extension guidelines: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\nFollowup on comments under #220. \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\nAdding these code to the tutorial makes it clearer how to tune the parameters of sklearn regressors, and how to use the scoring option of ForecastingGridSearchCV. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate\r\n companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum. \r\n-->\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n<!--\r\nThis is only relevant if you contribute a new estimator\r\n (classifiers, regressors, forecasters, etc\r\n.). If so, please go through the checklist below. Otherwise please ignore check list.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n- [ ] I've updated sktime's [estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the list of contributors\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-01T22:06:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T13:27:11Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T13:27:10Z","merged_at":"2020-08-03T13:27:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"94ca20f679192fd71e14e1c2e6f6a77e493db2fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1203928605,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAzOTI4NjA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"f4bdf9","default":true,"description":"Documentation
