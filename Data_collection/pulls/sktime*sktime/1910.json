Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Refactors `predict_quantiles` for FBProphet.\r\n- Changes the test to only check if `pred_int['upper'] >= pred_int['lower']`.\r\n- Implements a fix for when the X contains a variable named \"ds\", by copying the column to another column and renaming in the case the column is numeric and not an index. This is done in order to be more consistent with the other forecasters, which don't throw an error if exogenous X contains a column \"ds\" related to #1712.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
