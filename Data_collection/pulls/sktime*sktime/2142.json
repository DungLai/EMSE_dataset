This is a 1:1 replicate of https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1987\r\n* refactor `test_all_forecasters` along the lines of this architecture, from https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/1992\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes minor changes to the conditional fixtures plugin: \r\n* producing more readable test names\r\n* fixing a bug that could occur if the fixture list was length two (it would be confused with a tuple return, since only length and not type was checked)\r\n* added comments throughout the fixture parameter tuple construction that clarify what is happening\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the diffs in `test_all_estimators` and `test_all_forecasters` look intimidating, but are mostly caused by added indentation - as functions move to the classes, a single indentation is added to most code, and a \"self\" argument is added to the function signature. Some fixtures are moved to the generator functions.","created_at":"2022-02-26T01:06:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-26T14:22:35Z","closed_at":"2022-02-26T14:22:34Z","merged_at":"2022-02-26T14:22:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"03646a1ccd4c9151f7d2166ec3b82e1b570b2cc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lmmentel","id":8989838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8989838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmentel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmentel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"freddyaboulton","id":41651716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjUxNzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41651716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton","html_url":"https://github.com/freddyaboulton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freddyaboulton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1631667223,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMxNjY3MjIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/maintenance","name":"maintenance","color":"ea761e","default":false,"description":"Continuous
