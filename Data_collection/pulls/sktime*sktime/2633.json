fixes various incompatibilities of `sktime` with the recent sklearn 1.1.0 release:\r\n* fixes #2631 by moving the private `_check_param_grid` (which broke at sklearn 1.1.0) from sklearn 1.0.2 to sktime\r\n* fixes breakage caused by `DecisionTreeClassifier` of `sklearn` no longer accepting float for `max_depth`\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the newly introduced upper sklearn bound to
