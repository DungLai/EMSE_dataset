the functionality discussed in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1614, i.e., a `reset` method in `BaseObject` that resets attributes and internal state of an estimator/object to its post-`__init__` state (while keeping parameters), equivalent to overwriting `self` with a `sklearn.clone`.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the bug in `MultiplexForecaster` which @miraep8's test suite uncovered in combination with https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2458, and the observation that:\r\n* boilerplate needs to be copied from `__init__` to `_fit` to fix it, and\r\n* that the same issue possibly exists in a number of other composites which are not tested for subsequent `fit` with different parameters.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `reset` at the start of `BaseForecaster.fit`, addressing a family of potential bugs where not initializing in `_fit` causes unexpected behaviour in a sequence of calls `fit`, `set_params`, `fit` (the bug present in the original #2458).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, or additionally, we could also `reset` whenever we `set_params`.\r\n\r\nRelies on PR https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2533 since `_MockEstimatorMixin` clashes with `reset`.","created_at":"2022-04-22T21:27:04Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T12:10:47Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T12:10:46Z","merged_at":"2022-04-27T12:10:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7366622443c25c00e532ba66d2d60600a8ab23e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
