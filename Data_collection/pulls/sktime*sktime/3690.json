In the case of the former, a warning is raised that `start_with_window` will be depreciated in version 0.15.0.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a test case for when `initial_window=0` with `ExpandingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\nUnlike the last PR, the scope does not affect behavior of `SlidingWindowSplitter`. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nI imported `warn` but no real
