This is a change that should have been made a while ago, but apparently did not propagate from the governance document to the CoC.\r\n* introducese additional ideals: creation of fair opportunities for all, and free speech, while commenting trade-off cases. Why: fair opportunities refers to how resources are distributed - they must be distributed fairly and without discrimination. Free speech is important so the community can criticize and question decision making without leaders invoking \"discomfort\" to silence moments of accountability.\r\n\r\nMinor/secondary changes:\r\n* factors out the list mentioned as part of a sentence into a paragraph of \"protected characteristics\" which are then referred to in multiple locations.\r\n* adds some common characteristics to the list that I think just were unintentionally missing, e.g., national origin.\r\n* removes \"technical choices\" from protected characteristics. I don't think that's a protected characteristic.\r\n* adds explicit examples of unacceptable behaviour around resource allocation, aimed at community leaders who make decisions about money and resource. Also adds guidance on how the CoC is to be applied in such cases.\r\n* adds NumFOCUS as alternative entry
