Explain your changes.\r\nThis is a very first draft to apply a single series-transformer to a multivariate series in a column-wise manner\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nI'm not sure if this even goes in the direction you had in mind @fkiraly?\r\n\r\nThe main point I'm not sure how to tackle, is what to do about series transformers that also have functions that are not fit, transform, or inverse transform, e.g. the \"update\" in the detrender. My solution would be to have an extra \"apply\" function - but here I am currently relying on the fact, that any additional functions would return \"self\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis is just a draft. Tests will fail as I haven't set the _required_parameters = [\"transformer\"] in the test config yet \r\nJust wanted to get early feedback
