This choice was made since this documentation is not *functionally* dependent on the testing framework, to follow the \"compartmentalize PR\" principle.\r\n\r\nBesides the additional developer documentation on testing, this PR contains minor changes:\r\n* a concise bullet point list on \"developer first steps\" on the \"developer guide\" main page\r\n* a reordering of the items on the \"developer guide\" main page, in approximate order of decreasing importance (frequency a developer would look for
