Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems why `EnsembleForecaster` failed when ensembling multivariate forecasting models:\r\n\r\n1. The tags were set to `\"scitype:y\": \"univariate\"` which meant that only series were passed to the underlying ensembling models.\r\n    * This was changed to `\"scitype:y\": \"both\"`\r\n2. The method in which aggregated the predictions assumed that the model predictions are univariate.\r\n    * This was also changed\r\n    \r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nOn the `_predict` method of the `EnsembleForecaster`. This is where the major changes took place.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy.
