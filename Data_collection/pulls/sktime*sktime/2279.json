Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nAfter a lot of debugging in #2224, I found that the tests are failing for Windows because the series obtained when looping through `VetorizedDF` have frequency `None` in Windows and `\"D\"` for both Linux and Mac. The fix is to  add a new function that uses `pd.infer_freq` to update the frequency of each series in `VetorizedDF.__getitem__`.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.
