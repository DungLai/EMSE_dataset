Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #647. See also sktime/enhancement-proposals#8\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n- Makes `update_params=True` by default for all `update`-related forecasting methods.\r\n- Implements a refit in the base Forecaster class when `update_params=True`\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n- [x] I have set the Theta forecaster `update_params=False` for the `super().update` call since the function then does a custom  routine if `update_params=True`, so, presumably, we don't want to refit. I have also set the `Deseasonalizer` transform to use the updated `y` as opposed to just the passed `y`\r\n- [x] Assumption has been made that `update_predict` on a CV with `step_length>1` when `update_params=True` is not a desired use case for testing since the time-series is not continuous\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments\r\nThe behaviour of the Forecaster w.r.t. update is as follows:\r\nFirst, the Forecaster calls `fit` on a time period `y_a=y1,y2,...,yN`\r\nThen, when we call `update`, the Forecaster uses the new information, e.g. `y_b=yN+1,...,yN+k` along with the old information to update the model. If a custom `update` routine is not implemented, then we simply fit a new model on `y=concat(y_a,y_b)`.\r\n\r\nOriginal test failures have been isolated to when `step_length > 1`. In this case, when `update_params=True`, the model attempts to refit on a concatenation of the previous data (e.g. daily from \"2000-01-01\" to \"2000-02-01\") with the new data point as selected by the CV splitter. If the CV splitter has a `step_length > 1` then the frequency of the time series is no longer valid (e.g. daily up to \"2000-02-01\" then stepping multiple days into the future, e.g. \"2000-02-07\", before continuing at the same frequency)\r\n\r\nThe testing of `update_predict` where `step_length>1` and `update_params=True` has been left out, as a result.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] set `update_params=True` for all methods\r\n- [x] ensure all tests still pass when `update_params=False` (maintain original behaviour)\r\n- [x] implement refit method in base Forecaster using original and update data\r\n- [x] ensure all tests pass when `update_params=True` and `step_length=1`\r\n- [ ] check desired behaviour for `update_params=True` and `step_length>1`\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.","created_at":"2021-02-06T07:41:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T08:58:59Z","closed_at":"2021-02-14T14:23:49Z","merged_at":"2021-02-14T14:23:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"64487ee034bf47c7dc1f7f45b9f075ab884acf6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/2e923e0aa1d790c41cdf3b916fc224768d503d31","head":{"label":"pabworks:update_params_default_true","ref":"update_params_default_true","sha":"2e923e0aa1d790c41cdf3b916fc224768d503d31","user":{"login":"pabworks","id":32725127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI1MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32725127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks","html_url":"https://github.com/pabworks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333106622,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMxMDY2MjI=","name":"sktime","full_name":"pabworks/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pabworks","id":32725127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI1MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32725127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks","html_url":"https://github.com/pabworks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabworks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pabworks/sktime","description":"A
