Explain your changes.\r\nThe issue in `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe` happend because `has_class_labels_tag = False`. This is because the line \r\n\r\n```python\r\nelif line.startswith(\"@classlabel\"):\r\n     ....\r\n     has_class_labels_tag = True\r\n```\r\nis never  executed since the `line.startswith(\"@classlabel\")` is `False`\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nHow should the tag \"@classlabel\" be named,  `write_ndarray_to_tsfile` and `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe` depend on each other here. Another solution would be to allow multiple way of writing this tag in `load_from_tsfile_to_dataframe`\r\n\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of
