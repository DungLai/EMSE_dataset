The abstract method has been removed from `BaseForecaster` now, which should enable the default in all forecasters. (all other estimator types were unaffected)\r\n* for delegators, `_get_fitted_params` now delegates to the delegate's `get_fitted_params`, in line with all other delegation defaults.\r\n* the default `get_fitted_params` is robustified so that it queries fitted parameters (recursion) only from fitted components\r\n* a conditional override is added to `BaseForecaster` and `BaseTransformer` for the vectorized case (to avoid unfitted estimators present in underscore attributes)\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1497.\r\n\r\nThis should solve #1497 for all compositors that are delegates.\r\n\r\nRelies on:\r\n* #3391 for solving vectorization/`get_fitted_params` clashes\r\n* #3393 for solving vectorization/`get_fitted_params`
