Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nRefers to #3769 .\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR adds an unequal length, multivariate time series https://github.com/angus924/minirocket/blob/main/code/minirocket_multivariate_variable.py.\r\nThe MinirocketMultivariateVariable works similar to the MinirocketMultivariate, however can process multivariate timeseries with variable length, therefore requires an own Sktime interface. \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nAs this is my first contribution, give a broad feedback:\r\n- if the class is implemented correctly, and has sufficient tests\r\n- if the formatting is correct (check doc strings)\r\n- is the doc update sufficient (did not find more for other models)\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- also updated the notebook, where the `RidgeClassifierCV` has a deprecation warning of `normalizer=True`\r\n- \r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. (Python 3.10 conda env, wsl2 )\r\n- [x]The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [x] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [x] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-14T20:32:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T12:27:12Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T12:27:12Z","merged_at":"2022-11-29T12:27:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"c80f640dd5d86413a2b6fd53334a38a2204d2333","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"fkiraly","id":7985502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly","html_url":"https://github.com/fkiraly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkiraly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3796180314,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7iRR1a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"fef2c0","default":true,"description":"Adding
