Our DNS provider does not support ALIAS or ANAME records. Readthedocs does not provide stable IP addresses, so we cannot use A records either (see https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3104). So we can only point readthedocs to our subdomain www.sktime.org. Our DNS provider also does not support server-side redirects from sktime.org to www.sktime.org. To still serve our sktime.org apex domain, we create a dummy website (see docs-redirect branch) which redirects to our subdomain www.sktime.org and deploy it on GitHub Pages, for which we can set up the custom apex domain.\r\n
