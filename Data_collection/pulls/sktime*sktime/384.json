Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe extension guidelines: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInitial work on generators based on mention in #353 with @mloning.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis introduces univariate generators for random normal noise, ARMA process, and linear process with noise.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate\r\n companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo new dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n<!--\r\nThis is only relevant if you contribute a new estimator\r\n (classifiers, regressors, forecasters, etc\r\n.). If so, please go through the checklist below. Otherwise please ignore check list.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n- [ ] I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) and I'm committed to maintain my algorithm.\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the list of contributors\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot a new estimator.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-25T16:25:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T00:30:03Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T00:30:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3de891589450db16770dadc47ba73951c44cf49d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/384/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/384/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/384/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/c44e29a9bed4b2cec2e1e0dcb11423b39d38e6f6","head":{"label":"sjmiller8182:series_generators","ref":"series_generators","sha":"c44e29a9bed4b2cec2e1e0dcb11423b39d38e6f6","user":{"login":"sjmiller8182","id":4407736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDc3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4407736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182","html_url":"https://github.com/sjmiller8182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":290073625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTAwNzM2MjU=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sjmiller8182/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sjmiller8182","id":4407736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDc3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4407736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182","html_url":"https://github.com/sjmiller8182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjmiller8182/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sjmiller8182/sktime","description":"A
