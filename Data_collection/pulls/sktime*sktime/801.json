Please ensure you have taken a look\r\nat our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #671. See discussion on closed PR #672 that this pull request will complete. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdds additional forecasting metrics as discussed in #671. \r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request. I need to finish the docstrings (I'm adding examples to docstrings) and also write unit tests but wanted to give you a heads up of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe pull request adds new forecasting performance metrics (see list below) that can each work with multivariate series (but default to work with univariate forecasts). Also changes naming conventions to align with scikit-learn (e.g. mean_absoluate_error rather than mae or mae_loss).\r\n\r\nThe end result would be the following performance metric functions (each with a corresponding class version for scoring):\r\n\r\nrelative_error,\r\nmean_asymmetric_error,\r\nmean_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_scaled_error,\r\nmean_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmedian_squared_scaled_error,\r\nmean_absolute_error,\r\nmean_squared_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_squared_error,\r\nmean_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_absolute_percentage_error,\r\nmean_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmedian_squared_percentage_error,\r\nmean_relative_absolute_error,\r\nmedian_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_absolute_error,\r\ngeometric_mean_relative_squared_error\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNone. Pinning Scikit-learn dependency to >= 0.24.* was done separately.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\n\r\nFocus on changes in ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_functions.py and ./performance_metrics/forecasting/_classes.py. \r\n\r\nFinishing fixes elsewhere in module where old performance metric names (e.g. sMAPE) are imported. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing!\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-12T13:24:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T23:12:53Z","closed_at":"2021-04-30T14:02:34Z","merged_at":"2021-04-30T14:02:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ae13b048c2230b0029c5da3c691742b7d318fba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/7b7331daee6a42a549fc55355479f8fd893938fa","head":{"label":"RNKuhns:new-forecasting-metrics","ref":"new-forecasting-metrics","sha":"7b7331daee6a42a549fc55355479f8fd893938fa","user":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321519701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE1MTk3MDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"RNKuhns/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns/sktime","description":"A
