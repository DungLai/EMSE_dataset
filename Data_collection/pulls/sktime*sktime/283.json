If yes, which one? \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate\r\n companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum. \r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n<!--\r\nThis is only relevant if you contribute new algorithm or estimator (classifiers, regressors, forecasters, etc\r\n.). If so, please go through the checklist below. Otherwise please delete check list.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n- [ ] I have updated sktime's [estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is\r\nnecessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value\r\nall user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to\r\nreview, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,\r\nconvincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy.
