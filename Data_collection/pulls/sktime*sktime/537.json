Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/522\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAs outlined in https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/522, this fix allows using AutoARIMA with the sliding window forecaster along with Grid Search. This can allow for the search of the right hyperparameters such as sp.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo. `pmdarima` is already a soft dependency and this simply uses that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

I am only familiar with `unittest` and had some issues setting up `pytest` on my end so I could not add a unit test specifically for this. If you could add it for me, I would appreciate it.
