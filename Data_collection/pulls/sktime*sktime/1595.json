Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nWhen re-fitting (as opposed to updating) forecasting models self._y will be updated to the latest training data used.\r\nThis fix adds an additional check in update_y_X. If the forecaster is fitted it means that this is an update call (in fit the first line of code should be self._is_fitted = False). If it's fitted we use the combine first, if it's not fitted we overwrite _y with y. \r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n- [x] Does combine_first have a different purpose that this fix will break (maybe when update is used).   (It does) \r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [X] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass
