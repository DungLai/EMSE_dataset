Instead adopts a wrapper pattern around the `sklearn` public interface, with much of the code simplified through passing distance matrices directly to `sklearn`.\r\n* extends the interface to allow passing of arbitrary distances that are callables. This supports the composable distance interface from #1858 out-of-the-box (with `sklearn` style parameter inspectable composition/pipelining), and can be used to plug in custom time series distances.\r\n* tests that rely on random seeds are updated with new expected output values\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes two unreported bugs:\r\n* the `algorithm` parameter of `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` was not passed to the `sklearn` `KNeighbors` classifier, the value being passed was always the default `\"brute\"`. https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/2774\r\n* corrected docstring in `pairwise_distance` which was missing options\r\n\r\nand makes one minor change:\r\n* replaces loops in tests for `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` by `mark.parametrize`","created_at":"2022-02-06T15:20:22Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T17:25:25Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T17:25:24Z","merged_at":"2022-07-28T17:25:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"2cbed068a62b458e3a652a471a036f04e917490f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"jasonlines","id":38794632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Nzk0NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38794632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3102418261,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTAyNDE4MjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:classification","name":"module:classification","color":"BEB114","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/1998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/1998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/6d613eb53043387f2b33a2f298d1a0fbf3065f26","head":{"label":"sktime:knn_better","ref":"knn_better","sha":"6d613eb53043387f2b33a2f298d1a0fbf3065f26","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
