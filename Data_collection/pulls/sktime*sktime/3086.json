See also https://github.com/intive-DataScience/tbats/issues/35 for discussion. \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nImplements update method for tbats, which allows users to update state fo the model with new observations (fast) without refitting model parameters (slow). Particualrly, useful for walk-forward prediction and validation.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\nNo new dependencies were introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\nThere are a number of potential places I could implement this change. I thought the _tbats.py file with the adapter class was the most natural but let me know if this was not the intended design / pattern. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis is my first contribution to a public code base. Would appreciate any feedback and, if happy, would be interested in contributing more (eg. related issues #3064 and #3065).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-24T17:13:04Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T15:40:36Z","closed_at":"2022-07-25T13:49:55Z","merged_at":"2022-07-25T13:49:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e1658d359699bbb5367e1385dc9f4878139a56f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mloning","id":21020482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDIwNDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21020482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning","html_url":"https://github.com/mloning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mloning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180391124,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzkxMTI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/interfacing%20algorithms","name":"interfacing
