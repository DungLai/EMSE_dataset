Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented. \r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe algorithm that I have implemented here is ShapeDTW which is similar to ordinary DTW except that instead of performing DTW on the original time series, you transform it into a list of arrays or shapelets. DTW is then performed on these list of arrays. This algorithm involved implementing several new transformers - SlidingWindowSegmenter, DerivativeTransformer, DWTTransformer and more. This algorithm did require writing a helper function in TimeSeriesNeighbours so that this module is compatible with multivariate classification (the distance metrics are compatable but the original TimeSeriesNeighbours is not). \r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n\r\nNot anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist for new estimators \r\n\r\n- [x] I have added unit tests and made sure they pass locally. \r\n \r\n- [ ] I have updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my algorithm works.\r\n   \r\n- [x] I have updated sktime's \r\n[estimator overview](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/ESTIMATOR_OVERVIEW.md) and I'm\r\n committed to maintain my contribution and provide bug fixes if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### Any other
