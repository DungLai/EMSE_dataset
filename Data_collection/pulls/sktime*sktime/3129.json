Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis adds the base class `_predict_quantiles` method into `conformal.py` to ensure that the `_predict_quantiles` method for the forecaster that is wrapped with `conformal.py` is consistent with `_predict_interval`.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nI have just copied and pasted the base class `_predict_quantiles` method and removed the `implements_interval` check . Should this be amended at all? \r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [x] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [x] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass
