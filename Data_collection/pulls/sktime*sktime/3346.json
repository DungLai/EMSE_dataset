This is highly unexpected behaviour, as @ilkersigirci pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe fix was not easy due to domino effects in the code, effectifely I rewrote the `Differencer` entirely.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is as in the expectation @ilkersigirci has outlined: when `inverse_transform` is called, previously seen data is taken into account when inverting, in a window before the data to be inverted that has the length of cumulative lag.\r\nFor multiple lag values, this requires logic to compute iterated differences in that window.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `Differencer` now always properly inverts in `inverse_transform`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds:\r\n* the test case of @ilkersigirci, minimally modified, so as not to include the value at the first index which is required to be outside the `fh` for proper inversion.\r\n* a parameter `memory` for the `Differencer` which allows to control how much of the data seen in `fit`/`update` should be remembered for potential inversion.","created_at":"2022-08-25T23:02:34Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T20:57:46Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T20:57:46Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T20:57:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"468b6135b2691d3d39ec59a35a40112cca51adf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105907331,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA3MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:transformations","name":"module:transformations","color":"0865AF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
