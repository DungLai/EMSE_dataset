tests are checking for `predict_interval` and `predict_quantile` being of the right format, but not for being consistent with each other.\r\n\r\nThis has led to undetected bugs in the past, such as #2135 and #2275.\r\n\r\nThe tests added check two things:\r\n* correctness of the default converter logic in `BaseForecaster`'s `_predict_interval` and `_predict_coverage`\r\n* consistency between `_predict_interval` and `_predict_coverage`, for corresponding values of `alpha` and `coverage`.","created_at":"2022-03-27T17:39:11Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T22:20:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1aaf33c88955d7c9264c321073629af7c4de762c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/3a9b52def29557554d9a37a94ff60f50f61a77db","head":{"label":"sktime:test-baseforecaster-interval_quantiles-defaults","ref":"test-baseforecaster-interval_quantiles-defaults","sha":"3a9b52def29557554d9a37a94ff60f50f61a77db","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
