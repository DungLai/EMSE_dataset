As a shorthand for \"transform right away\", `fit_transform` should be called, not `transform`.","created_at":"2021-11-28T22:03:28Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T17:31:32Z","closed_at":"2021-12-07T17:31:31Z","merged_at":"2021-12-07T17:31:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4549b4eb915dc4998ab3f3a3930e668331e7dfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"RNKuhns","id":26907244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTA3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26907244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns","html_url":"https://github.com/RNKuhns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RNKuhns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1118163262,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTE4MTYzMjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
