Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nIssue #356 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nAn example is given how to read DICOM waveform and bringing it quickly to a format where one can use sktime.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nIn order to to run the example (notebook) 'pydicom' is needed.\r\nAlso note that a .dcm file was introduced in the example directory (the file was taken from https://github.com/marcodebe/dicom-ecg-plot)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nThe original issue suggests to create a .ts file. This was not done. Only the minimum demonstration is included; a DICOM file is loaded and is used in memory quickly with sktime.\r\nThe issue also mentions a desire for classification / clustering demonstration, yet my understanding is that this would be unnecessary repeat of other sktime tutorials.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to create more relevant and complete code / utilities / examples, yet maybe above is just what needed, as the DICOM format is very flexible and one may be introduced with different settings.\r\n\r\nThis PR can be either merged as is, or can be considered a WIP. Happy for any guidance.\r\nMaybe makes sense to merge this PR and to open new relevant issue(s) to be implemented (by me) in additional increments.\r\n\r\nWKR, Oren.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-05T02:44:22Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T20:02:25Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T20:02:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"125e00e55356f539f1046bf044e84d8d4a7a02fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/d8ac85de1f147cb692da9100a8a748afd5bc82d7","head":{"label":"zbenmo:issue_356_DICOM","ref":"issue_356_DICOM","sha":"d8ac85de1f147cb692da9100a8a748afd5bc82d7","user":{"login":"zbenmo","id":1571438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1571438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo","html_url":"https://github.com/zbenmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":300447542,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDA0NDc1NDI=","name":"sktime","full_name":"zbenmo/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zbenmo","id":1571438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1571438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo","html_url":"https://github.com/zbenmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbenmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zbenmo/sktime","description":"A
