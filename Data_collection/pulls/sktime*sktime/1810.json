Hopefully the definitive fix now.\r\n\r\nThis fix completely rewrites the `FeatureUnion` instead of inheriting from the `sklearn` one.\r\nWith the new transformers refactor, we can simply use `pandas` functionality to merge/concatenate data frames internally, while the framework does the rest.\r\n\r\nMinor complication:\r\nWith the transformer refactor, the \"row-wise transformer\" have become obsolete, since vectorization (to panel) is performed automatically whenever such a data container is encountered.\r\nSome tests not directly related to the `FeatureUnion` but also using `FeatureUnion` were still using them, so I `xfailed` them for the time being, until the `RowTransformer`s are entirely removed, see issue #2179.","created_at":"2021-12-31T12:59:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T21:15:49Z","closed_at":"2022-03-19T21:15:48Z","merged_at":"2022-03-19T21:15:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"42670345623beb8f328e74624f95e754af96692e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1118163262,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTE4MTYzMjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
