This has been carried out for only two instances in this PR since it's tedious. Opened #2255 for doing the rest.\r\n* added multivariate scenario for classifiers. This allows to move the positive case from `test_multivariate_input`, because `test_all_estimators` covers that. Hence, now only the negative (exception raising) case is tested as `test_multivariate_input_exception`.","created_at":"2022-03-19T23:43:37Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T16:45:23Z","closed_at":"2022-03-21T16:45:22Z","merged_at":"2022-03-21T16:45:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffa7dca760b900cfc37b075f9d6cdf815b8fe354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"patrickzib","id":7783034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickzib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickzib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3102418261,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTAyNDE4MjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:classification","name":"module:classification","color":"BEB114","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3137622230,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM3NjIyMjMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:tests","name":"module:tests","color":"43421D","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789327275,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3Iur","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":"Restructuring without changing its external behavior.
