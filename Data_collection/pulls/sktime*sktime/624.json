Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n<!--\r\nExample: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.\r\n\r\nPlease use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests\r\nyou resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request\r\nis merged. \r\n-->\r\nBegun implementing basic sktime clustering algorithms. See issue #501.\r\nAdditionally contains some utils updates to allow for importing of csv to ts dataframes automatically.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\nThis creates a base for future clustering algorithms. NOTE: this is the very very basic idea for clustering algorithms. All of the design decisions are up for discussion. For example the base Cluster class takes a parameter called matric which is meant to be the custom time series distance measure, however, some clustering algorithms will never be able to use this so this is up for debate as how to best present the user with the option to use custom functionality while keeping consistency.\r\n\r\nThe utils functions allow you to take a csv and convert it to a .ts file.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf your contribution does add a new hard dependency, we may suggest to initially develop your contribution in a separate companion package in https://github.com/sktime/ to keep external dependencies of the core sktime package to a minimum.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here -->\r\nThe reviewer should focus on the design. In terms of functionality not much is here it is just the sklearn algorithms with a basic wrapper. What I want to focus on is the design as some of the sklearn parameters as well as clustering algorithms (as they are completly different types of algorithms) make it awkward to make a generic solution to it. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.\r\n-->\r\nI've been investigating how to make a start on making it so the clustering algorithms can use the sktime custom distance measures - the main issue i've come up against is some of the sklearn implementation do not allow for custom distance measure (annoyingly). For example the kmean implementation in sklearn. Sklearn (for some reason) has taken the line that kmeans can't be solved without euclidean (or some other algorithm) and havent allowed for a custom distance measure to be passed as such. Taking a look at how ts learn overcame this they basically just recoded the whole thing which i'd ideally not want to do but it looks like I may have to. Some of the sklearn implementation do allow for custom distance measure so may start with them but if anyone has any idea of a simpler solution for the ones that dont before I recode it would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below. Please feel free to remove points if they are not applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of
