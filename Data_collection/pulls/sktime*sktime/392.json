Explain your changes.\r\n* Support for `pd.DatetimeIndex`, `pd.PeriodIndex` in data and forecasting horizon, including helper functions to patch mathematical operations on pandas date/time objects for our purposes (mostly returning integers for known time unit, rather than time delta objects)\r\n* Included forecasting data sets are now returned with `pd.PeriodIndex`\r\n* Support for absolute forecasting horizon specification via refactored `ForecastingHorizon` class\r\n* Easy importing via `sktime.forecasting.all` module enabling `from sktime.forecasting.all import *` following [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/)\r\n* A few minor changes (typos, formatting, etc)\r\n* Corresponding updates to forecasting notebook\r\n* New unit tests for supported combinations of data index types and forecasting types\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one? \r\n* seaborn (soft dependency, for plotting) \r\n\r\n#### Key files to review \r\nSince the forecasting horizon was used in basically every forecasting algorithm, this PR makes changes to many files. Key changes include:\r\n\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/base/_fh.py` (implementation of forecasting horizon class)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/base/tests/test_fh.py` (unit tests for forecasting horizon class)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/tests/_config.py` (check SUPPORTED_INDEX_FH_COMBINATIONS)\r\n* `sktime/forecasting/tests/test_all_forecasters.py` (unit testing framework for all forecasters)\r\n* `sktime/utils/datetime.py` (date/time helper functions)\r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n* Supporting only `pd.PeriodIndex` and not `pd.DatetimeIndex` would make the code a bit simpler as `pd.DatetimeIndex` requires additional patches to return integers for durations/time deltas and additional type distinctions (dispatch), however it seems like `pd.DatetimeIndex` supports some functionality which is not supported by `pd.PeriodIndex` (e.g. `is_month_end`)\r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\n* refactor `BaseLastWindowForecaster` and reduce inheritance as much as possible","created_at":"2020-09-09T15:41:46Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T19:02:25Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T19:02:24Z","merged_at":"2020-10-02T19:02:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"429a829d229846ff00c43e6019ec4e60024a8627","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
