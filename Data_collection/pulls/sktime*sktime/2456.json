This is fixed.\r\n* an error in the forecasting pipelines constructor check that would consider another forecasting pipeline as type-less and hence raise an error, because forecasting pipelines were expected to be constructed with transformers or forecasters. This is fixed by changing the default behaviour of `scitype` to what was assumed (just one type is returned).\r\n* Since the `scitype` would come back empty for the `TransformedTargetForecaster`, no scenarios would be found in testing, because retrieval was based on the `scitype` utility. Now, with the change, scenarios are retrieved, and more tests are run, which (without fix) would fail, since tests for transformers are also run due to the polymorphism. This is remedied by removing transformer inheritance from `TransformedTargetForecaster` for now.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds:\r\n* a test for constructing a nested pipeline to ensure the functionality/ability of nesting pipelines does not get broken in the future.\r\n* functionality to the `scitypes` function that forces it to return only a single scitype. Ties are resolved by the order in which the scitypes appear in the register, which prefers forecasters above transformers. This is enabled by default, as it was assumed by all references.","created_at":"2022-04-13T18:52:26Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T16:37:17Z","closed_at":"2022-04-28T16:37:16Z","merged_at":"2022-04-28T16:37:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b6a9416aad3e975059e2728ebfaef9c5abd3503","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3745673790,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7fQnI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:datatypes","name":"module:datatypes","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
