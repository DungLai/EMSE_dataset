Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nUpdated `.binder/requirements.txt` so that binder-build finishes successfully. Have tested this by using `https://mybinder.org/` to build from my fork.\r\n\r\nThe changed requirement for `tsfresh` avoids an attempt to install `numpy-1.20.1` which is incompatible with `python 3.6` installed on binder and causes failed build. Extra line to address separate issue around `llvm` (see below).\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\n`llvm-lite-0.16.0` is the default version installed on Binder. Including the extra line avoids a doomed re-installation attempt out of the `/.binder` subfolder, where a certain `llvm-config` can't be found. Later in the build process, `llvm-lite` is successfully updated to `0.35.0`, presumably because the path to `llvm-config` works from the main directory.\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nThis is my first pull request, so any feedback is very welcome!\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/.all-contributorsrc).\r\n- [ ] Optionally, I've updated sktime's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [ ] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-15T04:05:09Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T11:36:32Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T11:36:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54893c42af184861962c79a7444c35a17369e116","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/743c574ed0de54380a2c636c1b461472cd31286f","head":{"label":"ddorf:binder-build-fix","ref":"binder-build-fix","sha":"743c574ed0de54380a2c636c1b461472cd31286f","user":{"login":"ddorf","id":28767641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzY3NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28767641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf","html_url":"https://github.com/ddorf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":347822879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDc4MjI4Nzk=","name":"sktime","full_name":"ddorf/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ddorf","id":28767641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzY3NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28767641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf","html_url":"https://github.com/ddorf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ddorf/sktime","description":"A
