Right now, the aforementioned implicit conventions are too many and intricate to write useful extension guidelines, in my opinion.\r\n* extending to the multivariate case\r\n* input/output checks and the eternal data container discussion, this can go in the plumbing\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept regarding ease of extension, this PR also contains a highly annotated extension template in the `extension_templates` folder.\r\n\r\nIn terms of review, the key file is `forecasting/base/_base`, with corresponding changes (contraction and deletion) in `base/_sktime`.\r\n\r\nI've tried to keep the interface consistent as much as possible (only changing internal logic).\r\n\r\nInterface contracts with all the earlier estimators are still honoured, via loopthroughs and default behaviour that ensures that everything still works if `fit`, `predict` etc are overridden by the current descendants, as opposed to `_fit` and `_predict`.\r\nThe only change I had to made to descendants is set `self._is_fitted=False` at the start of `fit`, which is a minimally invasive change that's also separately reviewable as PR #941.\r\n\r\nThere should only be a single change that breaks the tagging/inspection interface, which is replacing the choice of which forecasting horizon mixin one inherits from with a choice of the new `fh_in_fit` tag (can be `'requried'` or `'optional'`).\r\nTemporarily, I've left both mixins and the `_SktimeForecaster` in and handled their behaviour as expected (inheriting from a mixin sets the `fh_in_fit` tag), so existing classes should still run, unless there is interface inconsistency or bugs in my refactor. Mid-term, we may want to remove the fh-mixins and `_SktimeForecaster` in favour of a single `BaseForecaster` class.","created_at":"2021-05-30T00:12:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-12T23:57:03Z","closed_at":"2021-06-12T18:40:00Z","merged_at":"2021-06-12T18:39:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad82a2792b792c6357c8c0db815772bae04c86c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"big-o","id":1134151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o","html_url":"https://github.com/big-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/febbf42782060c9880f953d5a4d8925f4859851e","head":{"label":"sktime:forecast-base-refactor","ref":"forecast-base-refactor","sha":"febbf42782060c9880f953d5a4d8925f4859851e","user":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156401841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY0MDE4NDE=","name":"sktime","full_name":"sktime/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sktime","id":56396127,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Mzk2MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56396127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime","html_url":"https://github.com/sktime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sktime/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sktime/sktime","description":"A
