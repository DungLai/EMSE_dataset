Explain your changes.\r\nHelps to make the code less confusing for the users and lets them set values in a more intuitive and direct manner. This PR lays the groundwork for the planned deprecation of `start_with_window` in `ExpandingWindowSplitter`. The tasks this PR seeks to realize are:\r\n\r\n1. provide users the ability to set initial_window to 0 _and have it actually be set to 0_\r\n2. displays a new `FutureWarning` message prompted when the user sets the default for `start_with_window` to be `False` instead of the default value which is `True`. This way we can warn our users about the coming change and allow them time to make the necessary changes.","created_at":"2022-05-24T06:17:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T15:22:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6561c65728a32549811c42afe045c14f290a7f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/2689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/issues/2689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/statuses/2e1444c0ca0f0dc68c78c88e8c6cab004b4ed845","head":{"label":"mojo-py:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"2e1444c0ca0f0dc68c78c88e8c6cab004b4ed845","user":{"login":"mojo-py","id":84004324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDA0MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84004324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py","html_url":"https://github.com/mojo-py","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":495673988,"node_id":"R_kgDOHYtihA","name":"sktime","full_name":"mojo-py/sktime","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mojo-py","id":84004324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDA0MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84004324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py","html_url":"https://github.com/mojo-py","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojo-py/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mojo-py/sktime","description":"A
