Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nRelated to #434 and functionality requested by @TonyBagnall \r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nI have implemented a function to allow for the reading of .csv files containing long-formatted data. It checks that the data is of the assumed format to be converted to an sktime usable format. I have also implemented some testing to ensure that it correctly reads the csv, and the format checks work.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency?
