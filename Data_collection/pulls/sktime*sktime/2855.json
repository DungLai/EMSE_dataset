The viterbi algorithm gets to treat those as a black box. \r\n    - the hope here is that we can add some functionality which automatically generates some nice functions for people if needed (ie give me an n-dimensional gaussian!), but it also gives the flexibility to do more interesting things!  - Have an empirical distribution you want to act as a \"pdf\"?  Have some other distribution you are getting from some other system that you would like to use? As long as it can return a valid probability then it *should* work with our HMM estimator, no need to write your own!\r\n- I have spent some time optimizing the algorithms with numpy (in particular, the `_calculate_trans_mats` function which is the slowest part), the plan is to push this a bit more and then conduct speed tests between this draft estimator and `hmmlearn`, so we can have a more quantitative comparison of speed. \r\n- I implemented a very simple version of a base object, named `SimpleBaseEstimator` and used that here.  It is very similar to what Lukasz did in his annotation flavored PR actually, just added in the `get_params()` and `set_params()` functions, which are technically required for it to be a sklearn like estimator. \r\n    - I am not proposing we replace our Base Object with what I wrote at all, just wanted to see how many of the bells and whistles in Base Estimator I could get away without! Again - just for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example of how to use it: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sktime.annotation.hmm import HMM\r\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\r\nfrom numpy import asarray\r\n\r\ncenters = [3.5,-5]\r\nsd = [.25 for i in centers]\r\nemi_funcs = [(norm.pdf, {'loc': mean, 'scale': sd[ind]}) for ind, mean in enumerate(centers)]\r\n\r\ntest = HMM(emi_funcs, asarray([[0.25,0.75], [0.666, 0.333]]))\r\nobs = asarray([3.7,3.2,3.4,3.6,-5.1,-5.2,-4.9])\r\ntest.fit(obs)\r\nprint(test.predict())\r\n```\r\n\r\n<\\details>\r\n\r\n@fkiraly, @lmmentel,
