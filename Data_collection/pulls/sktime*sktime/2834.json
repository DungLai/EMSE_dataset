More changes are necessary, but I would prefer to break the change into smaller logically complete PRs.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nFollowing this conversation: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2694#issuecomment-1146769665, and [this enhancement proposal](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/steps/17_forecasting_horizon_freq/step.md#2a-earlies-possible-pass-in-constructor), I added a new optional argument `freq` to the constructor of `ForecastingHorizon`.\r\n\r\nFrequency is inferred in `ForecastingHorizon` methods indirectly, via the forecaster's `cutoff` passed to methods. In all uses, this is equal to the `cutoff` of the forecaster, which is the last time index of `y` seen in `fit`. This currently carries the `freq` for all cases of time-like indexing, but will lose it after deprecation, since single time indices will no longer carry `freq`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR frequency is passed directly upon construction or via the setter method. Cutoff is no longer used as a source of frequency information.\r\n\r\nThe biggest consequence of this design update is necessity to pass frequency to the `ForecastingHorizon` at some point for the forecasters to preserve their behavior. The minimal code change is to assign frequency via setter method to already existing `fh` in a few of `sktime.forecasting.base._base.BaseForecaster` methods. Frequency is obtained from `y` passed to `fit`, `predict`, and other public methods of this base class.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development.
