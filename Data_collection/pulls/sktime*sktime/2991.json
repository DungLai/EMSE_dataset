Explain your changes.\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of what you have implemented.\r\n-->\r\n- [ ] Moving the `convert_y_to_keras` function in `BaseDeepClassifier` into a utils function\r\n- [x] Enable returning the `label_encoder` and `one hot encoder` to the user from `convert_y_to_keras` (it can be useful for the users in case they want to use it to encode other data / or to decode data later on)\r\n- [x] Add option to have multiple linear layers in output layer / different activation function. Also add the `use_bias` parameter to output layer. (simply as a customisation option to users, multiple linear layers are useful to create deeper networks depending on dataset / choice of activation function)\r\n- [x] option to choose optimiser (usually its Adam but just for customisation's sake we can give this as option as well). Also should allow specifying `lr` either within the optimiser or as parameter to the class itself.\r\n- [x] Accept parameter as input in `CNNClassifier` to specify `random seed`\r\n- [ ] Train/fit the model on GPU depending on users choice (maybe take an input parameter for this as well)\r\n- [x] Option to view / return the loss of fit (either as a graph or simply as a list / array )\r\n\r\n##### For all contributions\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], or [BUG] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, or bug.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
