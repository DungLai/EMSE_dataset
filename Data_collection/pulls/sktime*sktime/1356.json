Explain your changes.\r\nThis is a first draft.\r\n\r\nIntroduce method to generate dummy calender features\r\nWill automatically generate flexible number of features based on the frequency of the series (provided as argument) and the complexity argument (ranges from 0 to 2) to represent few, many or all features.\r\n\r\n#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?\r\n\r\nScope of extractors, logic of complexity arguments\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nCould not finalize Fourier Extractor before my vacation (in 2 weeks will continue on that).\r\n\r\n#### PR checklist\r\n<!--\r\nPlease go through the checklist below.

[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.\r\n- [X] I've added unit tests and made sure they pass locally.\r\n\r\n##### For new estimators\r\n- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online documentation.\r\n- [ ] I've updated the existing example notebooks or provided a new one to showcase how my estimator works.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for
