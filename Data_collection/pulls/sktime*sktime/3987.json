The fix is ensuring that the `X` in predict always has columns in the same order as in `fit`.\r\n\r\nProbably, we should ensure that all estimators can deal with permuted columns by coercing in the base class, but that's a separate topic.","created_at":"2022-12-23T12:35:31Z","updated_at":"2022-12-30T14:09:09Z","closed_at":"2022-12-30T14:09:08Z","merged_at":"2022-12-30T14:09:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"731c2dbf99e035a26ea085917ae6f5e9756988a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GuzalBulatova","id":73598322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTk4MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73598322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzalBulatova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzalBulatova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3105906374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTA1OTA2Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/module:forecasting","name":"module:forecasting","color":"35FCCE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3789332481,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCVKAsc7h3KAB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/bugfix","name":"bugfix","color":"CE54AC","default":false,"description":"Fixes
