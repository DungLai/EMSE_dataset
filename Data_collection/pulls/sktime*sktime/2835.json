The reason for that is that `sklearn`'s test would overwrite parameters with `np.inf` etc to mimic a change, which is fine in `sklearn` since it strictly has no logic in `__init__`. However, `sktime` estimators may have logic, such as dynamic tag setting, which therefore would break the `set_params` now identical with `__init__`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `test_set_params` test was changed from overwriting with `np.inf` etc, to overwriting with values from other test cases as available through `get_test_params` and `get_param_defaults` (needed for full set), which ensures validity.","created_at":"2022-06-20T12:57:34Z","updated_at":"2022-06-28T18:53:33Z","closed_at":"2022-06-28T18:53:32Z","merged_at":"2022-06-28T18:53:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"d77d1e8fc3cb8b206a5f2e5ed1ccebc6ed2a4add","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TonyBagnall","id":9594042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTQwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9594042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall","html_url":"https://github.com/TonyBagnall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TonyBagnall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"aiwalter","id":29627036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjI3MDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29627036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/aiwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1180366006,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgwMzY2MDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sktime/sktime/labels/implementing%20framework","name":"implementing
