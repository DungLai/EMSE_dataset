In my real-world example rank=1, dim=2369, and batch_shape=(1343,), so the space reduction is 30GB â†’ 13MB.\r\n\r\nComputations is cheap in this representation: addition amounts to concatenation, and plate-reduction amounts to transpose and reshape.  Some ops are only supported on full-rank Gaussians, and I've added checks based on the new property `.is_full_rank`.  This partial support is ok because the Gaussian funsors that arise in Bayesian models are all full rank due to priors (notwithstanding numerical loss of rank).\r\n\r\nBecause the Gaussian funsor is internal, the interface change should not cause breakage of most user code, since most user code uses `to_funsor()` and `to_data()` with backend-specific distributions.  One broken piece of user code is Pyro's [AutoGaussianFunsor](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/ac3c588c7e18a695000f87322e037d31ad2900e5/pyro/infer/autoguide/gaussian.py#L434-L436) which will need an update (and which will be sped up).\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @eb8680, I've added some optional kwarg parametrizations and properties to support conversion to other Gaussian representations, e.g. `g = Gaussian(mean=..., covariance=..., inputs=...)` and `g._mean`, `g._covariance`.  This allows more Gaussian math to live in gaussian.py.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] added new tests\r\n- [x] pass existing funsor tests (linear algebra)\r\n- [x] pass existing funsor tests (patterns)\r\n- [x] pass NumPyro tests (conjugacy)\r\n- [x] pass Pyro tests on a branch (https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2943)\r\n- [x] check computational cost on the pyro-cov model (results: under 12GB memory)","created_at":"2021-10-07T03:52:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T14:39:05Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T14:39:04Z","merged_at":"2021-10-18T14:39:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"c94a9bd79d8ce7c441957f2e376b11bd490b0d6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
