In particular, there is a mismatch between `y.output`, which is `Reals[3]` and the `.output` value `Real` expected for the `loc` param of `funsor.torch.distributions.Normal` given by `funsor.distribution.Distribution._infer_value_domain`.\r\n\r\nIn cases like the above, however, it is always possible to infer the correct parameter and value `.output` shapes generically using the broadcasting logic in the underlying backend distribution.  This PR implements this behavior in `funsor.distribution.DistributionMeta.__call__` and `distribution_to_data`.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, it is possible after this PR to represent `Independent` distributions without an intermediary `funsor.Independent` by passing a `Variable` with extra output dimensions as the `value`:\r\n```py\r\n# diagonal multivariate normal in pyro:\r\ndist.Normal(zeros(3), 1.).to_event(1)\r\n\r\n# funsor equivalent, after this PR - note Reals[3] for x\r\nNormal(loc=zeros(3), scale=1., value=Variable(\"x\", Reals[3]))\r\n```\r\nThis should considerably simplify pattern-matching over `Independent` distributions.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, converting a `funsor.distribution.Distribution` to data via `funsor.to_data` will have to include a step handling nontrivial event shapes by calling `.to_event` and unsqueezing parameters.\r\n\r\nMore ambitiously, we could also attempt to handle `to_funsor` conversion of backend `Independent` distributions by substituting an appropriately shaped `Variable` for their value rather than resorting to lazy application of `funsor.terms.Independent`, which would make pattern-matching for `collapse`ing multivariate distributions much easier, but it's not clear yet whether this can be done generically, especially in the presence of transforms.  I have not attempted to do this in this PR.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Update `funsor.distribution.DistributionMeta`\r\n- [x] Update `distribution_to_data`\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Fix
