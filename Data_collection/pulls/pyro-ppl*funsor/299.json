It accepts an additional argument `num_segments`, chops up `trans` into `num_segments` contiguous segments of equal length, and performs left-to-right elimination via `naive_sequential_sum_product` on those segments, then `Stack`s the results and performs parallel-scan elimination on the remaining internal variables.\r\n\r\nWhen `num_segments == duration`, this reduces to `sequential_sum_product`; when `num_segments == 1`, this reduces to `naive_sequential_sum_product`.\r\n\r\nThis operation becomes more interesting when `trans` has some internal structure, e.g. when it is a lazy expression produced by `sarkka_bilmes_product`.  Eliminating some variables left-to-right initially can save some memory and potentially unnecessary computation, at the expense of parallelism.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Added to `sequential_sum_product` tests in `test_sum_product.py`\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-07T23:42:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T08:35:04Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T08:35:02Z","merged_at":"2020-01-08T08:35:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a60350ae3f4fbf504bd018305f0f35c8d96733d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
