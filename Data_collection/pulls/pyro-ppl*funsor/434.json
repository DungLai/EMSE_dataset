I am somewhat skeptical about taking that additional step because of how difficult it is to interact with `typing.Generic` at runtime, and have chosen in this PR to retain a simplified version of the `GenericTypeMeta` class as a substrate for `Funsor` and `FunsorMeta`.\r\n\r\nOne critical question for this approach is how well the `multipledispatch` fork holds up in terms of correctness and performance and how much additional maintenance effort it would entail.  In an ideal world, someone else would implement a performant, fully `typing`-compatible `multipledispatch` completely independent of Funsor and we could just use their solution, since that's clearly a useful and interesting direction in its own right and there are a number of new runtime type checkers ([1](https://github.com/erezsh/runtype), [2](https://github.com/beartype/beartype)) that could be repurposed to support it.\r\n\r\nHowever, since that is unlikely (AFAIK) in the near term and the developers of `multipledispatch` are not interested in merging the `pytypes`-based version (which I took and lightly modified from [an old pull request there](https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch/pull/69)), we'd have to maintain the fork ourselves.  The core functionality seems to be largely complete - almost all of the multipledispatch and Funsor tests pass locally, and pytypes itself is extensively tested.  We might need to add a dedicated `typing`-compatible `Dispatcher` upon which to base `funsor.ops.Op` and `funsor.registry.KeyedRegistry` that makes sure signatures use `typing` syntax, e.g. converting tuples to `typing.Union`s or `object` to `typing.Any`.  As for performance, running tests locally shows there is definitely a slowdown relative to the current `multipledispatch`, although it's much less severe than the discussion in that `multipledispatch` PR would suggest.\r\n\r\nAnother practical issue is the compatibility of `pytypes` with various Python versions, especially 3.7-3.9.  It seems like that's been addressed to a large extent in their `master` branch, at least for the subset of `typing` we would use in Funsor, but I'm not entirely sure what its status is or when any outstanding issues might be resolved.\r\n\r\nI am cautiously optimistic about these questions, but it's too early to say right now whether they'd end up being show-stoppers relative to the status quo or the simpler approach in #433.","created_at":"2021-01-20T05:28:48Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T19:41:00Z","closed_at":"2021-02-02T19:40:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"730d305715616ebe2eb4b600124c41ea6d3b7675","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1262045842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjYyMDQ1ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/statuses/5b98eba1e722195881839960c1044dec4bc32db8","head":{"label":"pyro-ppl:generic-type-meta-pytypes","ref":"generic-type-meta-pytypes","sha":"5b98eba1e722195881839960c1044dec4bc32db8","user":{"login":"pyro-ppl","id":46794900,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2Nzk0OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46794900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168430006,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg0MzAwMDY=","name":"funsor","full_name":"pyro-ppl/funsor","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pyro-ppl","id":46794900,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2Nzk0OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46794900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor","description":"Functional
