This aims to be maximally general and should be able to be integrated into the TVE algorithm `partial_sum_product()` (as in the [convolve-method branch](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/compare/convolve-method?expand=1)).\r\n\r\n## Design Questions\r\n- [ ] What problem class should we address? E.g. should this assume that the components have already been decomposed by a connected components algorithm? I've started to enumerate test cases, and I think we should spend a many hours whiteboarding examples to understand the problem class (as we did with TVE).\r\n- [ ] How can we pass around the metadata of time lags? This PR attempts to do so via name mangling of `.inputs.keys()`, but that approach won't currently work because alpha binding mangles names in a different way. Indeed the alpha mangling appears to thwart other nearby designs such as passing in a side-information dict indicating which names correspond to which lags. One possible solution is to make alpha renaming less intrusive. @eb8680 can you think about possible solutions?","created_at":"2019-07-24T17:21:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T19:40:02Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T19:40:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84ec00b8ac87f70b5cfada07e1a92f454255a763","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"martinjankowiak","id":22105218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTA1MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22105218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak","html_url":"https://github.com/martinjankowiak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinjankowiak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847976,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3OTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/WIP","name":"WIP","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1262045842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjYyMDQ1ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/statuses/a7214e72e25c41da761016d644ac994b6e79114b","head":{"label":"pyro-ppl:markov-sum-product","ref":"markov-sum-product","sha":"a7214e72e25c41da761016d644ac994b6e79114b","user":{"login":"pyro-ppl","id":46794900,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2Nzk0OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46794900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168430006,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg0MzAwMDY=","name":"funsor","full_name":"pyro-ppl/funsor","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pyro-ppl","id":46794900,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2Nzk0OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46794900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl","html_url":"https://github.com/pyro-ppl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyro-ppl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyr
