Adds a property `Funsor.__annotations__` to support `typing.get_type_hints`. In this PR, `__annotations__` is computed from `.inputs`, `.output`; in the future we may want to reverse the dependency?\r\n\r\nIn particular this PR illuminates a path towards generalizing funsor types from `Union[Real[shape], Bint[size]]` to more general PyTree-like types including nested `Tuple`s.\r\n\r\nRegarding @eb8680's [question 4](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/351#issuecomment-674467968), `to_funsor` does not yet interpret a callable as either `@function` or `@symbolic`. It is an open design question which of these should be called.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [x] updated distribution tests to use the new
