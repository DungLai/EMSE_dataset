Supercedes #433, #434. Would unblock #423, although it might be easier to fix that independently.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a self-contained `funsor.typing` module for runtime dispatch and typechecking of parametric types, especially Funsor term types.\r\n\r\nIt contains three distinct pieces of functionality extracted from `FunsorMeta`:\r\n1. Replacements for `type`, `isinstance` and `issubclass` that are compatible with a limited subset of Funsor/`typing`-style generic types, including Funsor terms, `typing.Tuple`s and `typing.FrozenSet`s, mimicking similar APIs in `pytypes` (albeit with much less coverage of `typing`).\r\n2. A new metaclass `funsor.typing.GenericTypeMeta` whose purpose is to support parametric subtyping, handle cons-hashing of parametric types and support runtime `issubclass` checks, and a minimal introspection API matching `typing`'s `get_args`/`get_origin`/`get_type_hints`.\r\n3. A `multipledispatch.dispatcher.Dispatcher` subclass that is capable of making use of this new functionality and is used by all Funsor `dispatched_interpretation`s via `funsor.registry.KeyedRegistry`\r\n\r\nI have also refactored and drastically simplified `FunsorMeta` using this machinery. In a followup PR I will do the same for `funsor.domains.ArrayType`.\r\n\r\n### Context \r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it should be possible to use some of the Python standard `typing` library directly when describing funsor input and output types or when writing patterns, e.g. we could simply replace `Product` from #430 with `typing.Tuple`:\r\n```py\r\nclass Tuple(Funsor):\r\n    def __init__(self, args):\r\n        ...\r\n        output = typing.Tuple[tuple(arg.output for arg in args)]\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n...or use `typing.Tuple`, including variadic cases, in patterns like the ones needed for `Finitary` in #423:\r\n```py\r\n@eager.register(Finitary)\r\ndef eager_finitary_generic(\r\n        op: EinsumOp, \r\n        args: typing.Tuple[typing.Union[Tensor, Number], ...]  # variadic\r\n    ) -> typing.Union[Tensor, Number]:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nAs suggested in #355, we could even replace many of the assertions in our `Funsor.__init__` methods with runtime type checking in interpreters, eliminating lots of boilerplate code and potentially boosting performance (by making many assertions optional):\r\n```py\r\nclass FunsorMeta(type):\r\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        ...\r\n        if interpreter.TYPECHECK:\r\n            assert all(isinstance(arg, static_arg_type)\r\n                        for arg, static_arg_type in zip(args, get_type_hints(cls.__init__)))\r\n        return interpret(cls, *args)\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\n# example\r\nclass Reduce(Funsor):\r\n-     def __init__(self, op, arg, reduced_vars):\r\n+     def __init__(self, op: ops.AssociativeOp, arg: Funsor, reduced_vars: typing.FrozenSet[Variable]):\r\n-         assert callable(op)\r\n-         assert isinstance(arg, Funsor)\r\n-         assert isinstance(reduced_vars, frozenset)\r\n-         assert all(isinstance(v, Variable) for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          reduced_names = frozenset(v.name for v in reduced_vars)\r\n          ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn #355 I had originally suggested going even further toward integrating `typing` with Funsor interpretations than the changes here by making parametric `Funsor` subtypes use `typing.Generic`.  I am somewhat skeptical about taking that additional step because of how difficult it is to interact with `typing.Generic` at runtime, and have chosen in this PR to retain a simplified version of the `GenericTypeMeta` class as a substrate for `Funsor` and `FunsorMeta`.\r\n\r\n### Tested\r\n- Exercised by all existing tests that use interpretations\r\n\r\n### Remaining tasks\r\n- [x] Resolve any `typing`-related dependency issues for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\r\n- [x] Move the existing `issubclass` tests in `test_terms.py` to a new file `test_typing.py`\r\n- [x] Add more standalone tests to `test_typing.py`\r\n- [x] Add more documentation\r\n\r\n### Triaged\r\n- Investigate performance regressions with the new `Dispatcher` and `FunsorMeta` implementations - this appears to be less severe than originally feared, so I am OK with addressing performance in future PRs unless there's a really easy fix.","created_at":"2021-02-02T20:42:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T18:36:52Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T18:36:51Z","merged_at":"2021-02-22T18:36:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5b3556c78251ec372a90af2f7f5cf135afd89ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1215006862,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE1MDA2ODYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"0e8a16","default":true,"description":"New
