This change should enable nested `Product`s and simplify the process of adding new `Product`/`tuple`-like `Domain`s (i.e. with the same variance as `Product`).\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this PR represents a minimal first attempt to bring both interpreter types and funsor types closer to the Python `typing` type system, thereby saving us work, reducing cognitive overhead for users who are familiar with `typing`, and  approaching compatibility with some of the wider tooling ecosystem built around `typing`.  It may turn out that these potential advantages are outweighed by design choices in `typing` or `multipledispatch`, or that bugs, edge cases or performance limit the feasibility of this direction in practice, but it's hard to know without trying.\r\n\r\nI will also put up a different version of these changes that integrates with `typing` more directly in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n-
