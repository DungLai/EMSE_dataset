After this PR, `dist.Normal(0,1)` remains an inspectable `Normal` distribution until its value is substituted (possibly for another variable), e.g. in the second line above.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of this PR include:\r\n1. We can avoid some computation (currently not even implemented, and inevitable numerically unstable) in pyro observe statements whose parameters are delayed variables, since a large (rank deficient) Gaussian will never be constructed. Instead we will wait until an observation is available as in the above example elbo computation.\r\n2. Pyro statements will be a little more debuggable since the original distribution will be available.\r\n\r\nThis may seem a little gross, but I see it as a way for funsor.distributions to be used in both older pyro-style and newer funsor-style with no conflict (e.g. no funsor.compat.distributions shim).\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- [x] Should we instead simply disallow specifying the variate in the `__init__` method?\r\n    This way all distributions would be lazily constructed, and could be converted to e.g. `Gaussian` or `Joint` by substitution of `variable`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- updated existing tests\r\n- added a new delta check\r\n- ran in `pyro/examples/minipyro.py
