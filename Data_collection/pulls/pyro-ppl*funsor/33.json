To support symbolic expressions this resurrects a limited version of `materialize()`. This PR does implement substitution of vector indices; as @neerajprad points out, it is still unclear whether vector indices are useful.\r\n\r\nThis PR also demotes the `Arange` class to a simpler `arange` function.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- [x] fix previously xfailing unit test\r\n- [x] unit test substituting multiple tensors into a tensor\r\n- [x] unit test with nontrivial output shape\r\n-
