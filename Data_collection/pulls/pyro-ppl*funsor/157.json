A `Contraction` term representing finitary sum-product operations that takes advantage of `multipledispatch.Variadic` for pattern matching.  This is also necessary for #72.\r\n2. A `normalize` interpretation that uses associative and distributive properties to put linear expressions into something like DNF, grouping operations into single `Contraction` terms where possible.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration, I have included patterns and tests illustrating how `Joint` is equivalent to interleaving `eager` and `normalize`.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- I copied smoke tests and test cases verbatim from `test_joint.py`, `test_gaussian.py`, `test_affine.py` and `test_einsum.py`","created_at":"2019-07-13T23:45:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T19:50:21Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T19:50:21Z","merged_at":"2019-09-17T19:50:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"955e9cf7d09e6f71701d8c2143eb34d353fb9804","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
