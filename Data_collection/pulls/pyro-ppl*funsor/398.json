attempts to generalize `partial_sum_product` to support elimination of markov variables following discussion with @eb8680 and @fritzo at pyro-ppl/pyro#2687.\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n- [x] `modified_partial_sum_product` that eliminates first-order markov variables using parallel-scan algorithm.\r\n- [x] Add more tests\r\n- [ ] <s>Rename `modified_partial_sum_product` or replace `partial_sum_product` by it?</s>\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n- [x] `_expected_modified_partial_sum_product` unrolls one markov  dim at a time\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_0`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_1`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_2`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_3`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_4`\r\n- [x]

`test_modified_partial_sum_product_14`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_15`: xfail `y` depends on two time dims `time` and `tones`\r\n- [x] `test_modified_partial_sum_product_16`: `x_prev->y_curr` and `y_prev->x_curr`\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n- Markov sites cannot be within local plates inside (see tests 2 and 10)\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n- Added unrolling of markov vars in local plates
