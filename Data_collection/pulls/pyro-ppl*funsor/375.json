I had to make a couple of changes to the interpreter logic to get this working:\r\n1. Have `interpreter.interpretation` yield its input\r\n2. Add an option to disable interpreter stacking in `interpretation`, which was enabled by default in #369 \r\n\r\nThe second change was necessary to avoid a memory blowup caused by an interpreter being stacked with itself. It suggests the need for more tinkering with interpreter design to address a number of cases including `memoize` and `AdjointTape` where an interpretation invokes the previously active interpretation and does something with the result.","created_at":"2020-10-02T18:11:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T01:52:25Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T01:52:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1f36c1b54719b8ee3836de9abc6159c96f4fdfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847712,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20response","name":"awaiting
