This PR also switches from `torch.inverse()` to more numerically stable Cholesky-based inverse and solve operations.\r\n\r\n@fehiepsi I have chosen to leave the `0.5 * n * log(2 * pi)` factor out of the log normalizer in this PR, which makes `Gaussian`s closed under addition and leads to convenient identity `âˆ€g:Gaussian, g(0) == 0`. Note that normalizing factors are accounted for in to-funsor conversion, e.g. in `funsor.distributions` and `funsor.pyro.convert.mvn_to_funsor()`.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\nI am fairly confident that this PR is correct, given our good test coverage.\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- added a test for the new invariant `g(0) = 0`\r\n- added unit tests for `cholesky_solve` and `cholesky_inverse`","created_at":"2019-08-05T14:00:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T20:57:24Z","closed_at":"2019-08-06T20:27:51Z","merged_at":"2019-08-06T20:27:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a503bae9bd355097756dc7f4656d411e8388962","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
