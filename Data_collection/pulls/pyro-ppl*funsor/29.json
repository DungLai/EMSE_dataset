Makes `Function` closed under substitution, following the pattern of `Distribution` objects.\r\n2. Drops lazy `Substitution` objects and the global `eager_subs` function.\r\n3. Updates `Tensor` and `Stack` to raise `NotImplementedError('TODO implement advanced indexing')`\r\n4. Adds a check in `Tensor` to ensure tensors cannot depend on real free variables. (We may later create something like a `Branch(Tensor(...))` when substituting a real-dependency into a `Tensor`, but that requires more thinking).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- updated an existing unit
