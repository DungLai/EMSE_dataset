This required:\r\n- supporting `Gaussian` and `Joint` in our ad-hoc `Cat` funsor\r\n- adding a `Joint.align()` method\r\n- fixing typos in `sequential_sum_product()` (as @eb8680 and I noticed offline)\r\n\r\nNote this means we can now implement asymptotically fast Kalman filter learning with funsor. (Provisos include: (1) only for full-rank observation distributions, (2) fast asymptotically, but with a big constant factor due to our broadcast-multiply-reduce implementation of gaussian_gemm).\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added a grid of normal and multivariate normal tests to test_sum_product.py","created_at":"2019-07-25T22:55:17Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T19:02:27Z","closed_at":"2019-07-26T18:57:59Z","merged_at":"2019-07-26T18:57:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9fd622709103126ca9a400bb1f87c988007b4623","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
