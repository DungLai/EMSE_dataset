It is similar to #319 except that it does not change the `funsor.distributions` API and does not contain new `to_funsor`/`to_data` logic.\r\n\r\nNecessary to support the broader refactoring around funsor integration and backend independence in https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2307.  In particular, this PR is a prerequisite for Funsor support in NumPyro.","created_at":"2020-03-03T22:37:30Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T03:57:10Z","closed_at":"2020-03-25T22:11:39Z","merged_at":"2020-03-25T22:11:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"69ea45ae300c5e9e42c304a7ce43fc1ab26758c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
