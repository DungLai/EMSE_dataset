The function is accessed by `interpreter.interpret()` and `funsor.eval()` is renamed to `interpreter.reinterpret()`.\r\n- Implement three interpretations by default: `eager`, `lazy` (for lazy ops but eager substitution), and `reflect` (completely lazy).\r\n- Delete everything not essential to basic design goals: bracket indexing, Align, Branch, simplification, obsolete engines, pattern matching, ...\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] add funsor.domains\r\n- [x] add funsor.interpretations\r\n- [x] update funsor.terms\r\n- [x] update funsor.torch\r\n- [x] delete funsor.contract etc.\r\n- [x] update
