The approach is to first perform symbolic computations among Funsors, then lower to simple Funsor expressions, then compile the lowered Funsor expression to a straight-line program involving only backend ops, then optionally convert to Python code. The final program depends only on `funsor.ops`. This eliminates interpreter overhead, but does not eliminate op dispatch overhead.\r\n\r\nThe immediate application is to speed up Pyro's `AutoGaussian` guide https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2929, but this will also require symbolic Gaussians #556.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] compile lowered funsors to Funsor-free programs\r\n- [x] lower `Contraction` to `Binary`\r\n- [x] trace simple op graphs\r\n- [x] support tuples in `compile_function()` for functions with multiple outputs (e.g. forward filter backward precondition).\r\n\r\n## Tasks deferred to follow-up PRs\r\n- lower bound variables, maybe via `Lambda` or `ops.einsum`? E.g. to eliminate the bound variable `i`:\r\n    ```py\r\n    Variable(\"f\", Reals[3])[\"i\"].reduce(ops.add, \"i\")  ‚ü∂  Variable(\"f\", Reals[3]).sum(0)\r\n    ```\r\n- fix contraction to use `funsor.ops` internally (not `opt_einsum` with direct backends), or make `opt_einsum` an op or sth\r\n- fix Gaussian to use `funsor.ops` internally\r\n- support tuples in `trace_function()` to support multiple outputs\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit tests for `compile_funsor()`\r\n- [x] unit tests for `trace_function()`","created_at":"2021-09-26T04:16:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T16:24:12Z","closed_at":"2021-10-04T16:24:11Z","merged_at":"2021-10-04T16:24:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbb29891b94e834d38776f6f62f08752722f37be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
