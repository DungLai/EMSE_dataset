This is a step in the direction of performing more underlying math on Funsors and less on torch.Tensors, addressing #207 .\r\n\r\nThis also adds an `expand=True` kwarg to `align_tensor()` and `align_tensors()`, thereby avoiding an error-prone `torch.broadcast_tensors()` in subsequent code.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] unit tests for matmul\r\n- [x] refactored to use `x @ y` in some code
