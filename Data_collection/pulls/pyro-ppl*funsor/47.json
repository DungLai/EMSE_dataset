Previously the path produced by `opt_einsum` was being interpreted incorrectly, causing optimized evaluation to evaluate the wrong pairs of contractions and produce exponentially large intermediate results.  As a demonstration, I added some large plated HMM contractions to `test_optimizer.py` that would run out of memory without this fix.","created_at":"2019-03-06T05:17:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T17:40:08Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T17:12:30Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T17:12:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"c47a17f9db2f97d9cda8fc2155cafc73058977eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1215006860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE1MDA2ODYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
