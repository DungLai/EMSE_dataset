Additionally this moves type checking logic from `substitute` down to `SubsMeta` so that type mismatch errors are caught earlier.\r\n\r\nThe `Subs` bugs involve an incorrect definition of `.bound` and incorrect handling of substitution in `._alpha_convert()`. For example this case previously failed:\r\n```py\r\nwith interpretation(reflect):\r\n    Slice('t', 3)(t=Slice('t', 2, dtype=3)).reduce(ops.add)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main `Cat` bug is deeper and involves type mismatch between the axis variable of the component parts (this variable is bound) and the resulting axis variable of the concatenation. Before this PR `Cat` did not bind any variables. After this PR `Cat` has two real variables that can share the same name: a longer `fresh` concatenated variable and a shorter `bound` part variable; only the bound variable is renamed during `._alpha_convert()`; and only the fresh variable is substituted during `.eager_subs()`.\r\n\r\nThe `Slice.eager_subs` bug from #230 involved not preserving `.dtype` information.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n\r\n- [x] refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- [x] made substitution type checking stricter\r\n- [x] added a regression test for `Subs` and `Slice`\r\n- [x] added a regression test for `Cat`\r\n- [x] ran BART example
