After this PR `Bint[size, i,j,k]` denotes a homogeneously-bounded `i x j x k`-sized array of `Bint`. This PR does not yet use those integer valued arrays in distributions or elsewhere; that is for follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also clarifies the role of `Bint`. Whereas I had previously thought we would need heterogeneously-bounded distributions (as e.g. [requested](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/42407) of `dist.Multinomial`), I now believe we can restrict to homogeneously-bounded `Bint` types, and add a separate heterogeneous type `Tuple[Bint[2], Bint[3])` for indexing into arrays. This PR does not add that `Tuple`, but it does clarify the planned type hierarchy:\r\n```\r\nDomain\r\n+-- ArrayType                                 \\\r\n|   +-- RealsType
