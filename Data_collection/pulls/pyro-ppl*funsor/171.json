Further refactorings in #177 should keep these tests passing without modification. In particular this PR hand-codes math that will later be moved into an optimization strategy.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- added lots of comparison with `pyro.distributions.DiscreteHMM` for different batch shapes and observation distributions\r\n- added a unit test for `MaskedDistribution`\r\n- verified that `funsor.pyro.DiscreteHMM` works in pyro/examples/hmm.py.\r\n  Profiling results for `python -O pyro/examples/hmm.py -m 7 -n 100`\r\n  **Pyro:**   6.1 sec\r\n  **Funsor:** 10.9
