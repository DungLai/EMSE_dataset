Right now the numbers in the paper is using random acceleration model.  It also is doing manual sequential sum product rather than GaussianHMM (missing pattern) or `sequential_sum_product()` (todo).  The probabilistic model is\r\n```py\r\nprocess_noise = pyro.param(...)\r\nsensor_noise = pyro.param(...)\r\nbias_scale = pyro.param(...)\r\n\r\nwith plate(\"sensors\", num_sensors):\r\n    bias ~

experiments via `make sensor`.\r\n\r\n~~i didn't include the plotting code which is in a notebook since it clutters the code.~~  @fritzo feel free to push directly to this branch. when this is ready
