#362 \r\n\r\nThis splits the `funsor.ops` module into three submodules:\r\n- `ops.op` for `Op` base classes and registries\r\n- `ops.builtin` for python builtin operations\r\n- `ops.array` for numpy-like array functions  (mostly authored by @fehiepsi)\r\n\r\nThese boundaries are best-effort and will likely change a bit in the future, e.g.\r\n- some numeric ops could be moved between `builtin` and `array`\r\n- I'd prefer to avoid using `numpy` in `ops.builtin`\r\n- some op classes could move from `ops.builtin` to `ops.op`\r\n\r\nThis also slightly changes the `Op` interface to eliminate direct need to use `Dispatcher` for array ops without default behavior; hopefully this will allow increased use of `Op` for pattern matching, but let me know if I've misunderstood.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- built docs
