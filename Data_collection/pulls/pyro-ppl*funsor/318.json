I also take this chance to reorder those ops according to their names (to make it easier to compare different backends or to find some specific implementation).\r\n+ Use `numpy` for default implementation of numeric ops. `funsor.torch` or `funsor.jax` are lazily imported, depending on the environment variable FUNSOR_BACKEND or the usage of `funsor.set_backend(...)`.\r\n+ We can change backend using the utility `set_backend`. There is a problem: if we have change backend to JAX, we can't revert back to `numpy` backend.\r\n+ Port Pyro Tensordot implementation to funsor. Pyro implementation has some statements `x.dim()`, which is not available for ndarray\r\n+ Despite that we will use numpy backend by default, I still use PyTorch names (except for `amax`, `amin`) for those ops (like the current master branch). I guess Pyro devs would like PyTorch names than NumPy names for numeric ops.\r\n\r\nSome small changes:\r\n+ replace `torch._C._get_tracing_state` by `funsor.util.get_tracing_state`\r\n+ add `funsor.util.is_nn_module`\r\n+ add `ops.is_numeric_array` to check if a variable is a numeric array. We can rename it to `ops.is_tensor` to match `torch.is_tensor` if prefered.\r\n+ add `ops.detach` to detach gradient. This is no op for numpy backend.\r\n+ fix issues of `ops.log` which gives warnings at 0. value\r\n+ support both `tuple` or iterator for testing utilities `randn`, `zeros`,... (because I found so many places in test files that use that pattern `torch.zeros(1, 2, 3)` instead of `torch.zeros((1, 2, 3))`).\r\n+ dispatch for `recursion_reinterpret.register(torch.Tensor)` is implemented in `torch.py` file, instead of `interpreter.py` file. (similar for `children`, `to_funsor`, `allclose`)\r\n+ others are cleanup and reordering changes\r\n\r\n### Tests pass with all backends\r\n- [x] test_affine\r\n- [x] test_alpha_conversion\r\n- [x] test_cnf\r\n- [x] test_delta\r\n- [x] test_gaussian\r\n- [x] test_import\r\n- [x] test_integrate\r\n- [x] test_joint\r\n- [x] test_sum_product\r\n- [x] test_tensor\r\n- [x] test_terms\r\n\r\n### Tests only work with torch/pyro\r\n+ `test/pyro/`\r\n+ `test/test_minipyro.py`\r\n+ `test/test_adjoint.py`: requires `einsum.adjoint.require_backward`\r\n+ `test/test_distributions.py`: refactoring\r\n+ `test/test_einsum.py`\r\n+ `test/test_memoize.py`: requires some einsum stuffs\r\n+ `test/test_optimizer.py`: require distributions and einsum\r\n\r\n### TODO:\r\n- [x] separate `numpy` and `jax` backend.\r\n- [x] revise DICE
