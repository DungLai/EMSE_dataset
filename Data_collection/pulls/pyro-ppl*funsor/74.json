Once this is merged, we can implement the corresponding operations for the `numpy` backend. The Op class now inherits from `Dispatcher`.\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n - The default dispatcher for object types currently defaults to numpy for dispatching. I believe that we can save a small amount of time if we were to dispatch directly via `obj.sqrt()` instead of `np.sqrt(obj)`. Is this worth doing, i.e. separating out the dispatchers for Number and object type?\r\n - In `torch.py` file, for binary operators with distinct types, I had to keep the other type as `object` (consistent with our earlier implementation). Am I correct in understanding that for all operations - we expect raw (i.e. non Funsor wrapped) types except for `funsor.Number` where we can either get a wrapper `Number` or a python numeric type? My guess is yes based on the tests, but just wondering if this is a conscious decision.","created_at":"2019-03-12T22:32:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T01:46:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-13T01:46:01Z","merged_at":"2019-03-13T01:46:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"9dbb231cf2c21810039c36ee352a837bcdc0a739","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
