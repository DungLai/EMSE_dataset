Should unblock #427.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `to_funsor` conversion of `IndependentDistribution`s to directly modify parameter inputs and outputs via `funsor.Lambda` rather than representing them with `funsor.terms.Independent`, which was breaking some pattern matching in #427.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Exercised by existing tests in `test_distribution_generic.py` that use `Independent`, and more directly in #427 \r\n- Merged into #427 locally and confirmed that tests in #427
