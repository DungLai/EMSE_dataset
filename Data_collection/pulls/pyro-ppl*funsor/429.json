Interpretations can be used directly as context managers and decorators. Most interpretation classes and objects have been moved to the new file `funsor.interpretations`; of the remaining interpretations, @fritzo would like to move the remaining `Memoize` and `MonteCarlo` into this file in a future PR, but others may stay where they are (`Substitute`, `AdjointTape`, `Optimize`).\r\n\r\n## Proposed interface changes\r\n\r\n| Old | New |\r\n| ---: | :--- |\r\n| `with
