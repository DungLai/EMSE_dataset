Refactor alpha conversion logic to allow a fix to `Independent` in #226 .\r\nBefore this PR, `alpha_substitute()` was a single function with ad hoc logic to hopefully cover most cases. This PR refactors to a method `._alpha_subs()`, splitting the old if-else handling into method overloads, and adds new method overloads for a few Funsors.\r\n\r\n2. Ensure `to_funsor()` is called outside of `substitute()`.\r\nBefore this PR, alpha_convert would sometimes call `substitute()` with non-funsor values, necessitating `to_funsor()` conversions in various `eager_subs()` methods. This PR removes those old `to_funsor()` calls and adds new `to_funsor()` calls in the `._alpha_subs()` methods of each `Funsor` subclass with bound variables. This appears to be the narrowest place where relevant type information is available, since types of bound variables are not available in the `.inputs` dict.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing tests\r\n- added an assertion to `substitute()` checking that all inputs are funsors.","created_at":"2019-09-06T03:24:23Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T23:47:05Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T17:52:20Z","merged_at":"2019-09-06T17:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"d389018d0388ae221068ea311b65267f1379e774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
