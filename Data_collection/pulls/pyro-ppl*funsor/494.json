The goal is to address issues in computing expectations in `TraceEnum_ELBO` and `TraceMarkovEnum_ELBO` (#493). As of now it seems to fix `nan` gradients under `eager` interpretation in `TraceEnum_ELBO`.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm implements equivalents of `linearize()`, `transpose()` functions, and is tape-free (#446). \r\n\r\n1. **Linearize.** Variables that need to be linearized are replaced by primal- tangent tuple `JVP(primal, tangent)` and then pattern matched to propagate tangents, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nJVP(x, dx) + JVP(y, dy) = JVP(x+y, dx+dy)\r\nJVP(x, dx) * JVP(y, dy) = JVP(x*y, ydx + xdy)\r\nJVP(x, dx) * y = JVP(x*y, ydx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOut tangent is a linear function of in tangents. `JVP` is used for `(add,mul)` semiring and `LJVP` is used for `(logaddexp,add)` semiring.\r\n\r\n2. **Transpose of a linear function.** Transpose is implemented simply by inverting the order of function execution and transposing matrices, in this case swapping more primitive operations `.reduce(sum_op, \"i\")` and `.expand(\"i\")` (broadcasting does this automatically).","created_at":"2021-03-17T03:23:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T14:07:04Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d9982c99118f64ab2bb829c15f27f0d7813a6bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847976,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3OTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/WIP","name":"WIP","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/issues/494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/statuses/3fd3cbde4ec1482dd279bc0055d0ca0dd01f81e2","head":{"label":"ordabayevy:jvp","ref":"jvp","sha":"3fd3cbde4ec1482dd279bc0055d0ca0dd01f81e2","user":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":309001149,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkwMDExNDk=","name":"funsor","full_name":"ordabayevy/funsor","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ordabayevy","id":50752571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50752571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy","html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ordabayevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ordabayevy/funsor","description":"Functional
