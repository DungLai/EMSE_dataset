Here there is one generic test for each distribution method, and all that is needed to test a new distribution is to add a recipe for constructing a random instance to a list of test cases.  This change is necessary if we want to approach full coverage of the dozens of distributions in PyTorch, Pyro/NumPyro and TFP without thousands of lines of manually duplicated testing logic.\r\n\r\nI have also had to add a number of small fixes to get the new tests to pass, which I would argue is a sign of the value of these tests - even the first version here is exercising many small distribution API edge cases that would be hard to catch with the current approach.  There are also a couple of new testing utilities (`ops.isnan` and `testing.random_scale_tril`).\r\n\r\nIf the approach in this PR works, I will delete many of the one-off tests in `test_distribution.py` in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nRemaining tasks:\r\n- [x] Get generic gradient test running\r\n- [x] Add enough test cases to reach coverage parity with the tests in `test_distribution.py`\r\n- [x] Get all deterministic tests to pass and avoid nans\r\n\r\nTriaged\r\n- ~~Get all Monte Carlo tests to pass~~ - I am skeptical of the viability and usefulness of doing this and have simply disabled and removed these tests for now.","created_at":"2020-10-30T17:27:22Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T17:58:40Z","closed_at":"2020-11-11T17:58:39Z","merged_at":"2020-11-11T17:58:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"54e28ab13f0148e19a39b9446e095b86d03eb9f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
