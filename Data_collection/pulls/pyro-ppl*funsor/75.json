This method returns a funsor of the same shape as the original funsor, indeed an unbiased estimator of the original funsor, in value and all derivatives. Samples are encoded as `Delta` distributions, and differentiability is achieved by either reparametrization (for `Gaussian`) or multiplying by Dice factors (for discrete samples of `Tensor`). Sampling from a `Delta` is a no-op. Multiple samples can be drawn by passing in a `sample_inputs`, analogous to the `sample_shape` of torch.distributions.\r\n\r\nNote that `Distribution` objects do not implement `.sample()` because the only way we could draw samples would be with materialized tensors, and all current `Distribution` objects eagerly convert to other funsors (`Categorical` -> `Tensor`, `Normal` -> `Gaussian`, ...), and it is those other funsors that implement `.sample()` methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR also deletes the unused `ops.sample` and `ops.marginal` because we seem to be implementing that functionality elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- [x] I would have preferred the multiple sample result to be wrapped in a lazy `Reduce()` so as to maintain the property of unbiased estimation, however our current eager `Reduce()` semantics would unbind the resulting funsor and convert to a deeply nested `Binary()`. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- [x] Implement `Tensor.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Gaussian.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Delta.sample()`\r\n- [x] Implement `Joint.sample()`\r\n- [x] test
