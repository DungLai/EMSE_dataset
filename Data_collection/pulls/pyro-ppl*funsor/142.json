This also refactors the `torch_tensordot()` function to use `Einsum`.\r\n\r\nNote I've added einsum string validation to the `Einsum` class, so that we can detect errors before patterns are matched; previously errors would only be detected at function evaluation time.\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- refactoring is exercised by existing
