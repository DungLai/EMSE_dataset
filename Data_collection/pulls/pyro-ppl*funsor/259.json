In particular, it adds general adjoint methods for `Subs` of `Tensor` and for `Cat`, completing support for the operations appearing in `sequential_sum_product` and unblocking the adjoint experiments.  The adjoint for `Subs` of `Tensor` is implemented in such a way that generalizing it to integer variable substitution in `Gaussian`s should be very straightforward, and I'll do that in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nI've also simplified `adjoint` slightly by removing the multiplicities that were being tracked previously and removing the one suspect test that required their presence.\r\n\r\nRemaining tasks:\r\n- [x] In theory `adjoint` should work for eager `MarkovProduct` evaluation as well, but even though it simply calls `sequential_sum_product` internally, the test cases that call `MarkovProduct` are failing.  I'm not sure what's happening there, but would like to include a fix in this PR. (Update: fixed)\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Added test comparing serial and parallel sequential sum product
