`Substitution`: rename `.__call__()` to `._eager_subs()` method\r\n- [x] `Unary`: rename `.unary()` to `._eager_unary()` method\r\n- [x] `Binary`: rename `.binary()` to `_eager_binary()` function\r\n- [x] move unit laws from `Eager` to `Simplify` handler.\r\n- [x] `Reduction`: rename `.reduce()` to `._eager_reduce()` method\r\n- [ ] update tests to use appropriate
