#177 \r\n\r\nThis implements a Switching Linear Dynamical System `FunsorDistribution` using the `moment_matching` interpretation and parallel scan algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- fixes `.expand()` method of other `FunsorDistribution`s\r\n- adds a check to `GaussianHMM` that `obs_dim >= hidden_dim // 2`\r\n- reorders reduction order in `GaussianHMM` to be more numerically stable\r\n\r\n## Tested\r\n- [x] test `SwitchingLinearHMM` shapes\r\n- [x] test `SwitchingLinearHMM.log_prob()` against `GaussianHMM`\r\n- [x] unit test for `.expand()`
