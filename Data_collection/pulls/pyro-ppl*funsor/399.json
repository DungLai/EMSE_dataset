This should be analogous to `sarkka_bilmes_product` (?) with a benefit of having an interface compatible with `sequential_sum_product`. Potentially might be useful to generalize #398 to higher order markov models.\r\n\r\n**Interface**\r\n\r\n- Backward compatible with `sequential_sum_product` interface\r\n- Accepts `time` as str or Variable\r\n- Accepts `step` as dict or frozenset({time-ordered sequence of names for a markov site})\r\n- Variable names in `step` can be arbitrary\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n- [x]
