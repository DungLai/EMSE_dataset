Motivated by @ordabayevy's [forum post](https://forum.pyro.ai/t/how-to-make-custom-distributions-funsor-compatible/2351/2) about generating Funsor wrappers for custom distributions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, generic `TorchDistribution`-to-`funsor.distribution.Distribution` conversion is handled by a single pattern:\r\n```py\r\n@to_funsor.register(pyro.distributions.Distribution)\r\ndef backenddist_to_funsor(backend_dist, output=None, dim_to_name=None):\r\n    funsor_dist_class = ...\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nThis design requires the pattern to somehow identify a Funsor counterpart `funsor_dist_class` to `backend_dist`, which it currently does somewhat hackily by looking in the global namespace.  This PR tweaks this logic so that no lookup is necessary:\r\n```py\r\ndef backenddist_to_funsor(funsor_dist_class, backend_dist, ...):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nto_funsor.register(MyDistribution)(functools.partial(backenddist_to_funsor, funsor_dist_class))\r\n```\r\nBy including the final line above in the distribution wrapper generator `funsor.distribution.make_dist`, users should in many cases no longer need to implement `to_funsor` for custom distributions.\r\n\r\nI have also deleted a superfluous conversion pattern `funsor.distribution.mvndist_to_funsor` whose functionality is duplicated in an `eager` pattern.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Refactor exercised by existing
