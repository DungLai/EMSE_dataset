The design choices in this version were made with a view toward locality of changes - the overall distribution API is left unchanged, as is the behavior of `normalize` and `eager`, and I've reused `funsor.delta.solve` even though it should probably be broken up into separate inversion and linearization transformations.\r\n\r\nThe number of transforms currently supported is very limited, partly because we don't have many transforms wrapped as `TransformOp`s in Funsor and partly because `solve` cannot handle inverting more complex expressions.  I've at least tried to get the two most important higher-order transforms `ComposeTransform` and `InverseTransform` working, so that adding more transforms later will be relatively straightforward.  For ease of review, I have also chosen to leave support for the JAX backend to a followup PR, though it should simply involve copying the additions to `funsor.torch.distributions` verbatim.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Added several `TransformedDistribution` test cases using the infrastructure from #389 \r\n\r\nTasks remaining:\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for density\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for cons-hashing\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for sampling\r\n- [x] Add unit tests for transform conversion\r\n- [x] Get generic conversion tests to pass\r\n\r\nOut of scope for this PR:\r\n- Support more transforms\r\n- Add similar capability to the JAX backend\r\n- Add more distribution conversion unit tests, especially interactions with `Independent` - added one `Independent` case, but conversion failing\r\n- Add better documentation for working with transformed distributions and `Lebesgue` - moving `Lebesgue` to another
