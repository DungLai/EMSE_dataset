#71 and will replace #54 's [Expectation](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/blob/4e75094d56/funsor/expectation.py) class.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `Contract(lhs, rhs, reduced_vars)` term for representing expectations of complicated functions wrt joint measures like guide programs.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Fix product measure tests against einsum\r\n- [x] Turn current `Integrate` into `Contract`\r\n- [x] Add `reduced_vars` argument for partial integration\r\n- [x] Split `funsor.contract` module renaming changes into separate PR to simplify the diff\r\n- [x] Rename `Contract` args to `lhs`, `rhs`\r\n- [x] Fix general tests against einsum\r\n- [x] implement `eager.register(Contract, Tensor, Tensor, frozenset)` using einsum (probably using [interleaved input](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_format.html#interleaved-input))\r\n- [x] Implement `eager_subs`\r\n\r\nTriaged (will handle in followup PRs so we can get this merged):\r\n- Make new `Integrate` that assumes the `measure` is in log-space and `integrand` is in linear space\r\n- Handle `Joint` either in `optimize(Integrate)` or by decomposing into a `Finitary(ops.add, ...)`\r\n- Use cost to decide contraction order\r\n- Look into making iterated expectation less conservative by exploiting directionality\r\n- Make repeated connected components analysis in `contract_finitary_ground` cheaper\r\n- Parametrize `Contract` with a sum and product operation\r\n- Add adjoint op for `Contract`","created_at":"2019-03-15T22:15:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T19:31:05Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T19:22:45Z","merged_at":"2019-03-20T19:22:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cca0f8c7f107d46b8d2c8a9645a5fb4213fa3fc","assignee":{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"eb8680","id":2032320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzIzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2032320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680","html_url":"https://github.com/eb8680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eb8680/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1243847501,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQzODQ3NTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/funsor/labels/awaiting%20review","name":"awaiting
