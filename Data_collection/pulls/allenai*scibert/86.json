This means one could only use it for inference. To address this problem in the future I would suggest creating [entry_points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation) for the `scripts`. One could use [data_files](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files)  for the `data` folder.\r\n- I wanted to use the official `allennlp` branch since https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3537 introduced the gradient accumulation feature. However, the merged commit is only available in the new major releases (`1.x.x`) and it breaks the `scibert` code. Therefore I gave up and use the fork https://github.com/ibeltagy/allennlp@fp16_and_others instead (as done currently in `requirements.txt`)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-15T08:22:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T12:02:32Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T11:58:08Z","merged_at":"2020-05-15T11:58:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae9f98f58a9793781148ccf715b03f7160060f24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/pulls/86/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/pulls/86/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/issues/86/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scibert/statuses/a67e7f52a8c65fa612133d8be3bf82f8b29526b8","head":{"label":"jankrepl:make_installable","ref":"make_installable","sha":"a67e7f52a8c65fa612133d8be3bf82f8b29526b8","user":{"login":"jankrepl","id":18519371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl","html_url":"https://github.com/jankrepl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jankrepl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"allenai:master","ref":"master","sha":"7598219a8d80b9c2fe1323a141e4a9e40ec044cb","user":{"login":"allenai","id":5667695,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Njc2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5667695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168397780,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgzOTc3ODA=","name":"scibert","full_name":"allenai/scibert","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allenai","id":5667695,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU2Njc2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5667695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenai/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scibert","description":"A
