Right now, all I added was\r\n```\r\n# automl/tests/test_base.py\r\nself.assertTrue(hasattr(tag, \"pred_col_suffix\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's because the way `TestAdaptorGood` inherits from `DFMLAdaptor` and then overwrites `predict` makes adding a test there awkward. Should we instead have one on both `TPOTAdaptor` and `SinglePipelineAdaptor`?\r\n\r\nAlso, let me know if you'd like a different name for `pred_col_suffix`.","created_at":"2019-11-18T19:04:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-03T02:10:20Z","closed_at":"2020-05-03T02:10:20Z","merged_at":"2020-05-03T02:10:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7b0251e22a6213eb61b5b0e9e8646d47f17c349","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/pulls/267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/pulls/267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/issues/267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hackingmaterials/automatminer/statuses/2c7956d57ef1acf2c00ed7f76886d4ec641337c3","head":{"label":"janosh:master","ref":"master","sha":"2c7956d57ef1acf2c00ed7f76886d4ec641337c3","user":{"login":"janosh","id":30958850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30958850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh","html_url":"https://github.com/janosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"hackingmaterials:master","ref":"master","sha":"53cd13e1029640567da99d251e145748ab4b1fec","user":{"login":"hackingmaterials","id":14116185,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0MTE2MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14116185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132939275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI5MzkyNzU=","name":"automatminer","full_name":"hackingmaterials/automatminer","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hackingmaterials","id":14116185,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0MTE2MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14116185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials","html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackingmaterials/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer","description":"An
