updated base classes for all dataframe transformers and extended it to allow for modular automl adaptors\r\n- added fit and transform methods to featurization and tpot\r\n- major refactors of basically everything except metafeatures\r\n- rewriting of tpot class to allow for transferability\r\n- rewriting of featurization class to allow for transferability\r\n- rewrote tests for featurization\r\n- updated tests for datacleaner and featurereducer\r\n- major bug fixes in datacleaner and featurereducer to allow for transferability\r\n- renamed top level class and briefly outlined how it will work, now that things are more defined\r\n- added logging to each
