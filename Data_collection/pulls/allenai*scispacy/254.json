One of the bionlp entities has a hyphen, so i added to the data loading replacing the hyphen with an underscore. I don't believe this impacts the model at all, just the printing of the entity names.\r\n\r\nand then one additional point. When I trained the models last time, I did intend for the parser, tagger and proper vocab from the md model to be included in the specialized NER models, but I did not actually intend for the NER pipe to start training from the md NER pipe. It is not obvious to me whether this should help or hurt, but something to consider for next time. If we wanted to start the NER pipe from scratch, we would just change here https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/c286a325c7678c8d58744563c763d93e86251494/scripts/train_specialised_ner.py#L76 to create a new pipe and remove the existing NER pipe.","created_at":"2020-07-21T22:01:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T23:22:07Z","closed_at":"2020-07-21T23:22:02Z","merged_at":"2020-07-21T23:22:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9f0daeae9a76c644166f852f1d8a101e77d9593","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/pulls/254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/pulls/254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/statuses/417fc3d889c324b979bf69578d29167fdb4ec615","head":{"label":"dakinggg:bionlp_entity_names","ref":"bionlp_entity_names","sha":"417fc3d889c324b979bf69578d29167fdb4ec615","user":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":150174886,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTAxNzQ4ODY=","name":"scispacy","full_name":"dakinggg/scispacy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg/scispacy","description":"This
