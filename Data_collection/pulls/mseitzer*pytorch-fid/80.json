So I went and implemented it! The user can simply specify the `--save-stats` flag and the stats of the first path will be generated and saved in the location of the second path.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* Add the argument `--save-stats` to the argument parser\r\n* Implement `save_fid_stats` using `calcualte_fid_given_paths` as a guide and making use of `np.savez_compressed`\r\n* In `__main__`, if the `--save-stats` flag has been specified, run `save_fid_stats` and exit early. This design makes it clear that the `--save-stats` flag is the option and the original workflow is still the primary workflow.\r\n* Update `README.md` to document the changes\r\n    *  My editor strips trailing whitespace. I believe that this is best practice so I have kept these changes in this PR. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have manually tested the new workflow and the original and they behave exactly as expected. By logical inspection of the changes I've made, I believe no errors will have been introduced, however, I failed to run the included test suite due to an error that is present on master - prior to my changes. The error I am receiving is:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: compute_statistics_of_path() got an unexpected keyword argument 'num_workers'\r\n```\r\nPlease advise how to fix this and I can rerun the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Code formatting\r\nI have done my best to copy the style in which the existing code is written. I could not find a linter that is in use - if there is one, please make me aware of it.","created_at":"2021-12-03T22:41:59Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T22:33:49Z","closed_at":"2023-01-05T12:58:44Z","merged_at":"2023-01-05T12:58:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"68898254aee98f7f0ff520544f7cb668b83ad2d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/pulls/80/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/pulls/80/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/80/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/statuses/db8790ab38990d317494e2359591417fdac16f35","head":{"label":"jwblangley:save-stats","ref":"save-stats","sha":"db8790ab38990d317494e2359591417fdac16f35","user":{"login":"jwblangley","id":14108795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTA4Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14108795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley","html_url":"https://github.com/jwblangley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434740728,"node_id":"R_kgDOGemd-A","name":"pytorch-fid","full_name":"jwblangley/pytorch-fid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwblangley","id":14108795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTA4Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14108795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley","html_url":"https://github.com/jwblangley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwblangley/pytorch-fid","description":"Compute
