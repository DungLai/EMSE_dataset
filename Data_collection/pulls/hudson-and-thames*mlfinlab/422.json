Optimal Transport is well described in the blog post by Dr. Gautier Marti [available here](https://gmarti.gitlab.io/qfin/2020/06/25/copula-optimal-transport-dependence.html) and the [following research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09659.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe supported target copulas are:\r\n-  A comonotone copula.\r\n-  A countermonotone copula.\r\n- A Gaussian copula with a custom correlation coefficient.\r\n- A copula of both positive and negative correlation.\r\n- A copula with some elements having extreme variations, while those of others are relatively small, and conversely.\r\n- A copula with elements being positively correlated for small variations but uncorrelated otherwise.\r\n\r\nBoth MI estimators and OT distance can be used both in the individual functions - `get_mutual_info` and `optimal_transport_distance` and in the general `get_dependence_matrix` function.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #428: a small bug in the HERC documentation.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been
