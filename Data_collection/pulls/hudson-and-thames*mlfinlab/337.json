Description\r\n**Codependence by Marti:**\r\n\r\nThis is the implementation of Spearman's Rho, the GPR, and the GNPF codependency metrics described in the work of Gautier Marti \"Some contributions to the clustering of financial time series and applications to credit default swaps\".\r\n\r\nThe code is built in the form of separate functions.\r\n\r\nThe unit test and Sphinx documentation are also provided with the code.\r\n\r\n**Codependence toctree:**\r\nThis PR also creates a separate toctree for Codependence metrics, updates the documentation, docstrings, and some of the functions in that module.\r\n\r\n**Bug fixes:**\r\nCurrently this PR fixes: #355, #262, #362 \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests of the Codependence module were updated with tests for the new functions.\r\n\r\n- [x] test_codependence.py\r\n\r\n**Test Configuration**:\r\n* Windows 10\r\n* PyCharm\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [x] I have performed a
