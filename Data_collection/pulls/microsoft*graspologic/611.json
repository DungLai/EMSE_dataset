There are currently two dimensionality reduction processes we use; t-SNE and UMAP.  The process for each is:\r\n\r\n- take a networkx graph\r\n- shrink it if necessary by cutting the smallest edges\r\n- use only the largest connected component\r\n- create a node2vec embedding from it\r\n- use tsne or umap to get an x and y coordinate from it\r\n- automatically size each node based on their degree\r\n- run a no-overlap process that @bryantower created which shuffles things around to make sure we don't have thousands of nodes on the same point\r\n- create a color palette based on the leiden communities and a [thematic](https://microsoft.github.io/thematic) color palette and use it for the nodes in those communities\r\n- ultimately using networkx' draw graph capabilities, save the graph \r\n\r\nWe also added a runnable module so that you can call it via `python -m graspologic.layouts {args}` to run it from CLI instead of within the interpreter.  It's fairly on rails on purpose, because we wanted people to use the library not the CLI.
