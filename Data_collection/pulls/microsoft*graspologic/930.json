The \"before computation\" can be found in the link for #928 , which is inaccurate. The \"after computation\" is correct; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport graspologic as gp\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nn = 10\r\nA = gp.simulations.er_np(n, 0.5, directed=False, loops=False)\r\n# fit it

ignored)\r\n# we should get the same answer for the next two...\r\n# the first one assumes that loops result in an overcount by a factor of n^2/(2*binom(n, 2)) based on how\r\n# graspologic's sbm handles directed networks (ignores)\r\nprint(\"Estimate (adjusted with assumption of loops being mishandled): {:.4f}\".format(fit_mod.p_ * (n**2/(n*(n-1)))))\r\n\r\ninds = np.triu_indices(n,
