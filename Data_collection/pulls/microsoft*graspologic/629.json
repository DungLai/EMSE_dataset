We still technically call `setuptools.setup()`, but it knows to rely on pyproject.toml and setup.cfg to provide all the parameters, but also to use a commandline argument for any possible version appendix to use.\r\n\r\nHowever, this information is written to the sdist package, so the prerelease version numbers are maintained on publish. This is what we want.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason we are trying to get the version from source code, not the sdist package, we still try to use the `setup.cfg` file, and we append a dev tag based on today's date and time. This is most common for the developers who work on graspologic itself.\r\n\r\nThe thing this fixes is that using `pip install -r requirements.txt` no longer changes the source tree and include a then-materialized version number. This should avoid many of the accidental commits of `version.txt` that plagued and confused everyone in the past.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: We may need to do some minor tweaks to fix the build workflow stuff because some of it isn't testable until we're on dev or main.\r\n\r\nCloses
