Explain your changes.\r\nImplements plotting matrix after sorting the matrix by some metadata:\r\n- group a matrix by one or more categorical labels\r\n- sort the groups by the size of the group or the mean of some other metadata of each group\r\n- sort items within a group by some metadata\r\n- allow multiple tick and color axis to categorize the data\r\n- provides tutorial and test\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nHere is a notebook to prove the effectiveness of the implementation: [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zeou1/graspy/blob/matrix-plotting/docs/tutorials/plotting/matrixplot.ipynb)\r\n\r\nThis implementation currently stands separately from the existing plot.py file, as I did not want to make accidental changes. If needed, I can merge my implementation into plot.py. The test for plot_matrix is also separated right now.","created_at":"2020-10-19T04:45:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T19:12:07Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T19:12:07Z","merged_at":"2021-02-25T19:12:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c9b301aa5fd2275e596ddc130ffd6ce39db0a6a","assignee":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"tliu68","id":54865879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68","html_url":"https://github.com/tliu68","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2256387913,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjU2Mzg3OTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/labels/ndd","name":"ndd","color":"dda966","default":false,"description":"tasks
