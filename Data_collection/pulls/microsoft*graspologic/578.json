Rust is going to require a very strong type guarantee, which is why we wanted these more pythonic wrappers available so we can pass in multivariate types and ... gently massage them into shape.\r\n\r\nThe question is what all should we accept in the form of a `graph` item?  Should I also support np.ndarray?  sparse matrices?  Is there a distinct type of sparse matrix that every subtype supports, or do I need to type hint to support scipy.sparse.csr.csr_matrix and scipy.sparse.coo.coo_matrix (or whatever they are)?  Do we have any idea what this should look like?\r\n\r\nSecondly, the docs for native are going to always be more accurate re: behaviors since they exist in rustdocs in the algorithms itself, but the types will be different.  I'm not wanting to necessarily repeat myself, but I do want to say something about how we support different types.  I can do some grody python to gather the documentation for graspologic_native and find/replace some of the parameter types to be more in line with the pythonic wrappers, or I could replicate it, but I don't like any solution.  What do you guys think?
