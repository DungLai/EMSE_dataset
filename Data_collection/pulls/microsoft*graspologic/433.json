An optional parameter `concat` (default False) is added to  `baseEmbed.__init__`,  as well as the `__init__`  methods of it's children. When `baseEmbed.fit_transform_` is called and  concat is true,  returns the left and right latent matrices concatenated on axis 1. If `concat` is False it behaves the same as before, and returns a tuple of the left and right latent matrices. \r\n\r\nAlso add tests of directed embedding to `test_spectral_embed.py` and `test_omni.py`, and refactors `test_mase` to make use of new concat parameter.
