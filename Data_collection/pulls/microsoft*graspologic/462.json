Explain your changes.\r\nAdded n_features_in_ to three embedded class estimators, ase.py, lse.py, and mds.py\r\nFor ase and lse, the n_features_in_ attribute equals to the number of points in the graph. And for mds, the attribute equals to the number of features of the first dimension of each sample.\r\n\r\nCompared to PR #434, this pull request changes the definition of n_features_in_ for mds from the total number of features to the number of features in the first dimension.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nThis pull request is made after the merge with Microsoft.
