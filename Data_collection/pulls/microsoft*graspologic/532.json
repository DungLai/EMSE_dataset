Explain your changes.\r\n- Add `mypi.ini` since the 3rd party packages dont have type checks. This stops errors due to imports.\r\n- Two error fixes in mypy\r\n\r\nThe above will pass mypy check.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- @dwaynepryce - the command for mypy check needs to add `--config-file ./mypi.ini`.\r\n- I think the mypy check right now is kind of useless without some sort of coverage. Maybe something like `--disallow-untyped-defs` ([description](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-disallow-untyped-defs)) arg to be included. This will fail the check unless all functions have type hints.
