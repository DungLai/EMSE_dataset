It includes a few QOL items like an int-ifying graph builder class that will generate an `nx.Graph` or `nx.DiGraph`, a preconditions module for type checking (probably could end up in a utils module in the top level), an Embeddings return object that makes it trivial to correlate a node id to it's respective tensor, and an implementation of ASE-as-a-function.\r\n\r\nOf particular note is that it does not use the built-in elbow finder yet, instead behaving more similarly to the topologic approach of using a combination of fixed dimensionality requested and the elbow finder on that.  We've discussed addressing our `graspologic.embed.AdjacencySpectralEmbed` elbow-finding concerns in a meeting and we're reasonably confident we can have a consistent behavior in both in the future, but for now this works well enough.","created_at":"2021-07-29T21:21:22Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T15:27:35Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T15:27:35Z","merged_at":"2021-08-03T15:27:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e671431d81b312c7baff4d8d1c1949ad21e0364","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jonmclean","id":4429525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"Nyecarr","id":4693255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTMyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4693255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr","html_url":"https://github.com/Nyecarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/af18c2d6e5de389ea62e9fca7dbc8678aa02bf80","head":{"label":"microsoft:pipeline-ase","ref":"pipeline-ase","sha":"af18c2d6e5de389ea62e9fca7dbc8678aa02bf80","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github
