Explain your changes.\r\n\r\nThis update fixes a variety of build warnings that arose when netlify attempts to build the documentation.  Specifically, variables 'p_value_1_' and 'p_value_2_' were enclosed in back ticks (\\`\\`) some lines were indented, some blank lines were inserted, a duplicate argument, \"spherical\", was replaced by the missing argument option, \"full\".  In addition, all of the release announcement were included in a toctree, and the html_static_path was set to the empty list because there was no directory named \"_static\" (the default).  \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-07T00:21:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-20T18:14:25Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T19:35:30Z","merged_at":"2020-09-18T19:35:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5359c1dff7e3eb70cd7b376513c90e50b23bb25b","assignee":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2256387913,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjU2Mzg3OTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/labels/ndd","name":"ndd","color":"dda966","default":false,"description":"tasks
