Issues/PRs\r\nCloses #984\r\n\r\n#### What does this do \r\nImplements a new embedding model based on node features/categories \r\n\r\n#### TODOs\r\n- [ ] Should directed graphs yield separate in/out embeddings?\r\n   - Not mentioned in the actual paper or code as far as I can tell, but I think they are just summing what could be thought of as source/target embeddings\r\n- [ ] Should actually discrete features have a separate implementation?\r\n   - Basically, can make this work with indexing instead of adding the entire vector to the embedding\r\n   - However, implementation right now is super super simple, which I like :) \r\n- [ ] Improve documentation, build and make sure it looks good\r\n- [ ] Add tutorial\r\n   - I have notebook with replication of their simulations\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-15T18:24:29Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T17:32:49Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b3108641ccc104e6166fe2679b0be0773fcb6b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/182f34d82f9bcdb9388df1b3ce6cb9c8f1dc097e","head":{"label":"microsoft:gee","ref":"gee","sha":"182f34d82f9bcdb9388df1b3ce6cb9c8f1dc097e","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147768493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3Njg0OTM=","name":"graspologic","full_name":"microsoft/graspologic","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic","description":"Python
