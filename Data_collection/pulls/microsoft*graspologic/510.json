Please ensure you have taken a look at\r\nthe contribution guidelines: https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-checklist\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #316, supersedes #472.\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR brings padded SGM to graspologic, allowing users to pass in input matrices of different sizes to `GraphMatch`. This is an implementation of the padding scheme describing in [Seeded Graph Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.0367.pdf) (section 2.5). Both schemes described (adopted and naive), are implemented here, allowing users the option to choose which they'd prefer to use.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes some redundant tests in the match submodule.\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nProof of effectiveness can be found in the following [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asaadeldin11/nbview/blob/master/padded_sgm.ipynb), where Figure 3 from SGM is replicated.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-02T15:02:57Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T16:49:44Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T16:22:54Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T16:22:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae659d8a5c7a93ea308b5348c0c8f64716aca66e","assignee":{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/3fa29fece119781734f93ba6d1ca13b85a996ada","head":{"label":"microsoft:padded-sgm","ref":"padded-sgm","sha":"3fa29fece119781734f93ba6d1ca13b85a996ada","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147768493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3Njg0OTM=","name":"graspologic","full_name":"microsoft/graspologic","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic","description":"Python
