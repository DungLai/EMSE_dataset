For each strain, connectomes were generated from eight age-matched mice (N = 8 per strain), with a sex distribution of four males and four females. Each connectome was parcellated using asymmetric Waxholm Space, yielding a vertex set with a total of 332 regions of interest (ROIs) symmetrically distributed across the left and right hemispheres. Within a given hemisphere, there are seven superstructures consisting up multiple ROIs, resulting in a total of 14 distinct communities in each connectome.","created_at":"2020-11-27T07:48:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T04:22:43Z","closed_at":"2021-01-06T04:22:42Z","merged_at":"2021-01-06T04:22:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b485942fce747da20d62a0dbfff8683d6abd7bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2374279539,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzc0Mjc5NTM5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/labels/needs_reviewers","name":"needs_reviewers","color":"f4a6d8","default":false,"description":"Help
