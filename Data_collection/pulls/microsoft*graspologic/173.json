Explain your changes.\r\nAdds classes for fitting unweighted graph models to data, including ER, DCER, SBM, DCSBM, and RDPG\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- Does not support weights\r\n- There are many ways to estimate communities in the a posteriori SBM and DCSBM. Here, only one is implemented, but we could support more or find which methods are best in the future \r\n- There are several different ways to model the relationship between degree corrections and community membership in the DCSBM. For now, the degree correction parameters are tied to a simple block, but another model would be to randomly sample a community membership and independently sample a degree correction parameter
