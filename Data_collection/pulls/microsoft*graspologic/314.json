in which the probability of an edge existing between pairs of vertices is determined by the dot product of the associated latent position vectors. \r\n\r\nThe principle is that given a matrix X, the probability matrix will be calculated as P = XX^T, and then the correlated graph pairs will be generate based on the P and correlation. \r\n\r\nHere is the link to the paper:
