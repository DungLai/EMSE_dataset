This is more intuitive for when the graphs are of different sizes, regardless of the order in which they are input.\r\n\r\n#### Design decisions\r\n- I opted to use a function rather than a class for the user-facing graph matching tools. This is because graph matching is not exactly a \"model,\" or in other words I think people would be very unlikely to ever \"fit\" a permutation to one pair of graphs and then \"predict\" using the estimated permutation on another. \r\n- I tried to make the interface somewhat like https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html in the sense that I am now outputing *two* sets of indices, but here the first one corresponds to the input matrix `A` and the second to the input matrix `B`. For cases where the two matrices are the same, then the first set of indices is basically worthless: it will always be just the sorted indices of `A`, or in otherwords `np.arange(n)`. This is much like what happens with `linear_sum_assignment` in scipy. However, for differently sized matrices (in particular when `A` is bigger than `B`), then not everyone in `A` will get a match, so this matters. See https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/discussions/925 for some discussion (it was confusing what happens with differently sized matrices).\r\n- I added some better logging/timing features because I often want to know what aspects of the algorithm are taking a long time when I'm matching large matrices.\r\n- I opted to add the `transport` functionality simply as extra parameters - this is mainly because all of the other parameters would be the same, and I felt it would be annoying to have a completely separate function to do this small adjustment to the matching algorithm.\r\n   - The downside is that this adds several parameters to the algorithm which wont matter when `transport=False`. Tons of parameters can be lame. But I did try to alleviate this by labeling those parameters with the `transport_` prefix.\r\n- I opted to only support the `numpy.random.Generator` syntax. This is because the `RandomState` syntax is considered legacy by numpy so I don't think any new code should bend over backwards to support it, IMO https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/legacy.html#legacy\r\n- I opted to use for loops for the multigraph cases for readability and compatibility with sparse arrays/matrices. There is a way to do similar operations with `np.einsum` but it is very hard to read and reason about, IMO.\r\n- I changed how the input initialization is specified because I did not like having a single parameter that could be a string, array, or float (which was tough to reason about internally). \r\n- Rather than shuffle the entire input matrix to begin with as we did in the past, I simply shuffle/unshuffle every time `linear_sum_assignment` is called, since this is the only place this matters. I think the computational cost of the shuffle is minimal, and this makes the rest of the code easier to reason about since we dont have as many shuffle/unshuffle operations to do.\r\n   - I almost wanted to do the same for the seed/unseed stuff, but I didn't go that far.\r\n- Decided to axe adding numba for now, just want to get in what we have here so far. Will make a new issue and revisit, potentially.\r\n\r\n#### Remaining work [Done now]\r\nThis is currently a work in progress, making the PR to document progress and what needs to be done: \r\n- [x] implement padding\r\n- [x] implement wrapper function(s)\r\n- [x] implement computation of \"score\" (objective function value)\r\n- [x] type-hints\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [x] documentation\r\n- [x] implement handling of outlier cases (such as all nodes are seeded) \r\n- [x] tutorials updated accordingly\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-24T15:21:02Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T17:59:28Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T17:59:22Z","merged_at":"2022-08-30T17:59:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"facb6a86966066460776cca3e07bf729bb964d09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/23f1fe449ba36899d25115c9b2779e162dd01ba1","head":{"label":"microsoft:new-gm","ref":"new-gm","sha":"23f1fe449ba36899d25115c9b2779e162dd01ba1","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147768493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3Njg0OTM=","name":"graspologic","full_name":"microsoft/graspologic","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic","description":"Python
