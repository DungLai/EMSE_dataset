Explain your changes.\r\n1. Anomaly detection for time series of graphs and vertices.\r\n2. Refactored code for importing multiple graphs from `BaseEmbedMulti` to `utils.py`. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- I was thinking for these functions/classes that combine bunch of stuff together, we could do something like `**embed_kwargs` instead of copying and carrying over all the embed parameters.  So things like `n_components`, `n_elbows`, `algorithm`, etc. Thoughts?\r\n- This could be in an anomaly module, but I put it in `pipeline` instead.\r\n- No tutorials here. Perhaps NDD task to recreate some figures in the paper. Happy to help.\r\n- No parallelization here. I could implement parallelization for the embedding part.
