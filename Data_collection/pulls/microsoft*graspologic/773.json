Briefly explain your changes.\r\nOriginal implementation of node2vec only truly worked if a graph's node ids were strings. Because gensim's word2vec expects strings to generate the random walks, we were getting incorrect results when passing in a graph with node ids of any type other than string. This PR will fix this issue by immediately creating a new graph that has the same exact edgelist except all node ids are remapped to a unique string. Then, before returning the embedding, we remap the results from word2vec back to the original node ids.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nN2v is used in when generating layouts so I added an additional test around layout_umap to verify both string and int node ids return as expected.","created_at":"2021-04-20T01:36:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T21:51:56Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T21:51:55Z","merged_at":"2021-04-20T21:51:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"508b5441c97633e12587ce2b05319d773aff4134","assignee":{"login":"Nyecarr","id":4693255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTMyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4693255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr","html_url":"https://github.com/Nyecarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Nyecarr","id":4693255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTMyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4693255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr","html_url":"https://github.com/Nyecarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/a0ebbd2af6a3d2cc348cb09ba55fd8a8bd374bb4","head":{"label":"microsoft:n2v-relabel-nodeids","ref":"n2v-relabel-nodeids","sha":"a0ebbd2af6a3d2cc348cb09ba55fd8a8bd374bb4","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147768493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3Njg0OTM=","name":"graspologic","full_name":"microsoft/graspologic","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic","description":"Python
