Adds all code to implement, test, and demonstrate algorithm. \r\n\r\nVNviaSGM is a nomination algorithm, so instead of completely matching two graphs `A` and `B`, it proposes a nomination list of potential matches in graph `B` to a vertex of interest (voi) in graph `A`. VNviaSGM matches subgraphs about the given seeds and orders many times. All these results are then averaged to produce a nomination probability list for the voi.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm Described in:\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00674.pdf\r\n\r\nProof it works:
