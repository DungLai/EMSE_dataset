Briefly explain your changes.\r\n- Updates typing to reflect the new scipy sparse array standard\r\n- Adds Int and Scalar types to accommodate beartype yelling at me about having ints instead of floats as well as some confusing behavior with numpy integer being considered not an integer.\r\n- Fixes an unrelated error in CASC tutorial which popped up I think from seaborn 0.12\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- I wrote the typing such that if someone has scipy < 1.8, it will fall back on the old stuff\r\n   - Note: I think #981 is going to bump scipy to 1.8 anyway, though \r\n- I don't think the array/matrix distinction makes any difference in our actual code base other than the typing.\r\n   - The two behave differently when using the `*` operator, but I don't think we do with them\r\n- I didn't go in an replace int with Int everywhere in the package since that would be a lot of diff and may not ALWAYS be desired; I did refactor in the graph matching code because I found those types useful there recently\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-15T15:38:17Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T14:46:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52b66e257fab5fe3a0266f0e4694b3883d777ab3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/1de939dbdf25277e885407f6c45a2e7ef3770d92","head":{"label":"microsoft:csr_array","ref":"csr_array","sha":"1de939dbdf25277e885407f6c45a2e7ef3770d92","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147768493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3Njg0OTM=","name":"graspologic","full_name":"microsoft/graspologic","private":false,"owner":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic","description":"Python
