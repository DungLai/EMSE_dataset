Explain your changes.\r\nThis PR brings padded SGM to graspologic, allowing users to pass in input matrices of different sizes to `GraphMatch`. This is an implementation of the padding scheme describing in [Seeded Graph Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.0367.pdf) (section 2.5). Both schemes described (adopted and naive), are implemented here, allowing users the option to choose which they'd prefer to use.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nProof of effectiveness can be found in the following [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asaadeldin11/nbview/blob/master/padded_sgm.ipynb), where Figure 3 from SGM is replicated.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-21T15:49:46Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T15:04:41Z","closed_at":"2020-10-02T15:04:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8f5673e99716f324de2da2a182c9923cba1ab7d","assignee":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1048646807,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ4NjQ2ODA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New
