Briefly explain your changes.\r\nWhen running Leiden, if your graph has `int` (or anything other than `str`) node IDs, we automatically convert them to string representations for the native leiden impl to handle.  The problem is that the node id -> partition dictionary we return uses the `str` representation as the key, which won't map up to the value you actually provided in your networkx Graph.\r\n\r\nThis definitively fixes the bug in Leiden - which was one of the issues we had in #738!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that 738 also has a bug almost the same in n2v - namely, that the nodes are converted to strings for word2vec to operate over them, then returned as string labels.  We fixed the first problem, but not the second - yet.  @nyecarr is working on a n2v refactor that will fix this, and thus fully close #738.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, this should solve Leiden over our graphs.  ~~I just realized I also need to create a test to validate it works over matrices as well as networkx - so I'll make sure that works in a test prior to actually completing this PR.~~ This is done now\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me that we need a new minor release with a breaking API change if we haven't actually published a final release of 0.2.0 yet.  Our dev / prerelease versions will certainly have a breaking api change, but ... I don't think this needs to become 0.3.0?
