Explain your changes.\r\n- Introduces align module, which has the following three classes:\r\n  - SignFlips\r\n    - Previously a function in the LatentDistributionTest.\r\n  - OrthogonalProcrustes\r\n    - Effectively a wrapper of the scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes().\r\n  - SeedlessProcrustes\r\n    - Also colloquially known as JAgt; aligns the two dataset via an iterative algorithm that alternates optimal transport and regular procrustes.\r\n    - Massively sped up from the previous implementation, predominantly by omitting the outer-most loop, and also by using the POT package.\r\n- All classes have a consistent .fit_transform() type of API, where they take two datasets in fit() and one dataset in transform.\r\n- Substitutes scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes() and LatentDistributionTest.medial_sign_flips() with objects of the module everywhere where applicable.\r\n- Added an option to use SeedlessProcrustes as alignment techniques in LatentDistributionTest (but not default yet); added necessary arguments and documentation.\r\n- Includes tests for all of the modules, as well as tests for the new / changed functionality of the tests.\r\n- Some comments / docs changed / added in LPT / LDT.\r\n- fit_plug_in_variance_estimator migrated from LatentDistributionTest to utils. Unchanged otherwise (future work will be #378).\r\n- fixed the docs of the inference module while i was at it.\r\n- Slightly refactored LDT code (see #380). .metric is now always what user is provided. The associated callable is .metric_func(). Furthermore, .test is now what user has provided as test. hyppo object get instantiated in .fit, which should be much safer for resuing. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- No tutorial notebooks made. See #414 .\r\n- Does NOT implement scaling-rotation or diagonal-rotation type of procrustes as a part of the module.","created_at":"2020-09-03T13:44:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T21:49:25Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T21:49:11Z","merged_at":"2020-10-05T21:49:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbbc68a24ca9e2097575e7f92f809916ea3eeb46","assignee":{"login":"alyakin314","id":25692376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjkyMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25692376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314","html_url":"https://github.com/alyakin314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alyakin314","id":25692376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjkyMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25692376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314","html_url":"https://github.com/alyakin314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/statuses/bba6996d246a5a9d88d1b81a1b97c554e5d16f2a","head":{"label":"microsoft:align-module-rebase-2","ref":"align-module-rebase-2","sha":"bba6996d246a5a9d88d1b81a1b97c554e5d16f2a","user":{"login":"microsoft","id":6154722,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxNTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microsoft/followers","followi
