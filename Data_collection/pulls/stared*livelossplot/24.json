Calling dict.values() in Python3 returns a 'dict_values' object (which cannot be indexed) instead of a list, so the solution is to explicitly set it as a list using `losses = list(self.model.loss.values())` in the early part of the code.","created_at":"2018-10-26T02:25:35Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T08:39:53Z","closed_at":"2018-11-02T08:39:41Z","merged_at":"2018-11-02T08:39:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7b545f88bc6a11e98f271918170675f9e013511","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/pulls/24/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/pulls/24/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/24/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/statuses/0b6d3b7e3e9382d5ba1f943febcd55b858220261","head":{"label":"weiji14:master","ref":"master","sha":"0b6d3b7e3e9382d5ba1f943febcd55b858220261","user":{"login":"weiji14","id":23487320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDg3MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23487320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14","html_url":"https://github.com/weiji14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiji14/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"stared:master","ref":"master","sha":"34fc8e9cd2c171874ce6c030a9013e9c1982fb1c","user":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124682643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQ2ODI2NDM=","name":"livelossplot","full_name":"stared/livelossplot","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stared/livelossplot","description":"Live
