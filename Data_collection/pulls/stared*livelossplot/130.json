The idea is to use positive values so that we say start from step 5, and negative (e.g -100), so that we show up to 100 last steps. For zero we don't use the option at all.\r\n\r\n#125 has an approach for `MatplotlibPlot` only. I wanted to do it differently - by creating an option for `MainLogger`, so that it will propagate to all other elements as well (e.g. `ExtremaPrinter`).\r\n\r\n* [X] add to `MainLogger`\r\n* [X] make it work with `MatplotlibPlot` (sort of works)\r\n* [x] make it work without pesky warnings :)\r\n* [x] make it work with `ExtremaPrinter` (we want, and need, to remove value caching)\r\n* [x] make it
