This led to zero filters for high downsamplings and low frequencies, because the central frequency of the wavelet was in between zero and the first DC frequency. I had not noticed this because I had only used this at low downsamplings (low `J`).\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the filter at the maximal resolution is computed from the formula, and its downsampled versions are computed by downsampling it - which is how it should be.\r\n\r\n**IFFT for U1**\r\nThe issue was clearly explained in #37 . I added the IFFT, followed by real part and unpadding at the corresponding resolution. Because all U1[lambda]x do not live at the same resolution, they cannot be stacked in the same tensor so I added an error when the option `vectorize` is `True` to be able to return a dictionary of Ux tensors\r\n\r\n**Warning for border effects**\r\nIn order to avoid border effects, the signal of support size `T` is padded on the left and on the right. The size of the padding is determined dynamically based on the temporal support of the low-pass. \r\n\r\nWhen the support `T` of the original filter is very small (`T <= 512 = 2**9`) and the scattering scale `2**J` is commensurate with `T`, then the decay of the low-pass is too slow to define a \"temporal support\": it behaves like a uniform averaging. Before, the software raised an error because it was not able to define the support of the low-pass in this case. Now, it issues a warning regarding the existence of border effects and continues.","created_at":"2018-10-25T10:03:46Z","updated_at":"2018-10-28T18:23:53Z","closed_at":"2018-10-28T16:06:22Z","merged_at":"2018-10-28T16:06:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"e19472a46a1dfe528e45f410820bcd4c8f21793b","assignee":{"login":"AndreuxMath","id":10076572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10076572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreuxMath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"AndreuxMath","id":10076572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10076572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreuxMath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rleonarduzzi","id":10959323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU5MzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10959323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi","html_url":"https://github.com/rleonarduzzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rleonarduzzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/39/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/39/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/39/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/statuses/750fd7e73f994d8081d67334c960d496e879c1f5","head":{"label":"AndreuxMath:bug_filter","ref":"bug_filter","sha":"750fd7e73f994d8081d67334c960d496e879c1f5","user":{"login":"AndreuxMath","id":10076572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10076572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreuxMath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":151387935,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTEzODc5MzU=","name":"scattering_transform","full_name":"AndreuxMath/scattering_transform","private":true,"owner":{"login":"AndreuxMath","id":10076572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10076572?v=4","gravatar_i
