The implementation is backend-agnostic.\r\n\r\nHowever, temporal and frequential averaging are not yet supported, and the formatting is \"3D\" (concatenated in frequency) for now. I will provide functions for `temporal_averaging`, `frequential_averaging`, and `split` in later PR's, to allow other formats. We will also have to run a `DryBackend` through this function in order to obtain an automatic `jtfs.meta()` (in the spirit of #893) and `jtfs.output_size()`.\r\n\r\nThanks to previous PR's #923 (merged) and #935 (under review), the core function ends up being very short: six lines of code, and a single for loop.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef joint_timefrequency_scattering(U_0, backend, filters, oversampling,\r\n         average_local, filters_fr, oversampling_fr, average_local_fr):\r\n    time_gen = time_scattering_widthfirst(U_0, backend, filters, oversampling, average_local)\r\n    yield next(time_gen)\r\n    S_1 = next(time_gen)\r\n    yield from frequency_scattering(S_1, backend,\r\n        filters_fr, average_local_fr, oversampling_fr, spinned=False)\r\n    for Y_2 in time_gen:\r\n        yield from frequency_scattering(Y_2, backend,\r\n            filters_fr, average_local_fr, oversampling_fr, spinned=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have added comments to explain the role of each line above. I have also added various tests to check metadata and array sizes. Once we have a proper frontend to call this (in the continuation of #928 and #931), it would be good to add tests which analyze the response of this JTFS operator on synthetic data.\r\n\r\nTagging
