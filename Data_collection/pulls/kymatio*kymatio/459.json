This is up next for review, then TF. \r\n\r\nI tried to make some fixes, however the tests do not run. The current error I am getting is `E       TypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'J' and 'shape'`, and this is occurring in the numpy_frontend abstract class. I'm not sure why its giving this error, when the torch frontend is initalized in the same way and there is no difference between the two. Perhaps this difference is due to the numpy abstract frontend subclassing off of object?\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-28T18:23:05Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T03:58:25Z","closed_at":"2019-12-06T03:58:25Z","merged_at":"2019-12-06T03:58:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"42b6cb28f48e57a86574a8345042f3f589b1f8d3","assignee":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"eugenium","id":3606031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDYwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3606031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium","html_url":"https://github.com/eugenium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugenium/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1076176420,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDc2MTc2NDIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New
