Hence a _big_ simplification in scope once we're able to decouple `scattering1d` from padding, averaging, and unpadding routines.","created_at":"2022-06-09T18:38:36Z","updated_at":"2022-06-25T16:24:00Z","closed_at":"2022-06-12T05:19:24Z","merged_at":"2022-06-12T05:19:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"307f468cef7e43bcd9cdee527feac2a72c3959ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/862/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/862/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/862/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/statuses/49e3e6973342bb9068f2b9a4c7b63a9e8a2dd8dd","head":{"label":"lostanlen:try-simplifying-out-type","ref":"try-simplifying-out-type","sha":"49e3e6973342bb9068f2b9a4c7b63a9e8a2dd8dd","user":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":236176364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzYxNzYzNjQ=","name":"kymatio","full_name":"lostanlen/kymatio","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen/kymatio","description":"Wavelet
