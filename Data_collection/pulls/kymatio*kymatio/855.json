But it's equivalent since`N_pad=2**J_pad`.\r\n\r\nThis first commit is a fully working example, ready for review. After it's accepted, i'll take care of cleaning up extra keyword arguments from core and call sites (TF/PT/NP frontends) and will confirm the new prototype of `scattering1d` and `compute_padding`","created_at":"2022-06-08T17:18:57Z","updated_at":"2022-06-25T16:24:43Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T16:53:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f5adbe0ecf3db03cd4bd3f4f6682d92c844e4e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/statuses/60dc346f656b4359392a6c7f79cd48794e136fef","head":{"label":"lostanlen:try-simplifying-core1d","ref":"try-simplifying-core1d","sha":"60dc346f656b4359392a6c7f79cd48794e136fef","user":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":236176364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzYxNzYzNjQ=","name":"kymatio","full_name":"lostanlen/kymatio","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen/kymatio","description":"Wavelet
