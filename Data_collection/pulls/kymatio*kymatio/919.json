This will be faster (`O(N)` instead of `O(N log N)`) and conceptually simpler than the default `T=None` (i.e., `2**J`).\r\n\r\nNote that this implementation does _not_ introduce new keyword arguments to the Scattering1D constructor. Rather, it special-cases a new string value for `T`: `'global'`. This is backwards compatible. Local averaging `T=2**J` remains and will remain the default.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, i have added a new Kymatio primitive, namely `sum`:\r\n\r\n`def sum(x, axis)`\r\nwhere `axis` is an `int` (for 1D) or `tuple` of `int`'s (for 2D/3D)\r\n\r\nThanks to the new generator of core implementation (#880), i am able to skip unpadding when performing global averaging. So this should be faster and memory-efficient, although i haven't formally tested it in practice.\r\n\r\nI have modified the internal values of `average` and the prototype of `core`, but this isn't anything the user accesses directly, so i guess it's fine to break things.\r\n(in fact we've been warning the user against accessing average for several months now. and core is now wrapped inside a unified frontend #908 so i don't see why users would call it directly)\r\n\r\nI have added a simple NumPy test, feel free to request more if you have ideas or specific use cases.","created_at":"2022-08-13T12:21:29Z","updated_at":"2022-08-14T14:38:50Z","closed_at":"2022-08-14T14:38:50Z","merged_at":"2022-08-14T14:38:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5ad3e17eaf21f0458e77d6fe1f85cf773a80ad8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"changhongw","id":37775325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1MzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37775325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw","html_url":"https://github.com/changhongw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1076176420,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDc2MTc2NDIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New
