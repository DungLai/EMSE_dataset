Both cases are working:\r\n\r\n- Set `Q` as an integer: `Q = Q1`. In this case, we use `Q1` wavelets per octave at the first order and that for the second order defaults to one. \r\n- Set `Q` as a tuple: `Q = (Q1, Q2)`, where users can specify both `Q1` and `Q2` according to their needs.","created_at":"2022-06-08T08:24:48Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T13:23:52Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T13:23:52Z","merged_at":"2022-06-17T13:23:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"a776d575aeff2bcefe2b8c002a8da9b492158303","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/milestones/6/labels","id":4908848,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDkwODg0OA==","number":6,"title":"0.3.alpha","description":"","creator":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":13,"closed_issues":30,"state":"open","created_at":"2019-12-06T12:39:56Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T15:35:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/statuses/a578a97ca0d28afea75baf06f36a6ca9489168fe","head":{"label":"changhongw:fix-853","ref":"fix-853","sha":"a578a97ca0d28afea75baf06f36a6ca9489168fe","user":{"login":"changhongw","id":37775325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1MzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37775325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw","html_url":"https://github.com/changhongw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changhongw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https
