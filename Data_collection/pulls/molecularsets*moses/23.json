Now, one should use `scripts/{train.py or sample.py} <model>`with the same arguments.\r\n\r\n* All `moses/<model>/model.py` were refactored, some auxiliary functionality was added.\r\n\r\n* Added support for `--n_workers` argument which specifies a size of Dataloader's workers pool. \r\n\r\n* Models' config arguments' names were revised and unified.\r\n\r\n* Added `ModelsStorage` class which allows to operate with all supported models without additional efforts. Now, to add a new model to MOSES pipeline, one have to add only 2 lines to ModelsStorage code.\r\n\r\n* `scripts/run.py` was refactored.\r\n\r\n* Other tiny fixes and changes (expressions simplification, removing unused imports etc.).\r\n\r\nFor additional details please take a look in the code.","created_at":"2019-01-26T11:27:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T21:26:59Z","closed_at":"2019-02-04T17:00:32Z","merged_at":"2019-02-04T17:00:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b892521bd6d303f1c67df5a51559e5a1b279de98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zhebrak","id":293699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak","html_url":"https://github.com/zhebrak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhebrak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shayakhmetov","id":4422605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4422605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov","html_url":"https://github.com/shayakhmetov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shayakhmetov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/pulls/23/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/pulls/23/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/issues/23/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/molecularsets/moses/statuses/7f44550bc2307afaaf1397ee8a87134867ff7702","head":{"label":"hbq1:interface_unification","ref":"interface_unification","sha":"7f44550bc2307afaaf1397ee8a87134867ff7702","user":{"login":"hbq1","id":6885137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODUxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6885137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1","html_url":"https://github.com/hbq1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166037664,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYwMzc2NjQ=","name":"moses","full_name":"hbq1/moses","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hbq1","id":6885137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODUxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6885137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1","html_url":"https://github.com/hbq1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbq1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hbq1/moses","description":"Molecular
