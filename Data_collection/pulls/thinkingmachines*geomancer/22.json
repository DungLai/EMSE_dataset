It's  around 400 MB so I didn't decide to commit it. My suggestion is that everytime it performs a check, it downloads the `sqlite` file then execute `pytest`\r\n\r\n## Things I need second opinion on:\r\n- How I loaded the spatialite extension in `backend.cores.sqlite`. I used an event listener, not sure if that's the best solution.\r\n- My test cases in `tests.spells.distance_to_nearest`. There should be a better way to do that, not quite sure yet.\r\n\r\nI am also testing on BigQuery, but that can be triggered off via:\r\n\r\n```s\r\n$ pytest -m \"not bqtest\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to run the tests\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that you have the test `.sqlite` file in `tests/data/source.sqlite`. I'll upload this in GCS soon\r\n2.
