This PR will make the debug binary (`lm_xxx.elf`) to print a message that show how much memory will be allocated on the heap **before** calling `Network::init()`. This allows you to have an idea of how much memory will be used and, debug possibly related memory issues.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n- Added a new method to `Network` class that returns the amount of memory in bytes.\r\n- Use this method from `mains/main.cpp` and print how many megabytes will be required by the model.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\nTested with 2 of the provided examples:\r\n- classification: lmnet_quantized_cifar10\r\n- object detection: widerface_v5\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nFor object detection this will show:\r\n```\r\nThis network will try to allocate 10.2753 MB on the heap\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nComparison: Default network test  succeeded!!!\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature / Optimization (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T02:28:40Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T06:48:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac49ec3c3c9e9fb03a0420b2bf4b4f5e9782cb75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1095590113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk1NTkwMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New
