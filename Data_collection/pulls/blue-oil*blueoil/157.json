Motivation and Context\r\nfunction pack_input_to_qwords was buggy.\r\nIt might not write back full data to output.\r\n\r\nSo I fixed it.\r\n\r\nrelated issue #150 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\nchange not to check full length(check if equals to 32) and write back.\r\n\r\nModify to update remainder output after loop-ends.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\nrun on X86 / ARM(without -DUSE_NEON) / FPGA(without -DUSE_NEON)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature / Optimization (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n-
