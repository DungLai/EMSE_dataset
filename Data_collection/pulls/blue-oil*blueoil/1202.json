The point is simply to change the documentation of Blueoil command from `python` (which causes error in the docker container), to `python3`.\r\n\r\nThere is also documentation that mentions `python` in [converter/overview.md](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/master/docs/converter/overview.md), [converter/shared_library.md](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/master/docs/converter/shared_library.md), and several files in docs/tutorial. But in each of those cases, it looks like it is being explained from the perspective of outside a container, where someone would likely be using a python environment etc. So I didn't change the documentation in those cases.\r\n\r\n### testing it out\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it was really necessary, but I ran (using python3, rather than simply python) each of : init, train, convert, predict, export, evaluate, measure_latency, profile_model (for cifar classification), in the style of\r\n```\r\ndocker run --runtime=nvidia -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0\" -e PYTHONPATH=.:lmnet:dlk/python/dlk --rm -it -v `pwd`:/home/blueoil -w /home/blueoil -v <path to dataset dir>:/home/blueoil/dataset:ro --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) <docker image> python3 blueoil/cmd/main.py <specific command>\r\n```\r\n(or in some cases, like blueoil/cmd/\\<specific command\\>.py). They all seemed to run fine.","created_at":"2020-09-11T06:53:35Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T04:48:42Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T04:48:42Z","merged_at":"2020-09-16T04:48:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffc279e7f4fe3e2dd066c1d04492713934a417fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1215364165,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE1MzY0MTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"fbca04","default":true,"description":""},{"id":1446856599,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQ2ODU2NTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/labels/CI:%20auto-run","name":"CI:
