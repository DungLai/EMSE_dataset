Motivation and Context\r\nThis PR is based on #133 \r\n\r\nWe can pre-compute `scale` and `shift` which is used in batch normalization.\r\nSo implement and add new optimization pass. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n　@antonionevado and @nlpng and I implement this PR.\r\n　calculate `shift` and `scale` from `gamma`, `beta`, `mean`, `variance`, `epsilon` in advance.\r\n　and make template file to fit new interface.\r\n　and separate .cpp and .h for batch norm for readability.\r\n\r\nmodified:\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/operators.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/optimizer.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/view.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/scripts/generate_project.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/CMakeLists.txt\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/Makefile.tpl\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/func/batch_normalization.h\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/func/multadd.h\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/func/batch_normalization.cpp\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/func/multadd.cpp\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/network.tpl.cpp\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\nrun on X86 / ARM / FPGA\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature / Optimization (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)","created_at":"2019-02-04T09:32:12Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T05:52:56Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T05:52:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee3674859ed8513ce72d984f93ec79d8424ef44b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1095590113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk1NTkwMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New
