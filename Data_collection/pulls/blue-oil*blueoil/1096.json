However, the dataset hasn't been instantiated, so it can't access the class names.\r\n\r\nOne way around it is to create a dummy dataset, and use the `classes` property of that. But it adds a few lines of code, and creating a dummy dataset only for this purpose is not ideal.\r\n\r\nAnother way (the way in this PR), is to prefer to load `config.yaml`, rather than `config.py`. The `config.yaml` has the full class names directly listed because of [this existing code](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/f57ccf6af2b5fd8210ba255a6ce46e868d9c2677/blueoil/utils/config.py#L224), which is run when doing training.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is very simple, just swapping `config.py` and `config.yaml` in one line changes the order of preference for which one to use (only one is used, not both).\r\n\r\np.s. [\"'config.yaml' is duplication of python config file as yaml.\"](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/f57ccf6af2b5fd8210ba255a6ce46e868d9c2677/blueoil/utils/config.py#L242) so it seems fine to prefer `config.yaml` over `config.py` when running the conversion.\r\n\r\nI tested it by doing training and converting a model similar to `lm_resnet.py`, for Ilsvrc2012 dataset. By doing the change shown in this PR, it could convert.\r\n\r\np.s. the original issue mentions DarknetQuantize. However, after doing the fix in this PR, I still get an error when converting it `AssertionError: Pooling operator pool_1_MaxPool does not match the height: 224 vs 112.` I am pretty sure it is a different error, not related to the issue of loading class names.","created_at":"2020-06-16T13:06:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T23:55:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc58eb8714bdbc9c4ef7ac3e3aca4b367e404324","assignee":{"login":"joelN123","id":32167300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32167300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123","html_url":"https://github.com/joelN123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joelN123","id":32167300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32167300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123","html_url":"https://github.com/joelN123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1446856599,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQ2ODU2NTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/labels/CI:%20auto-run","name":"CI:
