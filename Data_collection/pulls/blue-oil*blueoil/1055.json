So I added a new function that takes the heatmap as input and then returns the colored heatmap. As the function uses numpy, it should be called using `tf.py_func` interface.\r\n\r\nThe table for reference colors is a (256x3) matrix of sRGB colors and I saved it to a separate file `blueoil/turbo_color_map.py`.\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n\r\nRelevant issue: #485
