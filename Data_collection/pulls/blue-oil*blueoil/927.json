Run the upgrade script tf_upgrade_v2\r\n3. convert tf.contrib manually\r\n    * tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm -> tf.compat.v1.layers.batch_normalization\r\n    * tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected -> tf.keras.layers.Dense\r\n4. Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors\r\n5. Run test (make test)\r\n6.
