This PR aims for throwing blueoil config away and unifying 2 types of config format into lmnet config.\r\n\r\n### Important changes\r\n`init.py` is updated to generate lmnet config instead of blueoil config. `generate_lmnet_config.py` and config template files are updated a little according to this change. `train.py` is also updated to accept lmnet config.\r\n- `blueoil/cmd/init.py`\r\n- `blueoil/cmd/train.py`\r\n- `blueoil/generate_lmnet_config.py`\r\n- `blueoil/templates/lmnet/classification.tpl.py`\r\n- `blueoil/templates/lmnet/object_detection.tpl.py`\r\n- `blueoil/templates/lmnet/semantic_segmentation.tpl.py`\r\n\r\n### E2E test updates\r\nThe E2E test code is also updated according to config format updates. The config files for blueoil test are removed and the test scripts are updated to generate them on-the-fly.\r\n- `tests/e2e/conftest.py`\r\n- `tests/e2e/test_classification.py`\r\n-
