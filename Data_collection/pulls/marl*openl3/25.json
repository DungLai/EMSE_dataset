wanted to modify some of the model's parameters so while I was at it, I moved the L3 code into a class which factors out some redundancy between models as well as allows you to modify model parameters using class attributes set before building. \r\n\r\nI left the old methods in btw and just used them to wrap the newer API.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n - you can extend the `OpenL3LinearAudioModel`, `OpenL3Mel128AudioModel`, and `OpenL3Mel256AudioModel` classes to change model parameters\r\n - the final pooling size is now calculated from the final output layer size and the requested embedding size, meaning that other embedding sizes are possible assuming that `embedding_size / n_filter_4` has integer factors and that the factors can divide evenly into the output shape of the final layer. \r\n\r\nSome things that I have yet to do:\r\n - Add docs\r\n - Add specific tests besides what was already in place\r\n - Add constraints to which parameters can be changed","created_at":"2019-05-09T01:38:15Z","updated_at":"2019-05-11T02:14:10Z","closed_at":"2019-05-11T02:14:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e53333479656ebcab0ce8f2ba2597fdb7138a91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/pulls/25/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/pulls/25/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/25/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/statuses/3be5e11e3ad344402262f5f2797ea754c89bfd2a","head":{"label":"beasteers:model_building_classes","ref":"model_building_classes","sha":"3be5e11e3ad344402262f5f2797ea754c89bfd2a","user":{"login":"beasteers","id":6741720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDE3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6741720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers","html_url":"https://github.com/beasteers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185433157,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU0MzMxNTc=","name":"openl3","full_name":"beasteers/openl3","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beasteers","id":6741720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDE3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6741720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers","html_url":"https://github.com/beasteers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beasteers/openl3","description":"OpenL3:
