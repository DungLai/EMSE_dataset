The main outstanding question mentioned on slack is whether the 5 failing tests in `test_constrained.py` and `test_pairwise_null.py` should be deleted.  It seems to me that they are trying to do the impossible by fitting more than one scale parameter but I feel somewhat uncertain here because I have had trouble with constraints before and I am not familiar with Z-tests.  Other than that, feel free to ask why I did anything!","created_at":"2022-07-13T15:11:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T02:41:42Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fbb7dcfc842e095f8a0329f3af5ab955bfbd81d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"picciama","id":50995210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTk1MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50995210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama","html_url":"https://github.com/picciama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picciama/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/pulls/218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/pulls/218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/statuses/ceb79aa896c9791250ff62944f4df788f7d7f99b","head":{"label":"theislab:ig/batchglm_api_update","ref":"ig/batchglm_api_update","sha":"ceb79aa896c9791250ff62944f4df788f7d7f99b","user":{"login":"theislab","id":22319415,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyMzE5NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22319415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139462224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk0NjIyMjQ=","name":"diffxpy","full_name":"theislab/diffxpy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"theislab","id":22319415,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyMzE5NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22319415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theislab/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy","description":"Differential
