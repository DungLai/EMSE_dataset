It should fix an issue uncovered in https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/467 that `plot_spikes`was not showing spikes for intermediate layers. The issue was that the y axis would have a small range around the spikes of the initial data entry, and this range would not cover the full span of possible neurons.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img
