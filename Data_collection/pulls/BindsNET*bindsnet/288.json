Closes #245.\r\n\r\nSimulation is parallelized by creating N copies of neuron state variables (voltages, spike occurrences, refractory period counters, ...) and aggregating changes to adaptive parameters (weights, adaptive thresholds, ...) over the course of simulation. Network now takes an optional argument `batch_size`, to pre-allocate tensors for component state variables.\r\n\r\nInputs to the network now have shape `[time, n_1, ..., n_k]` or `[batch_size, time, n_1, ..., n_k]`. This subsumes the old implementation. If the rank of an input tensor is 2, mini-batch size is assumed to be 1; if the rank of an input tensor is 1, the minibatch size and simulation time are assumed to be 1. If the rank of the input tensor is >= 3, the first dimension is assumed to be the mini-batch size, the second, simulation time, and the rest must match the shape of the corresponding input layer.\r\n\r\nAlso supports \"dynamic batch size\", where, if the input data has minibatch size unequal to what was originally passed, the network re-initializes the component state variables that are sensitive to minibatch size (voltages, spike occurrences, refractory period counters, ...)\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:\r\n- Monitor objects recordings now have shape `[time, batch_size, n_1, ..., n_k]` to match most other parts of the code. This is a change from the old shape, `[n_1, ..., n_k, time]`.\r\n\r\nDesiderata:\r\n- torch.utils.data.DataLoader loads items from our dataset wrappers with shape `[batch_size, time, n_1, ..., n_k]`. I'd prefer this would match the convention `[time, batch_size, n_1, ..., n_k]` in most other parts of the code (CC @k-chaney, any thoughts on this?)\r\n- Aggregation of changes to adaptive parameters (weights, adaptive thresholds, ...) are summed across the minibatch dimension. As we've discussed (@coopersigrist), this makes sense in most cases, but it would be nice to have other aggregation options (e.g., mean, max) which can be passed as an argument to the constructor of a `LearningRule`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I've missed anything, and I'll update this comment accordingly.","created_at":"2019-06-25T15:04:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T13:01:35Z","closed_at":"2019-07-01T13:01:23Z","merged_at":"2019-07-01T13:01:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e1677bb3b5b45b793572db0c68d332b64acb0a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Huizerd","id":15855769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU1NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15855769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd","html_url":"https://github.com/Huizerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huizerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/statuses/6c5d74cc20fd03034334fcb98dbdaffb0048c435","head":{"label":"BindsNET:batching","ref":"batching","sha":"6c5d74cc20fd03034334fcb98dbdaffb0048c435","user":{"login":"BindsNET","id":39340698,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM5MzQwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39340698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120948040,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA5NDgwNDA=","name":"bindsnet","full_name":"BindsNET/bindsnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BindsNET","id":39340698,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM5MzQwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39340698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet","description":"Simulation
