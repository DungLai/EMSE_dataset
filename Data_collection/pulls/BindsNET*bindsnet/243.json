There is a light wrapper around all of the datasets provided by torchvision which should be relatively easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n`spike_encoders.py` houses wrappers around your encoding that are setup to work like the transforms provided by torchvision. Should this live in `bindsnet/datasets` or should it live in `bindsnet/encoding` since these are relatively generic objects?\r\n\r\nThe changes to `bindsnet/network/__init__.py` is motivated by keeping the default pytorch DataLoader which creates (in our case) BxTxCxHxW and having the time dimension be arbitrary seems like a good solution.\r\n\r\nNot everything is implemented yet (hence WIP), but I wanted to make sure this was heading in a direction you guys are comfortable with before spending the time to wrap everything up. The TODO list includes putting spoken_mnist back in, example for a non-convolutional network, update other examples to use this new loading paradigm, work in a dataset that originated as spiking (simply to provide an example from that direction).","created_at":"2019-05-07T23:13:01Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T15:16:45Z","closed_at":"2019-05-22T15:16:45Z","merged_at":"2019-05-22T15:16:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"009a8024beb468c41bd8b00bdaa8a913da2391a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/statuses/119b5a613102a2691903ae43bd50c9b81fc28a57","head":{"label":"k-chaney:chaneyk/dataset_standardization","ref":"chaneyk/dataset_standardization","sha":"119b5a613102a2691903ae43bd50c9b81fc28a57","user":{"login":"k-chaney","id":3302546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3302546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney","html_url":"https://github.com/k-chaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":184496200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODQ0OTYyMDA=","name":"bindsnet","full_name":"k-chaney/bindsnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"k-chaney","id":3302546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3302546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney","html_url":"https://github.com/k-chaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/k-chaney/bindsnet","description":"Simulation
