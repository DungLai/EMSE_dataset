Addresses use cases discussed in #332 and #333. Namely, this adds support for:\r\n\r\n- Incoming connections to `Input` nodes that do something. `Input` nodes now use input from incoming connections instead of discarding it in favor of what's passed by `network.run(inputs=...)`. NB: users have to be a bit more careful with data types in this situation.\r\n- The output of `Input` nodes can now have any type; this subsumes the `RealInput` nodes class, which has been removed as a result.\r\n- Any kind of node can take input passed to `network.run(inputs=...)`. For example, you can create a network with only `LIFNodes` (no `Input` nodes), and inject input directly to them.","created_at":"2019-11-04T02:12:29Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T18:41:09Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T14:47:39Z","merged_at":"2019-11-13T14:47:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ab6d8314310755c18f2a5f474b5d24a2c6a9295","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"k-chaney","id":3302546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3302546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney","html_url":"https://github.com/k-chaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-chaney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"dee0512","id":7398932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTg5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7398932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512","html_url":"https://github.com/dee0512","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dee0512/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"sharath","id":11251260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjUxMjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11251260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath","html_url":"https://github.com/sharath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"coopersigrist","id":44758003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzU4MDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44758003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist","html_url":"https://github.com/coopersigrist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopersigrist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/issues/335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BindsNET/bindsnet/statuses/4ea63adbd3f5e01589e4424d14e6af7470dc03c8","head":{"label":"BindsNET:input","ref":"input","sha":"4ea63adbd3f5e01589e4424d14e6af7470dc03c8","user":{"login":"BindsNET","id":39340698,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM5MzQwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39340698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET","html_url":"https://github.com/BindsNET","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BindsNET/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bi
