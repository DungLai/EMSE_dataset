The main use-case is to be able to match exported data with your existing corpus by providing `external_id` in the imported file, although there are other use-cases. Corresponding issue #45 .\r\n\r\nHere are some comments about this PR:\r\n1. **CSV vs TXT**\r\nIt is not clear for me why we have csv format called a txt format. It is clear that txt format that is described on the \"Import\" page is a subset of the csv. Why don't call it just CSV? That is what I have done. And to preserver previous behaviour I have made the CSV header and text column in it required, unless it is one-column csv (previous txt format). If it is one-column csv it is assumed that the only column is the text column.\r\n\r\n2. **Importing big files**\r\nIn the previous implementation the whole file was read into memory on the import phase. That may cause memory problems with really big files. To mitigate this issue I have made processing of this files to use generators and to use batched creation of the `Document` rows in database. I have made batch size to be configured by the `IMPORT_BATCH_SIZE` setting.\r\n\r\n3. **Error handling** \r\nThere was several places in the code where caught exceptions was not logged anywhere. To fix this I have added logging of them. Also I have added `django.contrib.messages` facilities to the `admin_base` template to show application level errors. For now it is used only for import feature, but I think that there are many other places where it will be appropriate.\r\n\r\n4. **`Project` polymorphism based on its type** (not done)\r\nWe have 3 project types: document classification, sequence labeling and seq2seq. All of this types are represented as a single `Project` class with lots of `if-else`s on project type. It will be more better to use inheritance and `proxy` model to represent these polymorphic relations. It will be easier to extend, write and reason about.","created_at":"2018-12-27T19:27:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T14:53:06Z","closed_at":"2019-01-22T05:50:43Z","merged_at":"2019-01-22T05:50:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7fb32829150c094fd873ea024d7856c24b5d41d","assignee":{"login":"serzh","id":939231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzOTIzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/939231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh","html_url":"https://github.com/serzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"serzh","id":939231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzOTIzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/939231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh","html_url":"https://github.com/serzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serzh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1203581726,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAzNTgxNzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/labels/feature%20request","name":"feature
