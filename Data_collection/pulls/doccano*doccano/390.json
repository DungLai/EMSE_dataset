This saves a database aggregation query.\r\n\r\n- Avoid pulling back the full document from the database on annotation creation (the annotation object only has a link to the document so we can use the document id to create the annotation and don't need to hydrate a full document object reference). This saves a database read that may potentially be expensive if the document is large as we may be pulling back thousands of lines of text from the database into the Django server.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-08T16:10:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T17:21:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T00:24:12Z","merged_at":"2019-11-19T00:24:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1b5e9d5dfb3b0d87795037d0d8e7e4aa33a29e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/pulls/390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/pulls/390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/statuses/b40b2e8f6fa750ff94830eab774d3ec532e11ef3","head":{"label":"CatalystCode:enhancement/improve-annotation-creation-performance","ref":"enhancement/improve-annotation-creation-performance","sha":"b40b2e8f6fa750ff94830eab774d3ec532e11ef3","user":{"login":"CatalystCode","id":12663554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNjYzNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12663554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode","html_url":"https://github.com/CatalystCode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167249267,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjcyNDkyNjc=","name":"doccano","full_name":"CatalystCode/doccano","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CatalystCode","id":12663554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNjYzNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12663554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode","html_url":"https://github.com/CatalystCode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatalystCode/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CatalystCode/doccano","description":"Open
