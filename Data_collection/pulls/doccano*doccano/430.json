The `add_new_superuser_to_projects` functions which grants all superusers the admin role on projects wasn't being exercised for admins that were created before the RBAC functionality was introduced. To backport the RBAC functionality to old instances of doccano, the functionality is now being called on server start when we create the default project roles.\r\n\r\n2. The `get_current_users_role` function had a hard-coded list of roles. To make it easier to add new roles in the future, the function has been refactored to dynamically look up all roles.\r\n\r\nResolves
