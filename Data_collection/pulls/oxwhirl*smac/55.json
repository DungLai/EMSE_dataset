Basically, everything that was provided in the original state, but in a `dict`. The original `get_state()` method simply calls the new `get_state_dict()` method and organizes the information as was done previously.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have devised a way of providing the names of features in lists which are created when the environment is initialized and returned either as class attributes or in `get_env_info()`. These lists are created dynamically (e.g. depending on whether the user has chosen for previous actions to be present in the state, or if units have shields or not, these feature names are either present or not in the lists).\r\n\r\nI myself have been using these modifications for a few months, so I hope they are welcome.\r\n\r\nI also believe this partially addresses #50.","created_at":"2020-07-29T18:50:56Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T09:33:43Z","closed_at":"2021-07-05T09:32:30Z","merged_at":"2021-07-05T09:32:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"f7b68ef7ddc8b3f552336f80a39b70fc7110228b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/pulls/55/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/pulls/55/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/issues/55/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oxwhirl/smac/statuses/9afc1e5476b4c6e7e188a58e069695905dc94390","head":{"label":"douglasrizzo:state_attr_names","ref":"state_attr_names","sha":"9afc1e5476b4c6e7e188a58e069695905dc94390","user":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":244458107,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDQ0NTgxMDc=","name":"smac","full_name":"douglasrizzo/smac","private":false,"owner":{"login":"douglasrizzo","id":2209364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDkzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2209364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo","html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/douglasrizzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/douglasrizzo/smac","description":"SMAC:
