The new loss  produced significantly worse results, so it appears the current method of selecting one anchor from each yolo layer is correct. In the process we did get multi_gpu operational, though not with the speedups expected. We did not attempt to use a multithreaded PyTorch dataloader, nor PIL in place of OpenCV, as we found both of these slower in our single-GPU profiling last year.\r\n\r\nWe don't have multiple gpu machines on premise so we tested this with GCP Deep Learning VMs. We used `batch_size=26` (max that 1 P100 can handle) times the number of GPUs. All other training setting were defaults. We selected the fastest batch out of the first 30 for timing purposes. Results are below for our branch  and the https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/pull/121 PR. In both cases the speedups were very poor. It's possible the IO ops were constrained by GCP due to the limited SSD size, we will try again with a larger SSD but we wanted to get these results out here for feedback. If anyone has another repo or PR we can compare against please let us know!\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/\r\n**Machine type:** n1-highmem-4 (4 vCPUs, 26 GB memory)\r\n**CPU
