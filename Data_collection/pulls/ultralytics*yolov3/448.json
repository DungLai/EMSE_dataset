I trained and tested custom model with custom dataset, I had got NaN loss error during the test.\r\n\r\nThat problem is caused by reject flag that used for model to be trained with object size has proper IOU in training process. \r\n\r\nI removed that flag and condition and then that problem is solved.\r\n\r\nIt seems like to cause NaN loss during the test if we do not have enough anchors to compatible with the size of bounding box in test dataset.\r\n\r\nSo I added the condition to neglect reject flag during the test.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this?","created_at":"2019-08-13T10:30:55Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T20:07:50Z","closed_at":"2019-08-14T14:48:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8ab1fb21934115124b525916dfd80623e003748","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/pulls/448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/pulls/448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/statuses/2369207d92069ac7c70730c3085e9f4b3c64df60","head":{"label":"developer0hye:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"2369207d92069ac7c70730c3085e9f4b3c64df60","user":{"login":"developer0hye","id":35001605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDAxNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35001605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye","html_url":"https://github.com/developer0hye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"ultralytics:master","ref":"master","sha":"907195d77f2ad921cb180c3c454eae1159fa1a21","user":{"login":"ultralytics","id":26833451,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI2ODMzNDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146165888,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYxNjU4ODg=","name":"yolov3","full_name":"ultralytics/yolov3","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ultralytics","id":26833451,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI2ODMzNDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultralytics/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3","description":"YOLOv3
