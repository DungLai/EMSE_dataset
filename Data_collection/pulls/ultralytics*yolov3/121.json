I haven't updated the test.py code yet, but it should be straightforward. I added a new dataset class to implement a standard pytorch dataset class, so I can feed it into a torch.utils.data.DataLoader, to get the benefits of threading. Shuffling is still handled by the dataset class, hence the batch size of 1 and shuffle=False in the dataloader.\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to hear your comments and thanks for your
