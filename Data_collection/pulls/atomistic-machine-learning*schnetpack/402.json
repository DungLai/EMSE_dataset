However, this version does not work with batches of size >1, because I couldn't figure out how to do the broadcasting for the strain. (You need to go from `[batch * 3, 3]` to batch-resolved pairs or positions...)\r\n\r\n[Here's a gist](https://gist.github.com/sirmarcel/7b7f4ddb617c10db4a26dd7e75f1aea5) that computes the stress for a toy LJ example with (a) the standard way of straining the positions/box/offset, (b) straining the pair vectors, (c) directly from the pair vectors, and compares with the analytical form implemented in `ase`. The output is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstrain\r\n[[[ -2.6312544  -2.9801838  -8.266836 ]\r\n  [ -2.9801505  -5.8807836 -13.080653 ]\r\n  [ -8.266743  -13.080667  -33.894806 ]]]\r\n\r\nstrain_rij\r\n[[[ -2.6312795  -2.9801457  -8.266726 ]\r\n  [ -2.9801457  -5.8808045 -13.080628 ]\r\n  [ -8.266726  -13.080628  -33.894817 ]]]\r\n\r\nrij\r\n[[[ -2.6312802  -2.9801457  -8.266726 ]\r\n  [ -2.9801457  -5.880803  -13.0806265]\r\n  [ -8.266726  -13.0806265 -33.89482  ]]]\r\n\r\nase\r\n[[ -2.63129346  -2.98017313  -8.2668025 ]\r\n [ -2.98017313  -5.88085113 -13.08076411]\r\n [ -8.2668025  -13.08076411 -33.89520126]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly, the implementations all work in principle.
