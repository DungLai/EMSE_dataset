Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is.\r\n\r\nA sentence \"123 456 789\" is parsed and gets three words \"123\", \"456\", and \"789\".\r\nI'd like to match a number like\r\n`RegexMatchSpan(rgx=r\"\\d{9}\", sep=\" \")`\r\n\r\nbut sep=\" \" has no effect\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\nFix #270\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nEnable RegexMatchSpan with sep=\"(separator)\" option.\r\nIt concatenates mention spans to one word and does RgexMatch without consideration of the separator.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nAdd Test Code to 'fonduer/tests/candidates/test_matchers.py'.\r\nA sentence \"This is apple\" is parsed and gets 2 2-grams \"This is\" and \"is apple\".\r\nWe can get \"is apple\" with following rgx and sep=\"(space)\" option: \r\n`RegexMatchSpan(rgx=r\"isapple\", sep=\" \")`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my
