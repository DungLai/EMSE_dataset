Please describe.**\r\n\r\nSee #412.\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\n\r\nFix #412.\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nA clear and concise description of what you propose.\r\n\r\nBased on my findings reported at #412, the non-deterministic behaviour in `Featurization` boils down to a non-deterministic behaviour in `VisualLinker`, which is caused by the fact that the order of `doc.sentences` is not deterministic unless `order_by=True` in the `backref` argument below.\r\nhttps://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/246a92dd05884e3a706ba216e6177456d537de13/src/fonduer/parser/models/sentence.py#L248-L252\r\nOne trivial way to fix this issue is to add `order_by=True` to the `backref`, however, I just sort `sentences` (by position) at the beginning of `VisualLinker.link` and I think this is good enough to fix #412.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nA clear and concise description of how you test the new changes.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to test if my change prevents #412 from happening.\r\nHowever, this is not feasible as the issue is **non-deterministic** and does not happen every test run.\r\nInstead, I'd test if the result of visual linker is affected by the order of sentences.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst accordingly.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-16T02:12:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T00:18:39Z","closed_at":"2020-06-17T00:14:23Z","merged_at":"2020-06-17T00:14:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"11f30e47db99b48cdc2cedd4982127615d2b4a4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/statuses/6ab790607ab78e23e19b0895bcb6334cf77ee8e7","head":{"label":"HiromuHota:fix/412","ref":"fix/412","sha":"6ab790607ab78e23e19b0895bcb6334cf77ee8e7","user":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144781473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ3ODE0NzM=","name":"fonduer","full_name":"HiromuHota/fonduer","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota/fonduer","description":":newspaper:
