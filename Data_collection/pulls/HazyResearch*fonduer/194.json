changed the behavior of `get_row_ngrams` and `get_col_ngrams` to return `None`, if a non-table mention is passed (see #186).\r\nI chose `None`, as `[]` can be a valid return value at the moment, e.g. if all other cells in the row of a  `Mention` are empty.\r\n\r\nNote that the current implementation of both functions also work on _candidates_, which will result in a list of ngrams being returned, even if only one of them is inside a table.","created_at":"2018-12-10T14:36:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T19:02:19Z","closed_at":"2018-12-12T19:02:19Z","merged_at":"2018-12-12T19:02:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8f3dd6877fa249528adf326b315a027dc2a6c97","assignee":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":825323858,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjUzMjM4NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
