Please describe.**\r\nMemory leaks happen when Fonduer adds and commits data to postgres after parsing many documents.\r\nThis causes `OOM killer` of Ubuntu and hangup Fonduer process. Please refer to #494.\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\nOne of the memory leak problems is because sqlalchemy keeps all data, which are parsed from documents, on memory untill `commit` from `add`.\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nAdd `commit` to immediately after `add` to free memory (L136 of `src/fonduer/parser/parser.py`).\r\nIâ€™m definitely sure that no side effect happens because no processes exist with the data on the memory after `add` and `commit`.\r\nBy the way, there are two cases doing `commit` after multiple `add`; one is preparing a rollback of inserting data to postgres, and the other is accelerating insert processes for many small data. In contrast, document data in Fonduer are a few large data.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nRun an existing tests (No additional tests).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst accordingly.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-07T00:58:16Z","updated_at":"2021-05-12T07:11:58Z","closed_at":"2021-05-12T07:11:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e765fbdc722462a0a3202f38e86b965faf3a8be0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/statuses/40ce9285a5de322874609b6f5e41eaac654c7000","head":{"label":"YasushiMiyata:feature/#494","ref":"feature/#494","sha":"40ce9285a5de322874609b6f5e41eaac654c7000","user":{"login":"YasushiMiyata","id":67612201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NjEyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67612201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata","html_url":"https://github.com/YasushiMiyata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YasushiMiyata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"HazyResearch:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ab8e9c7bad34ad86800b7b077aa8342f590ec27","user":{"login":"HazyResearch","id":2165246,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxNjUyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2165246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch","html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120036188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjAwMzYxODg=","name":"fonduer","full_name":"HazyResearch/fonduer","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HazyResearch","id":2165246,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxNjUyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2165246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch","html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HazyResearch/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer","description":"A
