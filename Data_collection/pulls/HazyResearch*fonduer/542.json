Please describe.**\r\nSee #534.\r\nThis request redoes #537, which needs prior fixing #538 (fixed by #539).\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\nSee #534\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nIn case of multi line Japanese strings 'AAAA\\nBBBB', spacy[ja] sometimes generates tokens ['AAA', 'AB', 'B', 'BB']. Proposal defines bbox of 'AB' as a multi line word (i.e. left is min left of ['A','B'], top is the top of 'A', right is max right of ['A','B'] and bottom is the bottom of 'B').\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nThis is cause of Japanese morphological analysis. So, I have added Japanese test data to 'tests/data/hocr_simple/japan.hocr' and test code to 'tests/parser/test_parser.py::test_parse_hocr'\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst
