Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs #509 now became a big PR, I'll break it down into smaller PRs.\r\nTo support hOCR (#476), this PR renames `VisualLinker` to `PdfVisualParser` to welcome `HocrVisualParser`, which will be submitted in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\n\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Renamed `VisualLinker` to `PdfVisualParser`, which takes `pdf_path` as an argument\r\n    - `pdf_path` now should be a path to a directory containing PDF files.\r\n    - The PDF file's name should be the same as *document_name* + \".pdf\" (or \".PDF\")\r\n- Changed `Parser`'s signature:\r\n    - Renamed `vizlink` to `visual_parser`.\r\n    - Removed `pdf_path`. Now this is required only by `PdfVisualParser`.\r\n    - Removed `visual`. Use `visual_parser` if visual information is to be parsed.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nA clear and concise description of how you test the new changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the
