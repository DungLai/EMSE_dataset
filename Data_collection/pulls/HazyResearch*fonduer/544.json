Please describe.**\r\nMemory leaks happen when Fonduer adds and commits data to postgres after parsing many documents.\r\nThis causes OOM killer of Ubuntu and hangup Fonduer process. Please refer to #494.\r\n(This PR is redo of #541)\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\nOne of the memory leak problems is because sqlalchemy keeps all data, which are parsed from documents, on memory untill `commit` from `add`.\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nAdd `commit` immediately after `add` to free memory.\r\nhttps://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/b0154c36b4feeda2e81ad7dd9af7062762dad3bf/src/fonduer/parser/parser.py#L135\r\nIâ€™m definitely sure that no side effect happens because no processes exist with the data on the memory after `add` and `commit`.\r\nBy the way, there are two cases doing `commit` after multiple `add`; one is preparing a rollback of inserting data to postgres, and the other is accelerating insert processes for many small data. In contrast, document data in Fonduer are a few large data.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nRun an existing tests (No additional tests).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst
