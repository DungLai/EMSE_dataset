adapt train_segmentation.py and inference_segmentation.py to new usage\r\n- move state_dict_path param to default_training.yaml\r\n- implement unit tests for model_choice.py functions\r\n- read_checkpoint(): add robustness (covers external checkpoints with only model weights, and complies to torch's save key naming standard 'model_state_dict' and 'optimizer_state_dict' rather than gdl's 'model' and 'optimizer' keys while being retrocompatible to old gdl models\r\n- create high level define_model() function using all low level models definition/loading functions from
