These values should not be computed from input. (19 nov 12:24)\r\n- copy .yaml to log files\r\n- extend use of pathlib (delete create_or_empty_folder function in utils.py)\r\n- move reader functions in utils.py to readers.py in utils folder\r\n- add verifications.py with functions to check validity of features in vector files (for example)\r\n- in images_to_samples.py, loop through images and gpkg in .csv to validate their existence. Then validate features in gpkg.\r\n- samples folder named with sample parameters. All models derived from particular samples are saved **within** this folder.\r\n- in images_to_samples.py, show number of samples prepared vs number of potential samples\r\n- in images_to_samples, if min_annotated_percent is 0, samples will be created (l.117). \"<=\" replaced \"<\".\r\n- correct bug with HPC and forcing device to cuda:0\r\n- in report_classification, ignore predictions with class \"ignore_index\"\r\n- Change parameter «sample/samp_dist» to «sample/overlap» to make uniform with inference.py. Also more intuitive. (issue #111 )\r\n- samples folder create with info about parameters used (sample_size, overlap, etc.)\r\n- manage trainings if no test data (issue #108 )\r\n- bug fix at inference: don't chop image on right and bottom\r\n- getkeydef() function: If key exists but no value is provided, set default value.\r\n- visualisation: à partir d'un dataloader, d'une batch (input/output) et d'un input/output individuel (donc n'importe où dans le code)\r\n\t- création des heatmaps\r\n\t- sur un subset d'échantillons\r\n- bug fix: num_classes + 1 for train and inference in semantic segmentation tasks. (issue #98 )\r\n- model is saved under samples folder, not data_path\r\n- add info about hdf5 path in SegmentationDataset (CreateDataset.py)\r\n- bug fix: per class metrics integrating ignore_index
