It arrises because the algorithm checks the number of tokens in parenthses and, if there are more than three, assumes the 'long form' is in the parenthses (line 110 of abbreviations.py). A short form with a space and quote marks is four spacy tokens, so falls into this case.\r\n\r\nThis proposed fix works by adjusting the short form start / end indexes where the short form includes quotes. This follows the current implementation, but makes the adjustment outside the else statement (line 116 of abbreviation.py).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-16T16:39:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-01T13:12:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-01T13:12:03Z","merged_at":"2020-03-01T13:12:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1e7d2b91a596218052ea96d60d31383afa61846","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/pulls/16/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/pulls/16/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/16/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/statuses/87435c60ef5c141d3badda1300f4c10885f6b676","head":{"label":"richardbatstone:Issue-4-abbreviation-detection","ref":"Issue-4-abbreviation-detection","sha":"87435c60ef5c141d3badda1300f4c10885f6b676","user":{"login":"richardbatstone","id":36573392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTczMzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36573392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone","html_url":"https://github.com/richardbatstone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":238959575,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzg5NTk1NzU=","name":"Blackstone","full_name":"richardbatstone/Blackstone","private":false,"owner":{"login":"richardbatstone","id":36573392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTczMzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36573392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone","html_url":"https://github.com/richardbatstone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardbatstone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/richardbatstone/Blackstone","description":":black_circle:
