I believe Pyro calls it \"interception\", but that's even less clear...).  Basically, it lets you take repeated random samples from the posterior - but they're the same random sample!  For example, normally getting posterior samples gets you, you know, *samples* (i.e. they're different):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nparam = pf.Parameter()\r\nx1 = param.posterior_sample()\r\nx2 = param.posterior_sample()\r\nassert x1 != x2  # they're not the same!  obviously!\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut using the new `pf.Sampling(static=True)` context manager:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx1 = param.posterior_sample()\r\nwith pf.Sampling(static=True):\r\n    x2 = param.posterior_sample()\r\n    x3 = param.posterior_sample()\r\nassert x1 != x2  # we are taking a random sample (i.e. it's different from MAP)\r\nassert x2 == x3  # but those samples are the same w/i context manager!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was inspired by some reinforcement learning applications: when we're doing Thompson sampling, we want to take the *same* posterior sample over the course of a trial, even though we have to take multiple samples and can't just do it in one big batch (b/c we have to take the sample, then run the environment simulation / actually see what happens before taking the next sample).  For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i in range(n_trials):\r\n\r\n    # Take the same posterior sample at each timestep in this trial\r\n    # even though we're calling epistemic_sample multiple times!\r\n    with pf.Sampling(static=True):\r\n\r\n        for t in range(n_timesteps):\r\n\r\n            r_hat = model.epistemic_sample(state_action_pairs)\r\n\r\n            # select action w/ best r_hat\r\n\r\n            # update state/reward according to action\r\n\r\n    # update model\r\n```","created_at":"2020-12-31T07:31:58Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T02:36:46Z","closed_at":"2021-01-01T02:36:45Z","merged_at":"2021-01-01T02:36:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c466144e4ac562362336c345fe06001534f4fc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/pulls/51/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/pulls/51/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/issues/51/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/brendanhasz/probflow/statuses/113c4e9aec371e8299a0d8a51d27cb95a2762446","head":{"label":"brendanhasz:static-posterior-sampling","ref":"static-posterior-sampling","sha":"113c4e9aec371e8299a0d8a51d27cb95a2762446","user":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":164249963,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjQyNDk5NjM=","name":"probflow","full_name":"brendanhasz/probflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brendanhasz","id":3465846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjU4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz","html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendanhasz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brendanhasz/probflow","description":"A
