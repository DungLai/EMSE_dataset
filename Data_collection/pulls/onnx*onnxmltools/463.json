However, that seems to involve quite some changes in `onxx`/`onnxruntime`. If anybody knows how to move these changes upstream, that would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR is still missing is tests. I have tested this locally, asserting that the predictions of the LightGMB model and the ONNX model are equivalent. I don't see an easy way to add this to your test suite, though. Some advice on this would be great.","created_at":"2021-05-11T09:37:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T09:21:54Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T16:37:13Z","merged_at":"2021-05-20T16:37:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd044d7d0c675d3d480b033c25ceff4c2d2b4080","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/pulls/463/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/pulls/463/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/463/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/statuses/5b59425e9517a17f8bb2e612171e3d1d1cd0ec94","head":{"label":"janjagusch:allow-for-custom-post-transform-functions","ref":"allow-for-custom-post-transform-functions","sha":"5b59425e9517a17f8bb2e612171e3d1d1cd0ec94","user":{"login":"janjagusch","id":25852654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODUyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25852654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch","html_url":"https://github.com/janjagusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":365962827,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjU5NjI4Mjc=","name":"onnxmltools","full_name":"janjagusch/onnxmltools","private":false,"owner":{"login":"janjagusch","id":25852654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODUyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25852654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch","html_url":"https://github.com/janjagusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/janjagusch/onnxmltools","description":"ONNXMLTools
