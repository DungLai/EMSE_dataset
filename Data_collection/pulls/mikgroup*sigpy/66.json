I tracked down the problem to a reference to the ESPIRiT app that is passed to the PowerMethod alg.\r\n\r\nThe following code shows that there is memory that remains allocated even when the ESPIRiT app is done and no longer referenced.\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport cupy as cp\r\nimport sigpy as sp\r\nfrom sigpy.mri.app import EspiritCalib\r\n\r\n\r\ndef my_function():\r\n    # Putting code in function so variables go out of scope automatically\r\n    device = sp.Device(0)\r\n    ksp = sp.util.randn((4, 128, 128, 128), dtype=np.complex64, device=device)\r\n\r\n    app = EspiritCalib(ksp, device=device)\r\n\r\n    mps = app.run()\r\n\r\n    # app.alg = None  # This would release memory properly\r\n    return\r\n\r\n\r\ndef print_mem():\r\n    with cp.cuda.Device(0):\r\n        mempool = cp.get_default_memory_pool()\r\n        # Memory in MB\r\n        used = mempool.used_bytes() / 1024 / 1024\r\n        total = mempool.total_bytes() / 1024 / 1024\r\n        print(used, 'MB USED')\r\n        print(total, 'MB RESERVED')\r\n\r\n\r\nprint_mem()\r\nmy_function()\r\nprint_mem()\r\n\r\n```\r\nDereferencing the alg manually can also correctly release the no longer used memory. With my fix in the PR, running the above code will show that memory used is 0 after the app is finished.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to
