I have not modified any other functions yet as I wanted to run this by you first. The main goal of this commit is to use PyWavelet's wavelet coefficients to perform n-dimensional forward and inverse wavelet transforms using generic numpy/cupy functions. This should hopefully allow for wavelet to be used directly on the GPU. (I have not tested this on the GPU yet, but will be soon.) The main question I wanted to ask is the following: To ease n-dimensional processing, fwt returns a dictionary that iwt takes as input. Is this okay?","created_at":"2019-11-08T20:08:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T02:07:16Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T02:07:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d92a1888dbc49d3b72ef757df9a33d9a0a78983c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/pulls/31/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/pulls/31/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/issues/31/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikgroup/sigpy/statuses/5bd25cdfda5b72c2728993ad5e6f7288f274ddc4","head":{"label":"sidward:master","ref":"master","sha":"5bd25cdfda5b72c2728993ad5e6f7288f274ddc4","user":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154343922,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQzNDM5MjI=","name":"sigpy","full_name":"sidward/sigpy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sidward","id":7364812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQ4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward","html_url":"https://github.com/sidward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sidward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sidward/sigpy","description":"Python
