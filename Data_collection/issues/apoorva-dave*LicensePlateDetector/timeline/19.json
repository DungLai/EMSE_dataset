@moxgeek ,\r\nI guess the problem is due to binarization of graysacle image. In this code the method of binarization used is otsu. Otsu finds a suitable mean value to binarize the pixels in image.\r\nFor example, in a grayscale image pixel intensity is highest at 0 and 255, then otsu will say all values before 127 will be black and all values after 127 will be white, this value 127 is called retVal, so in simple thresholding we decide the retval whereas in otsu, retval is decided by machine seeing the histogram of pixel intensity. \r\nNow coming to this problem some of the colours of car like gray , darkgray, lightgray, silver have respective values as 128, 169, 211, 192 which are towards peak of white so when otsu will binarize these colours it will put it in category of white and hence the number plate will get mix with the car colour. \r\n\r\nComing to the solution for gray, silver and other colours u can solve the problem by keeping the retval as 249. But for white the problem may persist. Also, if by chance, the number plate looks a little darker in scene due to shadow then it will again be not detected as it wont be 255 on grayscale. \r\n\r\nSo, universal solution is either to use adaptive thresholding, which is a function of cv2 as well as skimage just like otsu, or i suggest u to first perform car detection followed by number plate detection with some suitable CNN and then perform component analysis once number plate is getting detected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/comments/654611945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KunikaValecha","id":34136027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTM2MDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34136027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha","html_url":"https://github.com/KunikaValecha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3518688010,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUxODY4ODAxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/events/3518688010","actor":{"login":"moxgeek","id":10207671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10207671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek","html_url":"https://github.com/moxgeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-07T05:31:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3518688012,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MTg2ODgwMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/events/3518688012","actor":{"login":"moxgeek","id":10207671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10207671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek","html_url":"https://github.com/moxgeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moxgeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-07T05:31:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/comments/654669534","html_url":"https://github.com/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/19#issuecomment-654669534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apoorva-dave/LicensePlateDetector/issues/19","id":654669534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDY2OTUzNA==","user":{"login":"KunikaValecha","id":34136027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTM2MDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34136027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha","html_url":"https://github.com/KunikaValecha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KunikaValecha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T07:55:50
