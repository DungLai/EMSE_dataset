I should mention that I am using PIL version 5.3.0.post0.\r\n\r\nI believe that bilinear is the default in PyTorch transforms (https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/transforms/transforms.py#L182) and it seems this repository is using the default (https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/benchmarking-keras-pytorch/blob/master/imagenet_pytorch_get_predictions.py#L95). It's interesting to note the difference when using bicubic though. \r\n\r\nI've also seen variation with different CUDA versions and other setup differences similar to what you're describing. I've seen, for example, a full percentage point drop when using OpenCV's implementation bilinear resizing, as compared to PIL. I was unaware, though, that there could be a full percentage point drop from such setup differences in this kind of more constrained setting (using PyTorch/CUDA/PIL). I found this especially worth highlighting since this repo's evaluation seems to be off by enough that densenet169 performs worse than ResNet-50 in my setup.\r\n\r\nEdit: It's worth noting that many such differences due to subtle changes in preprocessing implementations can be eliminated (if need be for a production use case) by fine tuning with a low learning rate for several epochs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cgnorthcutt/benchmarking-keras-pytorch/issues/comments/482457547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ankmathur96","id":8398819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96","html_url":"https://github.com/ankmathur96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankmathur96/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cgnorthcutt/benchmarking-keras-pytorch/issues/comments/482465660","html_url":"https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/benchmarking-keras-pytorch/issues/3#issuecomment-482465660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cgnorthcutt/benchmarking-keras-pytorch/issues/3","id":482465660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjQ2NTY2MA==","user":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T07:15:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T07:15:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ankmathur96 yeah, I noticed when I was doing my benchmarking in the past that most of the resnet/densenet models in torchvision were better with the default bilinear, but a number of the ported models, Inception variants, DPN, etc were doing better with bicubic. \r\n\r\nFine-tuning can definitely help with these sorts of issues if/when it matters.
