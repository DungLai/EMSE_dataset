Im trying to understand the mathematics behind the ArcFace in your implementation. \r\nBut when I read to this line the **metrics.py**\r\n` logits = logits * (1 - y) + target_logits * y`\r\nI don't understand the link behind this line and the original paper. The code looks like the cross entropy loss before going to the Softmax function, but if if the cross entropy, should it have the log inside? AIm not sure about this part very much. Can you help me to understand it?\r\n\r\nMany thanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4uiiurz1/keras-arcface/issues/19/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4uiiurz1/keras-arcface/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
