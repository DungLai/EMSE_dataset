I'm starting to work on it [at a fork](https://github.com/tiagoshibata/onnxmltools). My goal is to have model metadata and [type denotation](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/TypeDenotation.md) automatically added if the source model declares the input as an image.\r\n\r\nI am doing the work on CoreML conversion. Is it a desired feature?
