Create a Keras model.\r\n\r\nUse the following code:\r\n\r\n    inputs = Input(shape=(100, 2))\r\n    pool1 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(inputs)\r\n    conv1 = Conv1D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')(pool1)\r\n    up1 = UpSampling1D(size=2)(conv1)\r\n    concat1 = Concatenate()([inputs, up1])\r\n    kerasModel = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=concat1)`\r\n\r\nYou can find it as `Fail_Keras.hdf5` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1-ZJqKN0ROPuoGRiNuH1PdBwQPIUiCu).\r\n\r\nStep 2. Convert the Keras model to Onnx.\r\n\r\nI'm using keras2onnx 1.8.0 revision=4edf53c.\r\n\r\n    onnxModel = onnxmltools.convert_keras(kerasModel, target_opset=12)\r\n\r\nWe obtain a pretty valid onnx model. You can find it as `Fail_FP32_Onnx.onnx` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1-ZJqKN0ROPuoGRiNuH1PdBwQPIUiCu).\r\n\r\nStep 3. Convert the FP32 Onnx model to FP16.\r\n\r\nI'm using onnxmltools 1.8.0 revision=ccddab5.\r\n\r\n    onnxModelFP16 = convert_float_to_float16(onnxModel);\r\n\r\nConversion completes successfully, and we have a `Fail_FP16_Onnx.onnx` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1-ZJqKN0ROPuoGRiNuH1PdBwQPIUiCu). But now there is a problem since there are two inputs for `Concat` layer, one of them is FP32, and another is FP16, and `Concat` receives only FP16 inputs.\r\n![fail](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Hq5Bv_9bzShFnDIm9PE_CDsG5wTUghBR).\r\n\r\nWhen we try to load the model by OnnxRuntime the following exception is thrown: `Type Error: Type parameter (T) bound to different types (tensor(float16) and tensor(float) in node (concatenate).`\r\n\r\nThe problem is somehow caused by the presence of the `Conv` layer (a blue layer on the picture above), because, if we create a Keras model without the convolution layer and make all the same conversions, then we obtain the following FP16 onnx model:\r\n![success](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1pz7kQxM5t1BjPQPIBeo6V5lVkVGSK995).\r\n\r\nHere we see that after `Resize` `Cast` operation appears, which is missing in the previous model. It converts FP32 input to FP16 output, so `Concat` layer now obtains two inputs in FP16.\r\n\r\nYou can find these \"good\" models as `Success_Keras.hdf5`, `Success_FP32_Onnx.onnx` and `Success_FP16_Onnx.onnx` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1-ZJqKN0ROPuoGRiNuH1PdBwQPIUiCu).\r\n\r\nCould you please take a look at this issue?","closed_by":{"login":"ynborokh","id":16271195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjcxMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16271195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh","html_url":"https://github.com/ynborokh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ynborokh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
