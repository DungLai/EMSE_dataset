With Hummingbird version 0.0.3 we have brought initial support for [ONNX models] (https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird/pull/142) (generated by the LightGBM convert). The integration will allow users of the LightGBM convert to have ONNX graphs without any ONNXML operator, meaning the model can be run over hardware accelerators. \r\n\r\nHummingbird runs over python =>3.5 and for Win, Mac and Linux. We have already tested our ONNX support with the [LightGBM convert tests](https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird/blob/master/tests/test_onnxml_converter_lightgbm.py) so there should be no technical blocker. @ksaur ","closed_by":{"login":"wenbingl","id":10278425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc4NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10278425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl","html_url":"https://github.com/wenbingl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/403/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
