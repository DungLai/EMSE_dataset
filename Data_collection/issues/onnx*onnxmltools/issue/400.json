Checking the source code I have noticed that the file \"_parse.py\" does not support \"multi:softmax\", but only \"multi:softprob\". Indeed, the predictions are all logits and not the actual classes. The predictions I get with \"multi:softmax\" are exactly the same the ones I get by using \"multi:softprob\". I think the \"multi:softmax\" gets overridden automatically by ONNX. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nPaolo\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 18.04, I am using: \r\nonnx==1.7.0\r\nxgboost==1.1.0\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wenbingl","id":10278425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc4NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10278425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl","html_url":"https://github.com/wenbingl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenbingl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
