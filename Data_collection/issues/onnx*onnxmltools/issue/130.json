How can I eliminate those \"Transpose\" ops?\r\n\r\nHere is the plotted keras and ONNX model:\r\n[keras](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5886506/44519642-340e6f80-a700-11e8-8243-8cc387132bad.png)\r\n[onnx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5886506/44519643-340e6f80-a700-11e8-96ee-bd39ae502011.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yanghanxy","id":5886506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODY1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5886506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghanxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghanxy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
