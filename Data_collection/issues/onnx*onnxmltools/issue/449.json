When I invoke convert_sparkml function I get an error that says that 'pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF' is not supported.\r\n\r\nI was looking into the source code and I discovered that 'pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF' is a transformer built into **get_sparkml_operator_name** (inside ops_names.py) but later it doesn't appear into the map created in **get_input_names** function (that is inside ops_input_output.py), that is where it is check if a transformer/estimator is valir or not. Does this have any explanation why it is not supported? Or is a bug?\r\n\r\nAny help is well appreciated.
