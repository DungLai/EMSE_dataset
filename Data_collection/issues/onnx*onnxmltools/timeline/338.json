The original LightGBM converter only support models obtained from scikit-learn interface, and only the regressor and classifier. By the time when I contribute the Booster converter, I reused the code for the regressor and classifier. Since many other objectives and features are not tested, I did not allow conversion of those models.\r\n\r\nI believe conversion from the LightGBM booster model is the way to go, and I am working on that. Can you confirm that, in your case, simply bypassing the objective check does not yield different results? If so, I can add some minimal testcases and relax the restriction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/543265896/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hongzmsft","id":53948420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQ4NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53948420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft","html_url":"https://github.com/hongzmsft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hongzmsft/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2722035678,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjcyMjAzNTY3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2722035678","actor":{"login":"sheon-han-zocdoc","id":29129916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTI5OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29129916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc","html_url":"https://github.com/sheon-han-zocdoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-17T16:53:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2722035681,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3MjIwMzU2ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2722035681","actor":{"login":"sheon-han-zocdoc","id":29129916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTI5OTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29129916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc","html_url":"https://github.com/sheon-han-zocdoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheon-han-zocdoc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-17T16:53:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/649513501","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/338#issuecomment-649513501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/338","id":649513501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTUxMzUwMQ==","user":{"login":"go2ready","id":7985443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODU0NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7985443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready","html_url":"https://github.com/go2ready","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go2ready/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-25
