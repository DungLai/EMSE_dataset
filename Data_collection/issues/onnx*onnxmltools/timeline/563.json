@RayTsui, definitely. When you call `convert_sparkml`, the code parses the `sparkml_model`, and sees a `GBTClassificationModel`. It then tries to convert the gbt classification model into ONNX, during which it calls `save_read_sparkml_model_data` function inside \"tree_ensemble_common.py\".\r\n\r\nThe `save_read_sparkml_model_data` function in turn calls `spark.util.Utils.createTempDir().getAbsolutePath()`. But SparkSession has no attribute `util`. I couldn't find any Spark code that calls this function in either Spark2 or Spark3. I suspect that this was intended to call [this function](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4be566062defa249435c4d72eb106fe7b933e023/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/Utils.scala#L329) through py4j.\r\n\r\nSo the fix is to do exactly that -
