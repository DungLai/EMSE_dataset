Are you thinking about running a chain in the ONNX model, or about using a MAP estimate from a completed Bayesian inference step to then perform inference on new points. The latter seems easier, but I'm not sure if the full space of Stan models could be mapped down. For example I've previously done work on inference in topic models (which I know is not Stan's strength) and ONNX doesn't support things like the gamma function that you need to work with Dirichlet and Beta distributions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/1133123380/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Craigacp","id":729696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTY5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/729696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp","html_url":"https://github.com/Craigacp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Craigacp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/1135409754","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/549#issuecomment-1135409754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/549","id":1135409754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB0J-H85DrPpa","user":{"login":"bparbhu","id":7581178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODExNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7581178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu","html_url":"https://github.com/bparbhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bparbhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-24T04:59:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T04:59:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So I have heard something similar from someone on the Stan development team as well. I think we would ideally want to have the ability to do both things with a Stan model but if you have limited functionality with the saved Stan model, then I think this wouldn't be a worthwhile effort. I always wondered why Onnx never supported LDA models as well, so thanks for letting me know about that. I actually worked on a project where we were trying to get that functionality for Onnx models as part of a chatbot.
