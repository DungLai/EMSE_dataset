again. \r\n\r\nThank you for having taken this into account.\r\n\r\nI have made a trial with the master branch. It appears that the padding size array is now filled properly with zeroes. Nevertheless, the padding value that is associated is still -3.4e+38. \r\n\r\nIn principle, it should not cause any trouble, except that TensorRT which is my target rejects the padding operator if value is not zero... So the generated file still cannot be loaded as is.\r\n\r\nI just made a trial (just a trial because this is probably not the right solution), removing the conditional expression on line 252 of file convert/coreml/operator_converters/neural_network/Pool.py, making \"padded_value\" always being 0.\r\n\r\nThis solves the issue with TensorRT.\r\n\r\nMay-be this can be considered an issue for TensorRT and not onnxmltools, but modifying the behaviour to have a value of 0 when padding sizes are 0 would avoid a lot of headaches !\r\n\r\nNote that my current target is TensorRT 7.0.0.11 for Windows.
