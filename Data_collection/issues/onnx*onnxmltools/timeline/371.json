your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am creating models with sklearn + xgboost and in particular using the `OneHotEncoder` of sklearn and generating onnx models using sklearn-onnx. \r\n\r\nOne hot encoding using sparse matrix as output results in much 10x faster training with `XGBRegressor`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if I let the encoder output sparse matrix, onnxruntime gives incorrect values (see https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/371 for details).\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't use sparse matrix, then everything work as expected.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- ONNX Runtime version (you are using): v1.1.2\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI see two incremental solutions:\r\n- first onnxruntime should fail when using sparse matrix since it doesn't support them.\r\n- second onnxruntime should support sparse matrix so that we can have more efficient training and predicting\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nNot using sparse matrix, but as I said it is incredibly slow compared to using them.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure sparse tensor are meant to be supported or not by onnx, see

this is present in the documentation it could be that I'm misunderstanding the expected behaviour, but it looks like use of one-hot-encoding results in different predictions between sklearn pipelines and generated onnx models. \r\n\r\nThe example in the documentation is the titanic pipeline example [here](http://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/auto_examples/plot_complex_pipeline.html#compare-the-predictions). The predicted outputs shown are:\r\n\r\n**Sklearn predictions:**\r\n```\r\npredict [0 0 1 0 0]\r\npredict_proba [[0.65654207 0.34345793]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Onnx predictions:**\r\n```\r\npredict [1 0 1 0 0]\r\npredict_proba [{0: 0.4371914267539978, 1: 0.5628085732460022}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can replicate this using the example locally and have also encountered similar behaviour in my own converted pipeline. In both cases if I remove the categorical features and transformer from the pipeline I get identical predictions (within double/float precision) between sklearn and onnx models, which makes me think the root of the difference is in the OHE.\r\n\r\nI see from other issues (https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/371) that Sklearn's default use of sparse representations can cause issues with OHE in onnx if not disabled. In this case using Sparse representation or not has no effect on the outcome (identical predictions without OHE, different predictions with it).\r\n\r\nPackage versions I used to replicate this are:\r\n```\r\nnumpy: 1.15.4\r\nscikit-learn: 0.24.2\r\nonnx:  1.8.0\r\nonnxruntime:  1.1.2\r\nskl2onnx:  1.8.0\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
