The example is working well in SageMaker. I've load the model successfully by using `pickle` and `joblib`. But it's shown error, when I'm going to convert the model to onnx using `sklearn-onnx`. Please take a look at the attached images for more details about the error.\r\n\r\n![sklearn-onnx #1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25961704/69671898-89040880-105c-11ea-9e06-1bc0534a99ac.png)\r\n![sklearn-onnx #2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25961704/69671899-899c9f00-105c-11ea-911e-8dde494d656e.png)\r\n\r\nCould you please take a look at the issues and let me know a way to solve the issues?
