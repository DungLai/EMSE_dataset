I was trying to set up a deployment pipeline for production system. My thoughts were to accept any onnx model (to keep it easy for other model developers) and convert them to tensorflow to deploy them for example to tf serving. So I want to use onnx just as a model converter. \r\nIn my current keras model I want to accept base64 images and do all of the work in the serving container. I know that the conversion from keras weights to tf serving is done quickly, but I was thinking of a generalized solution to be framework independent. \r\n\r\nBut if there are operations which are currently not supported, I need to think of another solution, until onnx is providing all of the needed
