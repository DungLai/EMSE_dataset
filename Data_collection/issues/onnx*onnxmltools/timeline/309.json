To my best knowledge, I do not think there is a way to convert categorical features without getting hands dirty.\r\n\r\nLightGBM model dump represent splits on categorical features as vertical-bar-separated strings consisting of category indices. In order to express this in ONNX, the node should take either the strings as-is or bit-encoded integers. My understanding is that ONNX does not support expressing such tree models yet.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do that is to map categorical features to some float numbers for each tree before feeding into tree operator. Well, that's quite a lot of features to
