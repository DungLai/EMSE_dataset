I'd encourage you to contribute to the community tools in onnxmltools once you've gotten it working.\r\n> \r\n> @stevenlix, any insight here?\r\n\r\nI got the following code but when I convert the ONNX model to Tensorflow it still acts like it is an INT64, although Netron says it's a float16, but I think this is due to the data still being in INT64 but I only managed to change they dtype parameter to float64 without changing the data itself.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11189629/59390043-fcbb8e80-8d24-11e9-8d63-2d7176b7b459.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\n            int_list = _npfloat16_to_int(np.float16(tensor.float_data))\r\n            tensor.int32_data[:] = int_list\r\n            tensor.float_data[:] = []\r\n        if tensor.int64_data:\r\n            int_list = _npfloat16_to_int(tensor.int64_data.astype(np.float16)) # np.int32(tensor.int64_data).astype(numpy.float32)\r\n            tensor.int32_data[:] = int_list\r\n            tensor.int64_data[:] = []\r\n        # convert raw_data (bytes type)\r\n        if tensor.raw_data:\r\n            # convert n.raw_data to float\r\n                    if n.type.tensor_type.elem_type == onnx_proto.TensorProto.FLOAT:\r\n                        n.type.tensor_type.elem_type = onnx_proto.TensorProto.FLOAT16\r\n                        value_info_list.append(n)\r\n                    if n.type.tensor_type.elem_type == onnx_proto.TensorProto.INT64:\r\n                        n.type.tensor_type.elem_type = onnx_proto.TensorProto.FLOAT16\r\n                        value_info_list.append(n)\r\n            # if q is node.attribute, process node.attribute.t and node.attribute.tensors (TensorProto)\r\n            if isinstance(q, onnx_proto.AttributeProto):\r\n                for n in itertools.chain(q.t, q.tensors):\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I just need to change the data, but I don't know how to test this correctly.\r\n\r\nBut I discovered that OpenCV (the framework where I load the ONNX model in) doesn't accept float16 models so I will make another converter that will convert only int64's to float32's!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/501475526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Aeroxander","id":11189629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTg5NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11189629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander","html_url":"https://github.com/Aeroxander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2408869780,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQwODg2OTc4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408869780","actor":{"login":"Aeroxander","id":11189629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTg5NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11189629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander","html_url":"https://github.com/Aeroxander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-12T22:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2408869781,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MDg4Njk3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408869781","actor":{"login":"Aeroxander","id":11189629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTg5NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11189629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander","html_url":"https://github.com/Aeroxander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-12T22:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2408869782,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQwODg2OTc4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408869782","actor":{"login":"stevenlix","id":38092805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDkyODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38092805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenlix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-12T22:19:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2408869783,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MDg4Njk3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408869783","actor":{"login":"st

I understand that with changing the elem_type only Netron will show it as a float16, so I would think int_list would change the data..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/comments/501485876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Aeroxander","id":11189629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTg5NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11189629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander","html_url":"https://github.com/Aeroxander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aeroxander/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2408944317,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQwODk0NDMxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408944317","actor":{"login":"stevenlix","id":38092805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDkyODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38092805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenlix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-12T23:05:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2408944318,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MDg5NDQzMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/onnxmltools/issues/events/2408944318","actor":{"login":"stevenlix","id":38092805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDkyODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38092805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenlix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenlix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-12T23:05:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
