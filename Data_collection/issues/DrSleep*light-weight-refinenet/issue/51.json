There is no BatchNorm neither in original RefineNet architecture, but it can be a historical reason... Maybe you've tested your architecture with batch norms in MRF and CRP blocks and have a conclusion on that ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"vfdev-5","id":2459423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTk0MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2459423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5","html_url":"https://github.com/vfdev-5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vfdev-5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
