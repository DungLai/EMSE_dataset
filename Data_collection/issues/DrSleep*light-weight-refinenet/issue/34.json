Your tutorial to reproduce the results is very detailed, and I appreciate it a lot.\r\n\r\nI am trying to use your code in my research project. First I tried to re-train the network on NYUD with the provided code, the IoU is 0.419 which is fine. Then I tried to visualize the prediction as you did in the notebook. But the result looks pretty bad, and I don't know why the predicted mask image is green.\r\n\r\nI tried evaluation with given weight file and the file I trained myself, the difference is huge as follows. The only difference I made in the code between two result figures is loading different weight file.\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea why this could happen?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"983\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 10 58 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32805298/56404661-866f4400-622d-11e9-834c-d5ddd37b437b.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st2yang","id":32805298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODA1Mjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32805298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang","html_url":"https://github.com/st2yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st2yang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
