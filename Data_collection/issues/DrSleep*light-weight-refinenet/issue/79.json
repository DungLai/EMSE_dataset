What is the function of this transposition operation? Do I need to transpose my change detection dataset? \r\n\r\nWhen I used your code for change detection, at a few hundred iters in the first epoch, there was a huge lossï¼Œand the precision of the validation is always 0. I'm not clear where the problem is.\r\n\r\nVery much looking forward to your answer, thank you and all the best!","closed_by":{"login":"yiyi-today","id":57097748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDk3NzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57097748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today","html_url":"https://github.com/yiyi-today","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyi-today/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
