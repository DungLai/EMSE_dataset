Is the code you have posted suitable to be adapted to extract building footprints from aerials?  I know that I would have to prepare aerial image and mask chips for the training and validation data that fit the code's input requirements, but are there other changes that would have to be made to this code or its inputs to make this work for the task of segmenting building footprints?\r\n\r\nI realize this code does not account for several aspects of the problem I am trying to solve, such as the handling of the global coordinates of the aerial tiles, but I am hoping that this code could provide a starting point for training a RefineNet enhanced building footprint semantic segmentation model.  If not, are you aware of any other sources of code that would be better suited to that task that you could share?","closed_by":{"login":"DrSleep","id":7841432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7841432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep","html_url":"https://github.com/DrSleep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
