Either way, I assume that is not how the model is supposed to work.\r\n\r\nDo I need at least two classes that are not ignored for the model to work?  Would the model work if I assigned a code of 0 for buildings and a code of 1 for everything else in the image?  If that does not work and I have to properly classify a lot of objects in my images that will significantly reduce the number of images I will be able to use with the model, since I only have buildings classified at this point.  I have 4000 images ready to go if I could just classify buildings and make everything else an ignored portion of the image or a single class, but I would only have 100 or less if I have to manually classify real objects in the images other than buildings.  Also if I had a dataset with codes of 0, 1, and 255 (ignore) would the number of classes parameter in the configuration file need to be set to 2 classes or 3 classes?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, does the model work properly with 32 bit images or does it require 24 bit images like the images in the nyu dataset?","closed_by":{"login":"DrSleep","id":7841432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7841432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep","html_url":"https://github.com/DrSleep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
