just means that there are 256 different colours available.\r\nthe NYUD colours only use the first 40 values; VOC -- 20 and etc.\r\n\r\nwhat happens is the network predicts indices from 0 to `num_classes`, then each predicted index is replaced by a corresponding RGB vector from the cmap file; say, your network predicted indices `[2, 3, 1]` and the colourmap is `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0,
