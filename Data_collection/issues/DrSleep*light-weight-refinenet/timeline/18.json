Now, for visualisation purposes, you would want to map these 1-D integers into 3-D RGB values. If you take a look at `cmap`, you would notice that it contains 3 values (R,G,B) per each row. When we apply `cmap[...]`, we map our class predictions to corresponding RGB colours.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/comments/454219064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DrSleep","id":7841432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7841432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep","html_url":"https://github.com/DrSleep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2129492673,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjEyOTQ5MjY3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet/issues/events/2129492673","actor":{"login":"DrSleep","id":7841432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7841432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep","html_url":"https://github.com/DrSleep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrSleep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-10T23:36:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
