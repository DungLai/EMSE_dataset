Considerations  \r\n## User-specified informations  \r\n- Service URL  \r\n- Layer name  \r\n- Bands information in WCS request (number, type, sensor, etc.)  \r\n\r\nAll those informations should be stored within the hdfs files and with the model, once the training is done. This will improve re-usability of the datasets and models. Moreover, we should store (or at least make sure to include an easy access to) the service's GetCapability result.  \r\n\r\n## Handling the bbox for the request  \r\nA bounding box must be provided with the request.  \r\n### Options:  \r\n1. Specified by the user from a csv-like file.  \r\n (+) Same approach for data preparation (images_to_samples.py) or inference (inference.py).  \r\n (-) Substantial effort required by the user.  \r\n \r\n2. AOIs are stored as polygons in the gpkg, differentiating trn/val/tst AOIs.  \r\n (+) Easy for the user to generate those polygons.  \r\n (+) Same approach for data preparation (images_to_samples.py) or inference (inference.py).  \r\n (++) AOIs can be stored and re-used once the model is trained. Giving context on the training process will greatly improve the model's re-usability.  \r\n \r\n3. AOIs are deducted from the reference (ground truth) data. Convex hull around polygons, differentiating trn/val/tst data.  \r\n (+) Not much preprocessing required by the user, for data preparation.  \r\n (++) AOIs can be stored and re-used once the model is trained. Giving context on the training process will greatly improve the model's re-usability.\r\n (-) Another approach must be designed for inference, since there are usually no reference data, at that stage.  \r\n\r\n## Python library for WCS request  \r\n### Options:\r\n1. [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request) is the generic python module for handling web requests. \r\n  (+) Massively used for handling http requests.\r\n  (-) Basic.\r\n\r\n2.

[PodPac](https://podpac.org/index.html) aims to facilitate access of data products and use of cloud computing architecture (AWS) for processing. \r\n  (+-) Project started in 2017, regular update since then.\r\n  (-) Does a lot more than what we aim to achieve here.

Of which:  \r\n\r\nFirst, WCS might not be the best solution for what we intend to do. WCS services are very vendor specific, I believe we're more looking for a \"raster data connector\", in order to directly access the stored raw data, not reprocess/interpolated data. To that end, we might end up with [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org) or [THREDDS](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/) services. As other options, we note [OGC API coverage] (https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc_api_coverages) which might get more attention from the public in a near future and [STAC](https://stacspec.org/), which is getting a lot of attention these days.  \r\n\r\nSecond, [OWSLib](http://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/) does not meet our requirements yet;  \r\n- We got issues regarding [http handling](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/issues/588)\r\n- We have to handle the version negotiation\r\n- Maxsize and other server limitations are not handled by the
