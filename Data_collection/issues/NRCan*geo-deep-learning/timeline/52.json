following was tested on Windows 10 using Anaconda.\r\n\r\nIn conda 4.5.12 python 3.7.2 and activating [Fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html) 1.8.4 and [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 1.0.13 are good alternative to direct use of OGR and GDAL as described in [image_to_samples.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/master/images_to_samples.py#L209) in the preceding comment.\r\n\r\nI tested a prototype using Fiona and Rasterio to read  a GeoPackage file containing 500 000 vector features and for each feature reading a portion of a GeoTIFF file using Rasterio and it works well.\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\nimport fiona\r\nschema = {'geometry': 'Point', 'properties': [('title', 'str')]}\r\ncrs = {'init': 'EPSG:4326'}\r\nwith fiona.open('foo.gpkg', 'w', layer='bar_foo', driver='GPKG',\r\nschema=schema, crs=crs) as d:\r\n    d.writerecords([{\r\n                    'geometry': {'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [0.0, 0.0]},\r\n                    'properties': {'title': 'One'}}])\r\n```\r\nI found one problem when creating the GPKG file with Fiona it exits with the following message\r\n```\r\nERROR 1: sqlite3_exec(CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE \"rtree_line_geom\" USING rtree(id, minx, maxx, miny, maxy)) failed: table \"rtree_line_geom\" already exists\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"fiona/_err.pyx\", line 201, in fiona._err.GDALErrCtxManager.__exit__\r\nfiona._err.CPLE_AppDefinedError: b'sqlite3_exec(CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE \"rtree_line_geom\" USING rtree(id, minx, maxx, miny, maxy)) failed: table \"rtree_line_geom\" already exists'\r\nException ignored in: 'fiona._shim.gdal_flush_cache'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"fiona/_err.pyx\", line 201, in fiona._err.GDALErrCtxManager.__exit__\r\nfiona._err.CPLE_AppDefinedError: b'sqlite3_exec(CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE \"rtree_line_geom\" USING rtree(id, minx, maxx, miny, maxy)) failed: table \"rtree_line_geom\" already exists'\r\n\r\nProcess finished with exit code 0\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt's not an error as the Process exit with code  0 and it said in the message Exception ignored.  The GPKG file seems to be created correctly.\r\n\r\nAs reported [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/fiona-feedstock/issues/53) by @sgillies \"This has nothing to do with fiona or the rtree python package. See section 2 of https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html.\"\r\n\r\nI was able to run this python program without the previous error in conda 4.5.12 in python 3.7.2 by importing manually the Fiona wheel [Fiona‑1.8.4‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and the GDAL wheel [GDAL‑2.3.3‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and addiing the path to the GDAL DLL\r\n```\r\nset PATH=%PATH%;<your local path>\\Lib\\site-packages\\osgeo\r\n```\r\nFinally, I noticed at least one difference in the .gpkh file produced.  In the environement wich produced the error, the spatial index of the layers are not created whereas they are created in the environment from the wheel distribution.\r\n\r\nSo two options are possible for solving this issue:\r\n- In anadonda installing Fiona and GDAL manually the wheel (pip install...) and it works without any Traceback\r\n- Make a request  to Anaconda project to modify SQLite product to compile the SQLite with the rtree activated.\r\n\r\nThe second avenue (request to Anaconda) should be the prefered choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/463397041/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dan-Eli","id":22153353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTUzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22153353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli","html_url":"https://github.com/Dan-Eli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2138096654,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzODA5NjY1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/2138096654","actor":{"login":"sgillies","id":33697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies","html_url":"https://github.com/sgillies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T22:13:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138096655,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzgwOTY2NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/2138096655","actor":{"login":"sgillies","id":33697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies","html_url":"https://github.com/sgillies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgillies/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T22:13:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Dan-Eli","id":22153353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTUzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22153353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli","html_url":"https://github.com/Dan-Eli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dan-Eli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T19:03:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T19:03:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/67","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/67/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/67/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/67/events","html_url":"http
