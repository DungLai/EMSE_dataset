Interesting excerpts from [HDF Product Designer](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/HPD/HDF+Product+Designer ++):\r\n\r\n>The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) provides a flexible container that supports **groups** and **datasets**, each of which can have attributes.  In many ways, HDF5 is similar to a directory structure in a file and, like directory structures, the same data can be structured and annotated in many ways. This flexibility empowers HDF5 users to arrange data in ways that make sense to them. However, it can make it difficult to share data ...\r\nMany communities have successfully addressed this problem by creating conventional structures and annotations for data in HDF5.  **This approach depends on data files (e.g., products) that carefully follow these conventions.**\r\nA HDF5 *product* is the content that should exist in a single HDF5 file. \r\nThis content is defined by the HDF5 objects (groups, attributes, datasets), their names, the hierarchies they create (links and references), and attribute values. Dataset values are typically not stored in such files (unless they qualify as metadata) thus this software cannot be used as a data server. Once completed, a HDF5 product is replicated in many files (commonly on the order of tens of thousands or more) and filled with real data.\r\n\r\nHow would the use of HDF5 help us in forming totally independent DL containers that would contain all the information needed for interoperability ?  Could we implement something in relation to \"standardised environments\" as per [OGC Testbed 14](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed14) ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/461920847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ymoisan","id":7468595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7468595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan","html_url":"https://github.com/ymoisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/461947901","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/51#issuecomment-461947901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/51","id":461947901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTk0NzkwMQ==","user":{"login":"ymoisan","id":7468595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7468595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan","html_url":"https://github.com/ymoisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T21:10:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T21:10:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How well does HDF5 play with Big Data infrastructures and OGC services like WCS ?
