operationalization approaches, inference.py will need to read and concatenate single band rasters rather than [multiband

This implies extending [sample_creation.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/sample_creation.py)'s use to inference.py and possibly merging with [images_to_samples.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/images_to_samples.py) (soon to become data_to_tiles.py --> #215 ). \r\n\r\nThis issue is closely related to #221 and #222. A future reading utility will have to manage a list of rasters as input with variable configration (some may be multiband, others will be single-band, maybe even for a same training dataset).

#381 \r\n\r\n****\r\n(notes added by @remtav)\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the use of \"solaris.tile\" and \"solaris.vector\" for tiling, in the \"tiling_per_aoi\" function. Just as a reminder, this function is used in the first for loop of the tiling script. This for loop simply cuts up the imagery and ground truth to \"patch_size\", keeping raster and vector formats and all information they contain (ex.: attributes of vector data). The new implementation is based on torchgeo. What it does:\r\n1. GeoDataset + GridGeoSampler to define bboxes\r\n2. Write vector patches with OGR\r\n3. Write raster patches with GDAL (with some extra parallelism)\r\n\r\nThe 2nd for loop in tiling script (the one that burns vector patch to raster, filters by minimum annotated percent and sorts between trn and val), remains untouched.\r\n\r\nOne major difference of this new implementation, compared to previous is explained [here](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/pull/386#issuecomment-1324299355). \r\n\r\nIn a further PR, solaris will be entirely removed from tiling script. It is currently still [used in the burning process](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/pull/386/files#diff-dfd9bbcd916825817724544d679592e4866aae2744ed2c868e00d0a782f354e5R431). It's also present in the calculation of vector-based metrics, currently in use [for evaluating extraction of building footprints](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/222-stac-item-input/utils/metrics.py#L202).\r\n\r\nLet's congratulate @ms888ekb for his first contribution to geo-deep-learning in the form of an impeccable, rigorous and very useful PR!!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
