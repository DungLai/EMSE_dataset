you properly set all the random seed at the appropriate places in the code, a training procedure can be repeated exactly on the same machine, but there is no guarantee on another machine. In my opinion, the main issue is more with having a piece of code that actually works for an old experiment. As the system evolves (change version) it is possible that old experiments will become broken with the new code, so keeping a link (tag, github hash, etc.) of the version is good practice. If it's an experiment that uses work-in-progress code, it's still a good idea to at least push it in a development branch and we can then link it with its commit hash value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/758827311/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bstdenis","id":16806488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA2NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16806488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis","html_url":"https://github.com/bstdenis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstdenis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/758908551","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/177#issuecomment-758908551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/177","id":758908551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODkwODU1MQ==","user":{"login":"ymoisan","id":7468595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7468595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan","html_url":"https://github.com/ymoisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-12T20:09:40Z","updated_at":"2021-01-12T20:09:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Folks, this should be taken care of in the metadata of the model, to be stored eventually in a STAC extension.
