#362 \r\n\r\nA new method in the AOI class defines a \"raster_name\" attribute, used mainly for printing during execution, but also as output name of multiband raster if [\"write_multiband == True\"](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/dataset/aoi.py#L154). \r\n\r\nFor the \"raster_name\" attribute, I decided to suffix the name with bands requested as suggested by @ms888ekb \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\ninput:\"tests/data/spacenet/SpaceNet_AOI_2_Las_Vegas-056155973080_01_P001-WV03-${dataset.bands}.tif\" \r\nbands requested: [\"R\", \"G\", \"B\"]\r\n\"raster_name\" output: \"tests/data/spacenet/SpaceNet_AOI_2_Las_Vegas-056155973080_01_P001-WV03-RGB_**R-G-B**.tif\"\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice that when more than 4 bands are requested, the suffix \"raster_name\" will become the actual number of bands, not the names of bands juxtaposed as a string. For example:\r\ninput:\"tests/data/spacenet/SpaceNet_AOI_2_Las_Vegas-056155973080_01_P001-WV03-RGB.tif\" \r\nbands requested: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\r\n\"raster_name\" output: \"tests/data/spacenet/SpaceNet_AOI_2_Las_Vegas-056155973080_01_P001-WV03-RGB_**7bands**.tif\"\r\n\r\nSee more examples here: https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/pull/364/files#r1000666932\r\n\r\n@valhassan is that all right with
