prep changes:\r\n- clip raster to gpkg when gpkg's extent is smaller than raster. Requires geopandas (can we find a work around without geopandas?)\r\n- always pad sat images with nan values when possible, then convert those values to 0 during training\r\n- always pad map images (labels) with ignore_index value to keep any new \"background\" values (eg if padding with 0 value) from being created, as was done previously\r\n\r\nAugmentations:\r\n- Add RadiometricTrim with random trim value inside an inputted range\r\n- Add RandomCrop with an inputted target_size. Goal: decrease amount of duplicaton at sample prep step and maximise effect of seing same sample with small offset (previously done with large overlap at sample prep step)\r\n\r\nFixes #68, #131, #127, #115","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/673656625","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/131#issuecomment-673656625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/131","id":673656625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzY1NjYyNQ==","user":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-13T19:04:43Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T19:04:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Resolved with PR #133 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/673656625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3653468727,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY1MzQ2ODcyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/3653468727","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-13T19:04:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
