Take a look at augmentation.py script (GDL latest commits/version) there is a scaling function there which uses a scale parameter set from a config file; it may be worthwhile to comment the function out.\r\n\r\nAlso, just to eliminate problems with data type you could debug by scaling back to uint8 (x 255) before your start the GDL pipeline; test to see if the val loss is still exploding.

After taking a closer look at the code I noticed I divided the image pixels by 10000 before saving the image. I multiplied that back and looked at the range of the pixel values (for 50 images) which are between 146 and 8379 with some values having a fractional part of 0.5. So as integers the pixel values are between 292 and 16758, thus uint15 (x 32767). Do you have a good way for dealing with this range? Treat it as unit16 (despite the values almost fitting into unit14)?\r\n\r\nFYI these are sentinnel 2 images (\"COPERNICUS/S2\") downloaded from the Google Earth Engine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/937387844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krishanr","id":16637530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjM3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16637530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr","html_url":"https://github.com/krishanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/937751055","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/209#issuecomment-937751055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/209","id":937751055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCNASdM435PIP","user":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T12:37:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T12:37:51Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi Krishan,\r\nIt is possible that the range of values in your images are way smaller than the range of possible values in which they are encoded.
