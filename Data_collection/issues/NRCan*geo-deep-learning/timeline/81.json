Does architecture like deeplabv3 support adaptation on the fly?\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, torchvision segmentation models, including deeplabv3 (with resnet backbone), are hardcoded to receive a 3 channel input. We would have to suggest modifications to the code in torchvision and implement models on our side meanwhile. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, some models found on github have a `n_channels` parameter as input, e.g. this implementation of [Deeplav3 with resnet](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception/blob/c8ff02c6eeb2b774ad5a25557a60ee48e04635c6/doc/deeplab_resnet.py#L148) or this [UNet: semantic segmentation with PyTorch](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/tree/master/unet/unet_model.py#L9).
