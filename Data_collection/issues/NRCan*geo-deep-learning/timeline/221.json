this issue, I think CSVs could still be useful as an input to GDL's tiling / inference since [it's a format everyone and their grandmother know and GDL isn't using it to store data, just to reference it](https://towardsdatascience.com/stop-using-csvs-for-storage-here-are-the-top-5-alternatives-e3a7c9018de0). What I'd suggest for the future of GDL, is expect a minimal csv with three columns for training and one column for inference:\r\n\r\n## minimal training's csv columns\r\n| imagery path | vector ground truth path  | dataset |\r\n| ----------- | --- | --------------- |\r\n| my_dir/my_geoimagery1.tif | my_dir/my_geogt1.gpkg | trn |\r\n| my_dir/my_geoimagery2.tif | my_dir/my_geogt2.gpkg | tst |\r\n| ... | ... | ... |\r\n\r\n## minimal inference csv columns\r\n| imagery path |\r\n| ----------- | \r\n| my_dir/my_newgeoimagery1.tif |\r\n| my_dir/my_newgeoimagery2.tif |\r\n| ... |\r\n\r\nTherefore, for training, [we'd remove the 2nd column \"meta\"](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/utils/utils.py#L415), used to reference metadata to include as training data. This relates to a feature that we removed in #227 . We could also discuss the relevance of keeping the 4th column \"attribute_name\" (aka attribute field). The natural (and currently implemented) place to define an attribute name and value to use to filter all ground truth data [is in the dataset config](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/config/dataset/test_ci_segmentation_binary.yaml#L16). However, if we still think a user might need to reference an attribute field and values on a per-file basis, the csv's 4th and 5th columns could be dedicated to optionally setting per-file attribute fields and values if they differ from one file to the other. If these columns are not empty, the dataset config would be overridden by these values and the tiling process would rely on the per-file values, not the dataset-wide ones.\r\n\r\nLast thing, for inference, if a ground truth file is specified in an optional 2nd column, then inference could automatically perform metric evaluation. In previous homemade tests, I also used an extra column to set a name for the aoi in each row. This helps make a more human readable report of evaluation/benchmark, for example. This should be discussed\r\n\r\nHere's a before/after outlook of our training / inference csv *with all optional columns*\r\n\r\n## Current input csv columns\r\n| imagery path | metdata path | vector ground truth path  | attribute name | dataset |\r\n| ----------- | --- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\r\n| my_dir/my_geoimagery1.tif | my_metadata1.tif | my_dir/my_geogt1.gpkg
