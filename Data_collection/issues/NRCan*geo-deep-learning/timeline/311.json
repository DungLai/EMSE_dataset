the AOI object validates that the bounds of image and geopackage intersect, but doesn't check if they are 1:1. Actually, the bounds of a vector file is measured by the bounding box that contains all vector features. Therefore, there is never a 1:1 fit with the image unless features extend all the way to the limits of the image. The best alternative I can find to the current approach is to check how much overlap there is between the bounds of image and label and saving this info into a report for the user to check and perform manual validation if needed. I can implement this.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, our upcoming pipeline will generate gpkg files on the fly for a given image and a perfect fit will be ensured.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/1147421201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6786458926,"node_id":"CE_lADOCNASdM5KY289zwAAAAGUgSUu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/6786458926","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T14:23:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
