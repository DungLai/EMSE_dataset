Although Kornia has GPU capability, tests were all performed on CPU since only small images fit on a GPU's memory.\r\n- Sklearn expects single-band numpy arrays. The processing of a multiband array is therefore done with a for loop, processing one band at a time and concatenating results back into a multiband array.\r\n\r\nImages:\r\nsensor | image | height | width\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nAerial | NB_23322E759967N_clipped | 341 | 280\r\nWorldview-2 | MB13-052686355070_01_P002 | 8924 | 4344\r\nWorldview-2 | BC6P002-052652307020_01_P002 | 18424 |

You're right, in the script above, the default value for Kornia's clip_limit is used, which is a mistake. It should've used the \"clip_limit=enhance_clip_limit\". I'll edit. Also, as you've mentionned, clip_limit=0.1 for sklearn is pretty equal to clip_limit=20 with Kornia. I seem to get even closer results with 0.1 --> 25. This \"translation\" seems linear, i.e. 0.5 --> 125 gives identical results as well. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we should raise an error if 0 < clip_limit < 1, since the user may be mistaking sklearn's values with Kornia's expected values.\r\n\r\nThanks again @valhassan for this insight.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/1298861515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7715525274,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCNASdM5TdpskzwAAAAHL4ZKa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/7715525274","actor":{"login":"valhassan","id":24499815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDk5ODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24499815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan","html_url":"https://github.com/valhassan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T17:21:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7715525285,"node_id":"SE_lADOCNASdM5TdpskzwAAAAHL4ZKl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/7715525285","actor":{"login":"valhassan","id":24499815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDk5ODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24499815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan","html_url":"https://github.com/valhassan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valhassan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T17:21:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7932958374,"node_id":"CE_lADOCNASdM5TdpskzwAAAAHY11am","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/7932958374","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-01T15:19:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
