#422 should be tackled before this one.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn excel, when opening a csv as outputted by verify_segmentation.py, here's what happens:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774759/206494046-19a47bdd-e14f-4200-b9fd-1a3ab787ea31.png)\r\n\r\nComa's are automatically detected as delimiters, whereas the semi-colon is the delimiter.\r\n\r\nThe workaround was to open csv in a text editor, then copy/paste the content into excel, then convert this pasted text to columns by indicating the \";\" as delimiter. I'd be nice to be able to open the csv directly with excel.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- replace the comas in raster's metadata by \";\"\r\n- use coma as delimiter when saving csv.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested and works:\r\n\r\nBefore (notice how raster metadata is interpreted as columns):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774759/206496579-4295fc8a-eaf8-46c6-b458-7619d8cac80f.png)\r\n\r\nAfter (raster's metadata remains in a single
