Context\r\n\r\nClassification of lidar [point clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) is resource-intensive as it generally involves human interaction to obtain decent results.  Furthermore, it has been shown that classification results and accuracies vary between data producers.  Finally, classification amounts to about 30% of lidar data acquisition costs.  \r\n\r\nGiven that context, how can Deep Learning (DL) help in the classification process ?\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\nDL architectures used in imagery are mostly [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).  Convolution implies pixels.  However, lidar cloud points do **not** correspond to pixels and therefore CNNs are likely not applicable in this case.\r\n\r\n# Thoughts\r\n\r\nCould we use prior data (DEM, imagery, etc.) to initialize weights in a scene-specific rough manner rather than using a random initialization ?\r\n\r\nCould we use standard unsupervised clustering algorithms like [K-Means or DBSCAN](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) ?  If so, what is the minimum number of points we can run clustering algorithms against ?\r\n\r\n# References & projects\r\n\r\n[Classifying airborne LiDAR point clouds via deep features learned by a multi-scale convolutional neural network](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2018.1431840?src=recsys&journalCode=tgis20&)  Paywalled, unfortunately ...\r\n\r\n[Deep Semantic Classification for 3D LiDAR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08355).
