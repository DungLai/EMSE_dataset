deeplabv3: load coco state dict only if in training (not inference)\r\n- in utils.py/image_reader_as_array(), assume input image has values between 0 and 255. These values should not be computed from input. (19 nov 12:24)\r\n- copy .yaml to log files\r\n- extend use of pathlib (delete create_or_empty_folder function in utils.py)\r\n- move reader functions in utils.py to readers.py in utils folder\r\n- add verifications.py with functions to check validity of features in vector files (for example)\r\n- in images_to_samples.py, loop through images and gpkg in .csv to validate their existence. Then validate features in gpkg.\r\n- samples folder named with sample parameters. All models derived from particular samples are saved **within** this folder.\r\n- in images_to_samples.py, show number of samples prepared vs number of potential samples\r\n- in images_to_samples, if min_annotated_percent is 0, samples will be created (l.117). \"<=\" replaced \"<\".\r\n- correct bug with HPC and forcing device to cuda:0\r\n- in report_classification, ignore predictions with class \"ignore_index\"\r\n- Change parameter «sample/samp_dist» to «sample/overlap» to make uniform with inference.py. Also more intuitive. (issue #111 )\r\n- samples folder create with info about parameters used (sample_size, overlap, etc.)\r\n- manage trainings if no test data (issue #108 )\r\n- bug fix at inference: don't chop image on right and bottom\r\n- getkeydef() function: If key exists but no value is provided, set default value.\r\n- visualisation: à partir d'un dataloader, d'une batch (input/output) et d'un input/output individuel (donc n'importe où dans le code)\r\n\t- création des heatmaps\r\n\t- sur un subset d'échantillons\r\n- bug fix: num_classes + 1 for train and inference in semantic segmentation tasks. (issue #98 )\r\n- model is saved under samples folder, not data_path\r\n- add info about hdf5 path in SegmentationDataset (CreateDataset.py)\r\n- bug fix: per class metrics integrating ignore_index (après tests de félix)\r\n- assert no layers are being chopped in load_from_checkpoint during inference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/567495396","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/111#issuecomment-567495396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/111","id":567495396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzQ5NTM5Ng==","user":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T13:44:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T13:44:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fixed in #112 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/567495396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2897269310,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg5NzI2OTMxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/2897269310","actor":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-19T13:44:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
