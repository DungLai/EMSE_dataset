A relational-db-like structure  using csv or text files ([WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), [DeepSat SAT6](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat6/home), [Overhead Imagery Research Data Set,](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oirds/) [OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html))\r\n2.  A file system tree ([ImageNet](http://image-net.org/index), [Caltech 101](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/))\r\n3.  A custom file format ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/))\r\n4.  Pre-made datasets ([CIFAR10 and CIFAR100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html))\r\n\r\nIn pytorch, there is a useful generic dataset class called [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder).  The data must be stored in a file system tree structure like ImageNet. I suggest that we take advantage of this for our classification feature. We would be able to skip the create_samples.py step when doing classification if we use this class.\r\n\r\nFor our net, we could use an existing net model from Torchvision such as a ResNet or inception3 which both are good for classification. I will be looking in to what needs to be changed in our existing code to add a classification feature using these methods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/440691320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"epeterson12","id":43219583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjE5NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43219583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12","html_url":"https://github.com/epeterson12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"epeterson12","id":43219583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjE5NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43219583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12","html_url":"https://github.com/epeterson12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-13T13:16:11Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T13:16:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/30","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/30/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/30/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/30/events","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/pull/30","id":390674019,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM4Mzg1ODU1","number":30,"title":"Added
