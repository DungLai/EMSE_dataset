Description\r\n\r\n(Ideally, we'd solve issue #408 before this issue to remove duplicate references to test data)\r\n\r\nFor example, if a test is located under `tests/utils/`, the default working directory becomes this directory, making the test data under `tests/data` and `tests/tiling` unreachable:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774759/206232408-0a9732b3-24ae-4c9e-9f7d-c0763eb61957.png)\r\n\r\nThis results in a FileNotFoundError when executing tests:\r\n```\r\nE                   FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'tests/data/massachusetts_buildings_kaggle.zip'\r\n\r\n..\\..\\..\\..\\Miniconda3\\envs\\geo_deep_env\\lib\\zipfile.py:1249: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, for each test, the configuration must be changed manually to point to correct directory (`path/to/geo-deep-learning`), which is obviously time-consuming.\r\n\r\n## EDIT: solaris' solution (cleaner)\r\n\r\nUnder `tests/data/__init__.py`, define the file's directory as `data_dir`:\r\nhttps://github.com/CosmiQ/solaris/blob/5315390942e05e919555088361bd3df42d4f5a18/solaris/data/__init__.py#L10\r\n\r\nThen use this variable to get test data, no matter where the test script is located (under `tests/data`)\r\nhttps://github.com/CosmiQ/solaris/blob/5315390942e05e919555088361bd3df42d4f5a18/tests/test_utils/test_data.py#L12\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other solution\r\n\r\nThis small function could solve this issue:\r\n```python\r\ndef set_test_wd():\r\n    test_dir = Path('tests/')\r\n    if not test_dir.is_dir():\r\n        cwd = Path(os.getcwd())\r\n        new_wdir = cwd\r\n        for index in range(len(cwd.parts)):\r\n            if (new_wdir / test_dir).is_dir():\r\n                break\r\n            new_wdir = new_wdir.parent\r\n            if index == len(cwd.parts) - 1:\r\n                raise NotADirectoryError(f\"Couldn't locate test directory\")\r\n        os.chdir(new_wdir)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, our tests could use this function right before places where relative paths to test data are set:\r\n```python\r\n# tests/foo/foo.py\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    set_test_dir()\r\n    extract_archive(src=\"tests/data/spacenet.zip\")\r\n    data = read_csv(\"tests/tiling/tiling_segmentation_binary-singleband_ci.csv\")\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
