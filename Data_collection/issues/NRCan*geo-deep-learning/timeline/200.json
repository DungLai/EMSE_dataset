It does seem like a much simpler implementation. With the current implementation, we had determined that the trim needed to apply to the histogram of the entire original image (before tiling), not just the tile that is being sent to training by dataloader. This required to \r\n1. generate the histogram (e.g. with np.bincount) during tiling\r\n2. store the histogram in the tile's metadata (currently in hdf5)\r\n3. read this histogram during training to trim according to original histogram.\r\n\r\nThis was more complex to implement and required passing more information from tiling to training. For the sake of simplicity, I prefer using this augmentation directly on the tiles' histogram. However, the risk is with very dark or bright tiles (i.e. with low contrast). These tiles would always get their histogram chopped more aggressively than tiles with high contrast.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/1026023340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/comments/1282972300","html_url":"https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/200#issuecomment-1282972300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/200","id":1282972300,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCNASdM5MeJqM","user":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-18T20:34:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T20:35:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Last tests by @valhassan show that the CLAHE enhancement algorithm may be a good solution compared to using the radiometric trim.
