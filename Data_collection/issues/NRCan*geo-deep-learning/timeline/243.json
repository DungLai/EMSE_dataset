PR makes no major changes to functionality and is mostly aimed at cleaning out some lenghty pieces of code in preparation for #222 #223. Result: net loss of over 200 lines of code :)\r\n\r\ncloses #265 \r\n\r\n- utils.py: add to_path and validate_path_exists in get_key_def() and use\r\n- logger.py: create set_tracker() function and use\r\n- utils.py: create set_device() function and use (also checks if model can be pushed to device)\r\n- remove unused ruamel_yaml dependency and yaml reader function (irrelevant with hydra)\r\n> read_parameters() function and ruamel_yaml have been temporarily added to old scripts like data_analysis (#138 ) and gdl_hyperopt_template (#243 ) but ruamel_yaml is removed from environment.yaml since current scripts no longer rely on it.\r\n\r\n- inference_segmentation.py: no parameters from training cfg inside script (use hydra)\r\n- augmentations: complete usage of hydra for dontcare value (remove dontcare2background)\r\n- utils.py and more: clean out other unused functions, imports and
