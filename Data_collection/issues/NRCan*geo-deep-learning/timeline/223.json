issue is becoming a priority to address as the temporary [sample_creation.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/sample_creation.py) for tiling single-band imagery is getting more and more outdated.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'd suggest to make a uniform tiling pipeline for both single-band ([stac item](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/222) or not) and multi-band imagery. In the [proposed input csv ](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/221#issuecomment-1121310523), the imagery path could be in one of three formats:\r\n1. path to a multi-band image file:\r\n`my_dir/my_multiband_geofile.tif`\r\n\r\n2. path to a single-band image file, where the band specific string in the file name would be in a hydra-like [interpolation format](https://hydra.cc/docs/1.0/advanced/override_grammar/basic/#primitives). The interpolation string would refer to a dataset parameter with a list of desired band names or strings to help resolve the single-band filenames. For example:\r\nin dataset config:\r\n`dataset.bands: [R, G, B]`\r\nin input csv:\r\n`my_dir/my_singleband_geofile_band_${dataset.bands}.tif`\r\nThe tiling script would therefore combine, in the same order as bands appear in dataset config, the following files:\r\n`my_dir/my_singleband_geofile_band_R.tif`\r\n`my_dir/my_singleband_geofile_band_G.tif`\r\n`my_dir/my_singleband_geofile_band_B.tif`\r\n\r\nWe'd then use torchgeo's machinery [to merge these singleband files](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/9f96cdd47293f1de7fc4486c60c632f9b895198e/torchgeo/datasets/geo.py#L434) as is done [in the 222-stac-item-input branch](https://github.com/remtav/geo-deep-learning/blob/222-stac-item-input/inference/InferenceDataset.py#L186).\r\n\r\n3.  a stac item referring to singleband assets. Bands would be selected by [common name in dataset config](https://github.com/remtav/geo-deep-learning/blob/222-stac-item-input/config/dataset/ccmeo_datacube_dataset.yaml#L13):\r\n`https://datacube-stage.services.geo.ca/api/collections/spacenet-samples/items/SpaceNet_AOI_2_Las_Vegas-056155973080_01_P001-WV03`\r\n\r\nFYI, issues would most probably be tackled in the following order: #221 , #222, #223, #215, #300 \r\nThis would also close the following issues: #139, #167
