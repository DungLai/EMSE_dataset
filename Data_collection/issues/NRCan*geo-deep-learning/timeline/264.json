PR makes no major changes to functionality and is mostly aimed at cleaning out some lenghty pieces of code in preparation for #222 #223. Result: net loss of over 200 lines of code :)\r\n\r\ncloses #265 \r\n\r\n- utils.py: add to_path and validate_path_exists in get_key_def() and use\r\n- logger.py: create set_tracker() function and use\r\n- utils.py: create set_device() function and use (also checks if model can be pushed to device)\r\n- remove unused ruamel_yaml dependency and yaml reader function (irrelevant with hydra)\r\n> read_parameters() function and ruamel_yaml have been temporarily added to old scripts like data_analysis (#138 ) and gdl_hyperopt_template (#243 ) but ruamel_yaml is removed from environment.yaml since current scripts no longer rely on it.\r\n\r\n- inference_segmentation.py: no parameters from training cfg inside script (use hydra)\r\n- augmentations: complete usage of hydra for dontcare value (remove dontcare2background)\r\n- utils.py and more: clean out other unused functions, imports and parameters","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6035047715,"node_id":"CE_lADOCNASdM5C-LemzwAAAAFnt4Uj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/6035047715","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-09T15:02:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6035047820,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCNASdM5C-LemzwAAAAFnt4WM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/events/6035047820","actor":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-09T15:02:32Z","project_card":{"id":77307590,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/77307590","project_id":13915781,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/13915781","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"To do"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
