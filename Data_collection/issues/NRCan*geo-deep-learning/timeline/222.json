operationalization approaches, inference.py will need to read and concatenate single band rasters rather than [multiband

This implies extending [sample_creation.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/sample_creation.py)'s use to inference.py and possibly merging with [images_to_samples.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/images_to_samples.py) (soon to become data_to_tiles.py --> #215 ). \r\n\r\nThis issue is closely related to #221 and #222. A future reading utility will have to manage a list of rasters as input with variable configration (some may be multiband, others will be single-band, maybe even for a same training dataset).

Result: net loss of over 200 lines of code :)\r\n\r\ncloses #265 \r\n\r\n- utils.py: add to_path and validate_path_exists in get_key_def() and use\r\n- logger.py: create set_tracker() function and use\r\n- utils.py: create set_device() function and use (also checks if model can be pushed to device)\r\n- remove unused ruamel_yaml dependency and yaml reader function (irrelevant with hydra)\r\n> read_parameters() function and ruamel_yaml have been temporarily added to old scripts like data_analysis (#138 ) and gdl_hyperopt_template (#243 ) but ruamel_yaml is removed from environment.yaml since current scripts no longer rely on it.\r\n\r\n- inference_segmentation.py: no parameters from training cfg inside script (use hydra)\r\n- augmentations: complete usage of hydra for dontcare value
