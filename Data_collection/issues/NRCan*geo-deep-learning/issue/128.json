For example:\r\n[config.yaml, data_analysis section](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/8f9b5aeb284f80536e5bdcae73adebf7aec9427b/conf/config.yaml#L31)\r\n[colormap.csv](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/master/data/colormap.csv)\r\n\r\nIn colormap.csv, the first column refers to input grayscale values corresponding to each class. This refers directly to the values chosen in the initial gpkg linked to each satellite image. Is the user always aware of the attribute value that correponds to each class (ex.: 1 for vegetation, 2 for hydro, etc.) ? If not, we could try to find a more transparent way of doing this mapping. If so, then we should still centralize this mapping in one place, like the config yaml (ie. not a separate file like colormap.csv). \r\n\r\nThis kind of mapping could become more and more important, especially if we develop, for example, class-specific metrics. \r\n\r\nHopefully, it's something STAC items will address. If not, I would like to suggest this dev as a priority. The first step would be to merge the colormap.csv file to the yaml, and map, in a single yaml section, the values associated to classes (which could then be used by a module like data_analysis) Just an idea.","closed_by":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
