annotation's mask. It was used when the extent of the input image was bigger than annotation's extent.   \nSince [Pytorch 0.4.1](https://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.1/nn.html#torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy), loss functions support `ignore_index`. When specified, the value in `ignore_value` isn't computed during loss calculation. This should be used instead of the current behavior. Moreover, `ignore_index` should be include in the config file, as a training hyperparameter.","closed_by":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/85/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/85/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
