An easy implementation would be to expect indexes instead of band names for the `dataset.bands` parameter. Rasterio can use this parameter directly to choose relevant bands. The user would be reponsible of knowing the band corresponding to each index. We'd add this information in our documentation.\r\n\r\nThis means we'd remove the limited [`BGR_to_RGB()`](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/utils/utils.py#L294) function. Also the band selection and ordering would happen in the AOI object construction, not as a transform [as with `BGR_to_RGB()`](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/utils/augmentation.py#L363).","closed_by":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/312/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
