As of today, the application has the capacity to perform semantic segmentation of images. In order to provide a larger capacity for RS tools, there is (at least) one task we need to add to the system : classification.\r\n\r\nThe definition of both these tasks and the difference between the two can be found in the [lexicon](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/cccot-shbk/AP/wikis/documentation/lexicon).","closed_by":{"login":"epeterson12","id":43219583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjE5NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43219583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12","html_url":"https://github.com/epeterson12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epeterson12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
