The user could then assess the overlap % percentage between imagery and ground truth and proceed to necessary verification. Geo-deep-learning wouldn't be automating this \"clipping\" anymore, mostly because the ground truth's bound (i.e. entire bounds for which the gt's data has been acquired) cannot be precisely measured. It can only be derived from bounds of all features, which is often smaller than actual bounds.","closed_by":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
