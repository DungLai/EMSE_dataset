To solve this problem ... developers can share models among different frameworks with ONNX, such as by exporting models built in PyTorch and importing them to Caffe2.\r\n\r\nPyTorch has continued to add features to support both research and production usage, including the ability to bridge these two worlds via TorchScript ... With PyTorch 1.2, the open source ML framework takes a major step forward for production usage with the addition of an improved and more polished TorchScript environment. These improvements make it even easier to ship production models, expand support for exporting ONNX formatted models ...
