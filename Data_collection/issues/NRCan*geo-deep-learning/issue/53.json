For it to be coherent, the module should be named `inference.py`;  \r\n- Every reference to the task of per pixel classification (from a remote sensing vocabulary) should be referenced as semantic segmentation;\r\n- In input of the module, one should be able to pass a list of images. The current behavior is to load all images in a folder;\r\n- The path to write all classified images should also be passed as parameter. The current behavior is to write classified images in the same folder as the one in input.
