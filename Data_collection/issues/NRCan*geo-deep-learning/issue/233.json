Therefore, it will be easier to add the relevant solaris utilities to GDL directly, make PRs to ensure a seamless transition, then remove those utilities from GDL's repo.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
