As a result of the convolution with a high overlap (low stride) and smoothing on original image, it seems the smoothing may overestimate class probabilities at upper-right corner as is shown by this heatmap on which a water extraction never \"activates\" (i.e. predicts with constant probability the absence of waterbody). This should be tested thoroughly and independently of the action of any model (i.e. with a numpy array filled with close-to-zero values).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774759/160870096-091e5358-57d5-4eb2-aba9-6f8c28e1f67f.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
