Furthermore, it has been shown that classification results and accuracies vary between data producers.  Finally, classification amounts to about 30% of lidar data acquisition costs.  \r\n\r\nGiven that context, how can Deep Learning (DL) help in the classification process ?\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\nDL architectures used in imagery are mostly [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).  Convolution implies pixels.  However, lidar cloud points do **not** correspond to pixels and therefore CNNs are likely not applicable in this case.\r\n\r\n# Thoughts\r\n\r\nCould we use prior data (DEM, imagery, etc.) to initialize weights in a scene-specific rough manner rather than using a random initialization ?\r\n\r\nCould we use standard unsupervised clustering algorithms like [K-Means or DBSCAN](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) ?  If so, what is the minimum number of points we can run clustering algorithms against ?\r\n\r\n# References & projects\r\n\r\n[Classifying airborne LiDAR point clouds via deep features learned by a multi-scale convolutional neural network](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2018.1431840?src=recsys&journalCode=tgis20&)  Paywalled, unfortunately ...\r\n\r\n[Deep Semantic Classification for 3D LiDAR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08355).
