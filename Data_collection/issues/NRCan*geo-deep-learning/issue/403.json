The naming convention for parameters changed in recent updates of GDL. This needs to be updated. Take for example this line of code: https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/0578afbd27b369313f9221637dc68169485baaab/inference_segmentation.py#L288 This param does not exist in our config files.\r\n2. The intent of this function override_model_params_from_checkpoint is to override parameters; however these parameters are being updated thereby causing the unexpected in expected values. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/0578afbd27b369313f9221637dc68169485baaab/inference_segmentation.py#L301-L305\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that this function should be deprecated in the future, we would like to maintain consistency of parameters i.e. parameters used to train the model == parameters used to infer on the model. Minor flexibility can exist in the modification of inputs.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
