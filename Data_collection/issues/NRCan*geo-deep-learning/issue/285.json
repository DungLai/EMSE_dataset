provides sensible defaults to output filenames of the inference process e.g. in the form of appending `_inference` to the input filename.  This is reasonable when running the inference process on local resources but not in the more general case of a remote runtime environment.  This ticket is about providing all runtime information items necessary for a remote inference to communicate with external systems where we might want to persist process artifacts, like logs.  \r\n\r\nTasks include:\r\n- [ ] querying for pending inference tasks to be run in remote system \r\n- [ ] updating production status of tasks\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\n- [ ] define runtime parameters stored in a YAML configuration file, mainly full path names for a variety of inference outputs including:\r\n  - [ ] [loggers and handlers in YAML](https://realpython.com/python-logging); send logs to GeoSys (and email ?)\r\n  - [ ] raw (raster) inference, vectorized results, generalized results\r\n\r\nIn a later version, those scripts should be decoupled from geo-deep-learning.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
