DL architectures are very dynamic and one can assume that the more we support, the more config parameters we will have to handle. Therefore, we could benefit from a dynamic import function, capable of directly instantiating a class, given it's fully qualified name. An example of such implementation is provided [here](https://github.com/plstcharles/thelper/blob/master/thelper/utils.py#L564).  \nModel could then be automatically constructed, given the parameter's dictionnary in the config file. Global parameters such as `num_classes` could be detected and [inspected](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html).
