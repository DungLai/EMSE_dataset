Along the lines of #51, we should modify the weights filename  so that it contains metadata of the particular training it is the result of: project, data type (RGB, lidar), date, epoch number, etc.\r\n\r\nAdding `epoch number` in the name would be indicative of when the best set of weights were obtained.  However, we may want to append `_outof_Y` where Y = the total number of epochs to whatever the best checkpoint is when training is done.  In that case, `..._27.pth` would mean the best epoch currently is 27 but the training process is not complete.  The final name would, be  `..._27_outof_50.pth` , for example.","closed_by":{"login":"ymoisan","id":7468595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7468595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan","html_url":"https://github.com/ymoisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
