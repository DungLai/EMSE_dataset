Such highly iterative algorithms require low-latency, high-throughput connections to the training data. But in the Federated Learning setting, the data is distributed across millions of devices in a highly uneven fashion. In addition, these devices have significantly higher-latency, lower-throughput connections and are only intermittently available for training.\" \r\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html\r\n\r\nCould this be applied in a later stage, e.g. to optimize our model through time ?","closed_by":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
