GDL could replace its in-house augmentations from [augmentation.py](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/utils/augmentation.py) for Kornia's ones. Initially, the problem was that torchvision's transforms were based on PIL and did not accept more than 3 bands. That is not the case with Kornia as it is much more flexible and offers lots of features (GPU-support, apply transforms on entire batch, etc.) that our in-house augmentations don't offer.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
