One relevant information in this report is the information concerning overlap between ground truth and imagery.\r\n\r\nThe [IoU metrics](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/dataset/aoi.py#L265) between ground truth and imagery cannot convey the relevant information about how ground truth overlaps imagery. We should separate this into 2 metrics:\r\n1. % overlap of ground truth realtive to imagery's extent (ie intersection over imagery's extent) \r\n2. % of ground truth's extent that is inside imagery's extent. \r\n\r\nThe first metric is interesting to better understand the data we're working with, but a % below 100% is not necessarily problematic (ex.: annotations may have covered the imagery only partially)\r\n\r\nIf this second metric's value is lower than 100%, then we have a serious issue with this particular AOI as some label data is located outside imagery. An error should be raised and user should investigate.
