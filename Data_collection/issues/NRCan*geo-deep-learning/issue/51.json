That list of inputs is stored [in csv files](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/0f63e25f2e4ed67e2b5f9038462403b2cf97ca63/README.md#csv-preparation).  For the results we store just the weights of our model (.pth file).  \r\n\r\nTo make our models interoperable, we need to write out the *model* together with related weights; those items are our final shareable outputs.  Also, should we care to implement checks on whether a particular dataset is amenable to inference using a given model, we need to store all *inputs* somewhere.  \r\n\r\nInitially we thought of using [HDF](http://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/) to store both the inputs to and outputs of our models.  It now appears one of the [STAC extensions](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions) might be a more logical approach, as STAC is much more web-friendly than HDF.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
