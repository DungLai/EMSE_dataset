There are two issues I encountered, one of which I was able to bypass:\r\n\r\n1. The image data are float32 type between 0 and 1.\r\n   So I had to remove the lines:\r\n```\r\nassert np_array.dtype in ['uint8', 'uint16'], f\"Invalid datatype {np_array.dtype}. \" \\\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  f\"Only uint8 and uint16 are supported in current version\"\r\n```\r\nfrom utils/readers.py, and lines 443-445 in utils/utils.py, to deal with float data.\r\n2. I'm able to get images_to_samples.py to work, but train_segmentation.py doesn't work, largely because the val_loss is over e^20 on every epoch (so the models never get saved).\r\n\r\nA side note is that I was able to train a model using code from around January 2020.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","closed_by":{"login":"krishanr","id":16637530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjM3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16637530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr","html_url":"https://github.com/krishanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishanr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
