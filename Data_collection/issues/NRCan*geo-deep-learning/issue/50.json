Since GeoTIFF is the data format used for training/inference, using a WCS would free users from having to store GeoTIFF files on their hardware.  This is turn has the benefit of easier integration to a Big Data environment that would expose its raster data sets as WCS.  We ought to make the code use GeoTIFF files generated on the fly through WCS web requests just as easy as using local GeoTIFF files.","closed_by":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
