4band hdf5 samples of the best deep learning model known to CCCOT: Cayouche.\n\nA few differences with previous Cayouche data:\n- pansharped with orfeo toolbox using Bayes algo\n- no tiling before sample creation\n- 16k x 16k samples will be prepared. With dynamic random cropping during training, small samples (512x512) no longer need to be created.\n\nConsiderations:\n- If data from gpkg extends past the coverage of sat images, gdl code should be adapted (or other solution must be discussed)\n- Bands should always be in R-G-B-NIR order. In the past, some images (if not all) have come B-G-R-NIR.
