We could also set alarms (and highlight in graph ?) when the loss function starts increasing and potentially stop the process.\r\n\r\nWe currently dump sklearn's [classification report](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) in log files.  We could try to plug that output in something like this : [python-live-graph-update-from-a-changing-text-file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33457040/python-live-graph-update-from-a-changing-text-file)\r\n\r\n\r\nLonger term goal : implement structured logging.  That would allow us to analyze several log files (e.g. training a dataset with different parameters over time) in log munging software.  \r\n\r\nInteresting item : [Eliot](https://github.com/ScatterHQ/eliot), the **causal** logging library. \"Most logging systems tell you *what* happened in your application, whereas eliot also tells you *why* it happened.\"","closed_by":{"login":"ymoisan","id":7468595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7468595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan","html_url":"https://github.com/ymoisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymoisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
