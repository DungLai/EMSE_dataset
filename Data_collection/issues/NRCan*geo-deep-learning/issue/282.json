For example,\r\n[pad](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L171) and [dist_samples](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L173) are duplicate variables. Also, the padding value is currently hardcoded.\r\n\r\nIt inference transforms, sample passed to model are [padded by 'chunk_size' all around original sample with mode=reflect](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L53) (mode reflect is used to improve segmentation at the border of samples). This should be softcoded and documented.\r\n\r\nAlso, [_pad_diff](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L38) and [_pad](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L51) should be used as transforms [rather than directly in gen_img_samples()](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/develop/inference_segmentation.py#L131) who's role is to sample the image, not preprocess/augment/pad it. An example of padding as transforms at test time can be found in[ torchgeo](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/744078fcff7e48957ffa5d0cd6b8acf3f5767b0a/torchgeo/datamodules/chesapeake.py#L256).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
