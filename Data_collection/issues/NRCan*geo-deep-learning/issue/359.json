Latest tests by @valhassan show that a light enhancement with the CLAHE algorithm applied on the entire image helps improve extraction for waterbodies and forests.\r\n\r\nAlthough ideally enhancement would be applied dynamically during training or inference, neither [Kornia's](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/enhance.html#kornia.enhance.equalize_clahe) nor [Scikitlearn's](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.exposure.html#equalize-adapthist) CLAHE enhancement support feeding a histogram of full image to determine the enhancement applied to a single patch. If enhancement is applied only patch by patch (which would be the easiest solution), results actually degrade compared to no enhancement at all.\r\n\r\nSuggested implementation: \r\n- for training: use Kornia's CLAHE, applied to entire image, save copy of enhanced image to disk, then use this copy for tiling. \r\n- for inference: IDEM, but enhanced copy is read window by window.","closed_by":{"login":"remtav","id":34774759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Nzc0NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34774759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav","html_url":"https://github.com/remtav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remtav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
