There are some limitations to this approach:  \r\n- Max pooling layers can be replaced with strides in conv layers, therefore augmenting the model's receptive field.  \r\n- Max pooling of size > 2x2 are not currently handled.  \r\n\r\nDepending of the architecture, calculating the receptive field of a model can be tricky/impossible. Therefore, it would be best to remove the function to calculate the [receptive field](https://github.com/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/blob/master/models/model_choice.py#L10) and simply replace it with:\r\na) a constant value, parametrizable from the config file; OR\r\nb) a constant value deduced from the size of the input patch (e.g. 10% in height/width) \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mpelchat04","id":38693210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjkzMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38693210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04","html_url":"https://github.com/mpelchat04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpelchat04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
