Initially in feb of this year, we made a push to work on it because we thought we would be using it's tiling features more and factoring out our evaluation code back to the library. However, other libraries like Torchgeo now exist that will in the future support remote reading of datasets and already support sampling tiles (I'm sure you're aware since you've been active on that repo). And there's torchmetrics, which is a more maintainable library where evaluation metrics should live and I think  we will be building on top of that moving forward instead of solaris. We just wrapped up a team week where discussed what tooling we want to focus on standardizing our practice on, and solaris was not on the list.\r\n> \r\n> There is no concrete plan for the 0.5.0 release given it is not a strategic prioirity for our company and pod, but more of an attempt to give back and make the library more minimal and fix installation issues with version 4. But I'll take a look at it this week. I'm still catching up on project work given I was traveling abroad last week, so please be patient.\r\n> \r\n> Given the above, I'd still like to wrap up the outstanding PRs and make it clearer what level of maintenance to expect for solaris. Devseed as a company will likely not be maintaining it in our organization, and it will probably be a personal, low priority maintenance project for me (since I don't intend to base any future projects on solaris and would prefer to write the minimal functionality I would use from scratch). Version 0.5.0 will not have a published conda package and will only be on pypi.\r\n> \r\n> If you have interest in being added as a maintainer to have more control over the direction of the library, I'm happy to connect you with Adam Van Etten, who I initially reached out to last year.\r\n> \r\n> Cheers,\r\n> Ryan\r\n\r\nGDL will therefore remove entirely it's use of Solaris within the coming weeks and replace with other libraries (ex.: torchgeo) or inhouse functions.","closed_by":{"login":"ms888ekb","id":54916039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTE2MDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54916039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb","html_url":"https://github.com/ms888ekb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ms888ekb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NRCan/geo-deep-learning/issues/381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
