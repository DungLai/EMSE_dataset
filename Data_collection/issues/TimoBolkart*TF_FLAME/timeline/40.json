In general, the shape of the neck is correlated to the face shape, so optimizing for the face shape will affect the neck shape. There is not really a parameter that controls only the neck shape, but if you want a more thin neck, you could add some loss during training that penalizes the width of the neck (i.e. select some vertices on left and right side of the neck and just minimize the distance between them). However I have never experimented with this and this might influence the face shape reconstruction negatively, so I advice carefully weighting this term. Does that help?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/726041739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/727947515","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/40#issuecomment-727947515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/40","id":727947515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzk0NzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"enjoybo","id":17981166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTgxMTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17981166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo","html_url":"https://github.com/enjoybo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoybo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T12:27:18Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T12:27:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, the advice you provided helps a lot.
