the demo uses an OpenGL-based viewer to visualize the samples, however that is not essential for sampling the model as you can check the meshes also after writing them to disk. As a workaround, please pull the newest version of the code and run the demo with a flag `--visualize False`, this will disable the visualization.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/620608204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3280323267,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4MDMyMzI2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3280323267","actor":{"login":"WisarutBholsithi","id":58510558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTEwNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58510558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi","html_url":"https://github.com/WisarutBholsithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-28T13:28:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3280323269,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODAzMjMyNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3280323269","actor":{"login":"WisarutBholsithi","id":58510558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTEwNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58510558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi","html_url":"https://github.com/WisarutBholsithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WisarutBholsithi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-28T13:28:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3633107755,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYzMzEwNzc1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3633107755","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T12:47:57Z","state_re
