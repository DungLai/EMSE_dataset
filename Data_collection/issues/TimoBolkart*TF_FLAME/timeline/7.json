The problem is that FLAME (in contrast to BFM or other models) additionally has parameters for pose (i.e. for head rotation around the neck and jaw rotation to open the mouth) which is one reason why it is more expressive than these models. Hence, only considering the shape and expression vectors will be not sufficient as one has to also consider the linear blendskinning for the pose articulation.
