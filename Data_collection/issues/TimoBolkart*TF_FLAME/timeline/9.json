You would need to replace the used distance function (i.e. the distance to the 2D landmarks, 3D landmarks, or the vertex-to-vertex distance in the provided experiments) with this new distance. Please see the FLAME paper for a more extensive and more formal explanation. Having this said, we sadly don't have such a distance publicly available due to licensing issues.
