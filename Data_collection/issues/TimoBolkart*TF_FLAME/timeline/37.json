Maybe check your landmark labels that they correspond with the FLAME landmarks. Once you are sure that everything is correct with the landmarks and you still get extremely distorted shapes, you can choose a higher weight in the code for the different priors (i.e. shape, pose, expression). Increasing these prior weights will regularize the parameters more and therefore constrain the shapes that you will get.


