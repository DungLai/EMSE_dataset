Hello @TimoBolkart,\r\n> I have a similar question. I would like to generate higher resolution textures from a photo than the current resolution of 512x512.\r\n> So far I am able to calculate the `valid_pixel_ids` for higher resolution texture maps. But I am a bit lost on how the `valid_pixel_3d_faces` and the `valid_pixel_b_coords` were obtained.\r\n> Did you use some software (like meshlab) to get the mapping of the pixels of the texture map to the corresponding 3D faces of the mesh? Or are the arrays containing the 3D faces of the mesh and the array containing the UV indices aligned such that the first triangle on the UV map corresponds to the first face of the 3D mesh?\r\n> \r\n> I would be very grateful if you could briefly explain the idea on how to obtain those values.\r\n\r\nI created some texture_data files of resolutions 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, and 2048x2048 which you can download from [here](http://files.is.tue.mpg.de/tbolkart/FLAME/FLAME_texture_data.zip). I updated the code such that depending on the specified file, it outputs texture maps of different resolutions. I hope that helps you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/670493804/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3633059919,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYzMzA1OTkxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3633059919","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T12:32:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3633059922,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MzMwNTk5MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3633059922","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T12:32:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/670495025","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/19#issuecomment-670495025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/19","id":670495025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDQ5NTAyNQ==","user":{"login":"D0miH","id":36657497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjU3NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36657497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH","html_url":"https://github.com/D0miH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/D0miH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T12:36:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T12:36:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That
