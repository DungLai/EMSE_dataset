You can see for instance the demo in the [VOCA](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca) repository that animates the eyelids using FLAME. If your fitting does not close the eyes, this is either due to the supervision (i.e. imprecise eye landmarks) or a too high regularization for the expression parameters. Adding an additional loss to minimize the distance between the eyelid keypoints might help in this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/693593795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3774591762,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc3NDU5MTc2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3774591762","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-16T18:50:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"HarryXD2018","id":42205546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjA1NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42205546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018","html_url":"https://github.com/HarryXD2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarryXD2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-05T03:39:37Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T03:39:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/soubhiksanyal/FLAME_PyTorch/issues/8","id":1188236622,"node_id":"I_kwDODvsYG85G0w1O","number":8,"title":"Parameter
