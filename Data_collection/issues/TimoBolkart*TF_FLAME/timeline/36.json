One option is to get a complete texture from a scan, e.g. the [Headspace dataset](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~nep/research/Headspace/ ) provides registered FLAME meshes for 1216 scans where one could project the original camera images onto to get a complete texture. One option is to use the provided texture space to get a complete texture (but more blurry than a real texture). Another option is to take the incomplete texture and run some texture completion method on. One could also do some fusion, e.g. by fitting FLAME with texture space to an image (e.g. using [this FLAME fitting repo](https://github.com/HavenFeng/photometric_optimization)) and fuse the obtained model texture with the projected image. I guess it depends on your use case.
