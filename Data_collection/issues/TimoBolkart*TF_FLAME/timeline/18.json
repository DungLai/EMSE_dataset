By ignoring the face contour landmarks, the face shape you get by this demo is not optimal. We ignore the contour landmarks as they don't have a fixed embedding but move on a trajectory in the face depending on the rotation angle of the face.\r\nHowever, you can find a dynamic landmark embedding of the contour landmarks into the FLAME face geometry [here](https://github.com/soubhiksanyal/RingNet) which could be used to improve the fitting quality.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/618349949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3280341817,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI4MDM0MTgxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/events/3280341817","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-28T13:32:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
