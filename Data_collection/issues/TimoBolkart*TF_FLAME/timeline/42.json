But we plan to actually release some code soon to fit FLAME to a scan. \r\n\r\n> Also processing each frame (or landmarks) separately to generate a fit FLAME model doesn't sound optimal.\r\n\r\nIndeed, fitting each frame separately is not optimal. Instead one could fit for each frame independently and then optimize some joint loss across multiple frames along with some temporal consistency term. This would make the result temporally coherent.\r\n\r\n> I tried for example 3DDFA_V2 to get animated 3D mesh from video, but I don't have any idea how to transfer such information to a FLAME model.\r\n\r\nI have seen 3DDFA_V2 but never played with it. We have some code available to convert a Basel Face Model mesh to FLAME [here](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/BFM_to_FLAME). I am not sure which subset of BFM vertices 3DDFA_V2 uses, so I am not fully sure if our converter script is compatible with it right now.\r\n\r\n> Any input on this side is more that welcome, I will then also try the path of animation via VOCA\r\n\r\nVOCA is certainly another option to get some FLAME animated mesh from speech only.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/739552263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/comments/743911040","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/42#issuecomment-743911040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/42","id":743911040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzkxMTA0MA==","user":{"login":"5agado","id":1591484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado","html_url":"https://github.com/5agado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5agado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T21:58:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T21:58:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @TimoBolkart for the detailed answer.\r\nLooking forward with excitement to any additional code or research results.
