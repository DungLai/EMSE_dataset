3D landmarks we provide in our demo are extracted from a scan and they have the same unit as FLAME, which is provided in Meters. There are different possibilities \r\n1) fit to 2D landmarks instead (we provide a demo for this), \r\n2) normalize the 3D landmarks such that they are in the same unit as the model (for predicted 3D landmarks this might not be feasible), or \r\n3) optimize for an isotropic scale additionally.\r\n\r\nIf your 3D landmarks are obtained by estimating them from an image, I would recommend fitting to the 2D landmarks instead.
