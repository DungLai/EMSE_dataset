I'm really enjoying playing around with it.\r\nI have tried the fit_2D_landmark demo and since the texture cannot be generated for occluded regions in the 2D image (i.e. ears) I was wondering if there is a pre-scanned complete texture for any subject so that I can use it as a base texture and just update the valid parts with my own image. \r\nOr if you can recommend some other way, that'd be great.\r\n\r\nAlso, is it possible to use a single pre-scanned texture template for all the fitted meshes? (might be a very trivial question, I'm very new to computer graphics :'))\r\nThank you so much again!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kyungjin-lee","id":49276056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mjc2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49276056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/kyungjin-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyungjin-lee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
