I saw the file needs to take in a pre-computed parameter \"target_scale\". I'm wondering how to calculate this parameter if I want to align my own image with its FLAME mesh.\r\n\r\n2. I noticed that the example meshes given (such as imgHQ00039.obj) are not zero-centered. They have offsets from the origin and it seems that this offset is useful for calculating the texture map. How is this offset chosen?\r\n\r\nThanks for answering!","closed_by":{"login":"Ten1o","id":33676526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc2NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33676526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o","html_url":"https://github.com/Ten1o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten1o/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
