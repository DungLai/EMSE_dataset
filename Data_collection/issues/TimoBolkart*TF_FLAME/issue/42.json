I'm playing around with it together with the Blender add-on.\r\n\r\nI was curious about the possibility of fitting animated FLAME models, being it from 2D landmarks or even from videos.\r\nIn the video you showed captured performance from scan, but I believe that you didn't provide the code for that.\r\nAlso processing each frame (or landmarks) separately to generate a fit FLAME model doesn't sound optimal.\r\n\r\nI tried for example [3DDFA_V2](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2) to get animated 3D mesh from video, but I don't have any idea how to transfer such information to a FLAME model.\r\n\r\nAny input on this side is more that welcome, I will then also try the path of animation via VOCA\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
