I'm not an expert and have not read the noisy net paper, but shouldn't the policy be making an exploitation action (no noise) during test period? \r\n\r\nI may have missed this in the code would be happy if it could pointed out to me :)","closed_by":{"login":"junhuang-ifast","id":47650501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47650501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast","html_url":"https://github.com/junhuang-ifast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
