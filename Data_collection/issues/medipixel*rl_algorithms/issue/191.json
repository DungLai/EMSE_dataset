Note that I am using n-step so my loss (`dq_loss_element_wise`) is coming from [here](https://github.com/medipixel/rl_algorithms/blob/e20f61649dc904f9b7e647b5f47d3c82b2b38d29/rl_algorithms/dqn/agent.py#L271) . From [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Curt-Park/rainbow-is-all-you-need/blob/master/03.per.ipynb) tutorial, per_eps is to ensure all transitions are at least sampled once. I am thinking of doing this instead to prevent interruption during training:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# update priorities in PER\r\nloss_for_prior = dq_loss_element_wise.detach().cpu().numpy()\r\nnew_priorities = torch.where(loss_for_prior>0, loss_for_prior+self.hyper_params.per_eps, torch.ones(loss_for_prior.shape)*self.hyper_params.per_eps)\r\nself.memory.update_priorities(indices, new_priorities)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think this change is an acceptable alternative and would not break anything?\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concern that the fact that my loss would go to such large negative values, might mean that there is something fundamentally wrong with my network instead? (my network is a basic 1D-CNN).
