I was hoping to use some of the implementations here for the [MineRL](https://minerl.io/docs/index.html) competition. However, it seems policy-based algorithms like [``A2C,``](https://github.com/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/238)``PPO, SAC, and fD`` do not support ``Dict`` and ``Discrete`` spaces, which is crucial for MineRL (and custom envs in general).\r\n\r\nThere are potential [workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56226133/soft-actor-critic-with-discrete-action-space) as @MrSyee was kind enough to point out, but it would be great if you could introduce minimal support in the near future!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
