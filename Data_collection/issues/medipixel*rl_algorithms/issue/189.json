Is this normal?\r\n\r\nI think since the out of the box Rainbow DQN uses only a few Linear layers, it won't use much GPU, if this is the case, can more tensors from other operations like prioritised replay memory ...etc be moved to the GPU? \r\n\r\nI am not an expert so I am not sure what should/should not be placed on the tensor (in terms of efficiency), but basically my thinking is that if more tensors/operations can be moved onto the GPU, it'll speed up training time? Or maybe this is the standard way of placing tensors/operations in Rainbow DQN?\r\n\r\nAny clarification/suggestions on if its possible to speed up training time, if so how (without additional hardware) would be much appreciated :)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"junhuang-ifast","id":47650501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47650501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast","html_url":"https://github.com/junhuang-ifast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
