you pointed out, Rainbow-DQN doesn't utilize GPU much because it only employs shallow FC layers. Even if you optimize the replay buffer by reducing the CPU-GPU bottleneck, mostly it wouldn't be so effective because of the agent-environment interaction time; Mostly, the overall bottleneck occurs in agent-environment interactions. (Of course, it will depend on the environment you use though.)\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you want to move Replay memory on GPU, firstly you should concern the bottleneck in ADDing transitions, which are returned by env, from CPU to GPU every step. I hope the following idea will be helpful for you.\r\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03138.pdf\r\n- https://github.com/bparr/gpu-experience-replay\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple. It defines a fixed size of a block and updates the block in GPU memory when it is full. \r\n>  The experience replay Variable is partitioned into contiguous blocks of equal size, which is denoted as the \"update-size\". Experiences are queued in RAM until the queue has enough experiences to update the next block. Then the first update-size experiences in the queue are copied to the next update block in the GPU memory using the TensorFlow scatter_update function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/comments/590185019/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Curt-Park","id":14961526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTYxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14961526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park","html_url":"https://github.com/Curt-Park","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Curt-Park/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/comments/590189545","html_url":"https://github.com/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/189#issuecomment-590189545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/189","id":590189545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDE4OTU0NQ==","user":{"login":"junhuang-ifast","id":47650501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47650501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast","html_url":"https://github.com/junhuang-ifast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T07:00:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T07:00:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hmm
