again.\r\n\r\nNow I've got a new question on the implementation. The derivative of the alpha in the implementation is a bit different from the original derivation. In the original derivation, the magnitude of d(alpha) is solely depending on the expectation. On the other side, in the implementation, it depends on its current value and expectation. \r\n\r\nIt might be good to have an adaptive learning size than fixed (the original one). I'm just wondering that is this also intended?
