So your insight is very reasonable approach. In this paper, however, they suggest that to obtain the deterministic optimal solution, the neural network may learn to discard the noise parts. If the network is well trained to make optimal action, it is no longer exploring. Thus it can be used during test period.\r\n\r\nAnd we also thought like your opinion, we tested this idea ago. But it doesn't show a remarkable difference in performance (see [this comment](https://github.com/medipixel/rl_algorithms/blob/e20f61649dc904f9b7e647b5f47d3c82b2b38d29/rl_algorithms/dqn/linear.py#L78)).\r\n\r\nI hope this answer is helpful. Thank you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/comments/589121700/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MrSyee","id":17582508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgyNTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17582508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee","html_url":"https://github.com/MrSyee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3056677572,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA1NjY3NzU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/events/3056677572","actor":{"login":"junhuang-ifast","id":47650501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47650501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast","html_url":"https://github.com/junhuang-ifast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-20T15:26:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3056677575,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNTY2Nzc1NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/events/3056677575","actor":{"login":"junhuang-ifast","id":47650501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47650501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast","html_url":"https://github.com/junhuang-ifast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junhuang-ifast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-20T15:26:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/comments/589127029","html_url":"https://github.com/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/188#issuecomment-589127029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/medipixel/rl_algorithms/issues/188","id":589127029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTEyNzAyOQ==","user":{"login":"MrSyee","id":17582508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgyNTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17582508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee","html_url":"https://github.com/MrSyee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSyee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T15:30:42Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T15:33:18Z","author_associat
