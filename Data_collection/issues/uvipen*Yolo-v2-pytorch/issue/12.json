So, I was wondering why is that? Are you able to get good mAP eventually on the test data. \r\n\r\nI am writing the code for yolo v2 myself in tensorflow and that's an issue I am really suffering from that my model is consistently overfitting just like yours and my output aren't as good as you have shown. I am using adam optimizer. I tried using SGD with momentum and weight decay as well as adam with weight decay but my network doesn't learn anything and the training oscillates without convergence. Have you seen anything of this sort? \r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestion or comments. \r\nBest, \r\nSaurabh \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uvipen/Yolo-v2-pytorch/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uvipen/Yolo-v2-pytorch/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
