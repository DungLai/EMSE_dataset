What happens is that start the process, extract frames than upscale process than upscale reaches 100% than resources usage reduces drastically and stays that way forever.\r\n\r\nIn this picture, i let for 10 hours, something like 1,5 to hours to extract and upscale and more than 8 hours on low resources usage.
