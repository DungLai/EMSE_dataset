You cannot work with webp. (caused by the extracted_frame_format)\r\n\r\nWebP is not a format universally supported by all drivers, but PNG is. It will require some extra work to specify the supported format for each of the drivers. This is technically possible, but I won't have time for this right now.\r\n\r\n> Unlike 3.0.0 an error occurs when you remove an unwanted command line.\r\n\r\n3.0.0 doesn't necessarily have any error detection methods. It really depends on what you remove. It's very hard for Video2X to detect if you have removed something critical. The point of having the configuration file is to give the users more freedom over how they want this software to behave. The trade-off here is its integrity. If you're modifying the configuration file directly, you're expected to know what you're doing.\r\n\r\n> In video2x 4.x.x version, the latest version of waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan cannot be used to utilize multi-GPU.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the GPU ID was an integer. With the recent changes done to it, the format can now be something like `0,1,2`. The GPU ID field, therefore, needs to be parsed as a string. I can make the necessary changes to make v2x support *-ncnn-vulkan's multi-GPU features.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/718808556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/718832983","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/399#issuecomment-718832983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/399","id":718832983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODgzMjk4Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T15:33:13Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T15:33:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"webp works fine with caffe and ncnn-vulkan.\r\nHowever, caffe needed to add webp in `input_extention_list`.\r\nAnime4K and Gifski are not used, so webp support is unknown.\r\nThere is no need to quickly support webp.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/718832983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3958169133,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk1ODE2OTEzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3958169133","actor":null,"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-04T15:33:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
