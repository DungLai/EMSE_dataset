Rather, it's closer to a traditional filter (?)\r\n\r\nYou will get much worse quality using A4K than waifu2x or other ML-based drivers. I do not suggest you to use it unless you want something done quick. If you care about quality, don't use it.\r\n\r\nAlso, A4K benefits tremendously from multi-threading. Using 16 threads is recommended for A4K. 1 thread is recommended for everything else. This is why the number of threads changes to 16 automatically when you choose A4K.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVega 8 isn't competent at all. Don't use it.\r\n\r\nRX 560X is not a compelling card for these things either. ML requires an insane amount of VRAM and computing power. I think the number of hours you're getting is quite normal.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nConsidering you're asking for a 2.5x output, v2x will first have to calculate a 4x output with two 2x iterations, which is to say:\r\n\r\n- 480P -> 960P\r\n- 960P -> 1920P\r\n\r\nLarger the input file, the more time it will take. Watch for the number of passes after the file name for an idea which iteration it's in right now. If it's taking you 4 minutes to upscale a single image from 480P to 960P, then it would take you 4 * 3112 / 60 == 207 hours to upscale the entire video just two times. 4 minutes/image is way too slow. Check [this page](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks) for some benchmarks done with the standard testing clip. A 2080Ti can upscale 240P frames to 1080P frames at around 0.9 frames/second. Notice the unit here.\r\n\r\nThere's also a possibility that waifu2x isn't really using your RX560X. I recommend you to start the upscale and observe your GPU usage in the task manager.

Rather, it's closer to a traditional filter (?)\n> \n> You will get much worse quality using A4K than waifu2x or other ML-based drivers. I do not suggest you to use it unless you want something done quick. If you care about quality, don't use it.\n> \n> Also, A4K benefits tremendously from multi-threading. Using 16 threads is recommended for A4K. 1 thread is recommended for everything else. This is why the number of threads changes to 16 automatically when you choose A4K.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Vega 8 isn't competent at all. Don't use it.\n> \n> RX 560X is not a compelling card for these things either. ML requires an insane amount of VRAM and computing power. I think the number of hours you're getting is quite normal.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Considering you're asking for a 2.5x output, v2x will first have to calculate a 4x output with two 2x iterations, which is to say:\n> \n> - 480P -> 960P\n> - 960P -> 1920P\n> \n> Larger the input file, the more time it will take. Watch for the number of passes after the file name for an idea which iteration it's in right now. If it's taking you 4 minutes to upscale a single image from 480P to 960P, then it would take you 4 * 3112 / 60 == 207 hours to upscale the entire video just two times. 4 minutes/image is way too slow. Check [this page](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks) for some benchmarks done with the standard testing clip. A 2080Ti can upscale 240P frames to 1080P frames at around 0.9 frames/second. Notice the unit here.\n> \n> There's also a possibility that waifu2x isn't really using your RX560X.

I did check the performance tab and apparently it is using 2% of the Vega 8, and the RX 560X is at 0%. CPU ia at 90%+, memory is 50%, disk is 50~70% (I am running a few other apps atm). Is this bad? How do I correctly configure this?\nEdit: nevermind, I got it. Will update for further changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/736341667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Necrolion99","id":75283775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjgzNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75283775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99","html_url":"https://github.com/Necrolion99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/736366420","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/420#issuecomment-736366420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/420","id":736366420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjM2NjQyMA==","user":{"login":"Necrolion99","id":75283775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjgzNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75283775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99","html_url":"https://github.com/Necrolion99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Necrolion99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:56:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T09:56:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So I do as the internet told me.
