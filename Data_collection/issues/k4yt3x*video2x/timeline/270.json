I've been using this method for the implementation.\r\n\r\nBasically what the implementation does is relying on _ffmpeg_ to detect duplicate frames when extracting them. When using mpdecimate _ffmpeg_ will output bit-perfect duplicate _.png_ files, so we can hash them and using the hash as the key of a dictionary entry containing file names as values. After that, we only need to delete duplicate frames and restore them after upscaling.\r\n\r\nThis is not PR ready because I did not implemented a GUI option, only tested on Linux, and also not implemented a CLI option to disable it (but a change in the yaml file is sufficient not to use it).\r\n\r\nIn my tests, it nearly cut in half the amount of frames to be uspcaled, thus improving by a lot the execution time.\r\nIf anyone wants to try it, here is the _.diff_ file :+1: \r\n[remove_duplicate.txt](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/files/6759167/remove_duplicate.txt)\r\n\r\nPS: I don't know if it's the same on Windows, but the _ffprobe_ step to retrieve the number of frames is really slow (nearly 15 minutes to finish on my i7 desktop cpu), I made a change to use _ffmpeg_ instead which terminates in seconds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/873485475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"koplo199","id":85577251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc3MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85577251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199","html_url":"https://github.com/koplo199","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koplo199/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/873490278","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/270#issuecomment-873490278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/270","id":873490278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzQ5MDI3OA==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-04T00:26:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-04T00:26:13Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks

looks like the architecture of 5.0 really is different than 4.x, I'll have a look after the beta branch is released.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I was also using OpenCV2 `absdiff()` in my first tests to compute the differences between two images, but gave up on the idea because comparing images to each other is too slow to be really useful : after all, what's the point of deleting duplicate frames if upscaling them is faster than detecting them ? On the other hand, `mpdecimate` did not add any overhead when extracting frames, and did the same job (if not better), so I went for that solution.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I was using PIL `Image.tobytes()` at first to get the image data, but it was also really slow : using `open()` and then `read()` made the duplication detection step to execute from 25 minutes, to 3 minutes (for more than 35 000 frames), I don't know yet if this optimization could be replicated elsewhere. Using a fast hash algorithm like xxh64 from [xxhash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) also helped performance wise.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Looks like the chosen `mpdecimate` settings were still a bit too aggressive, I changed it to `hi=64*2:lo=64*1:frac=0.01` and it now detects less duplicate frames (~7500 vs ~15 000 before), but  the end result is now visually perfect. I'm upscaling from 1080p to 4k, so more experiment with lower resolution/quality input videos may be needed to find the 'real' sweet spot.

Nice ! I'll probably have a look at it on my free time this weekend. <del> I'm not familiar yet with `ImageChops.difference`, are you comparing each frames to each other or just consecutive ones ? That last method should be a lot faster (given the `O(n)` vs `O(n!)` complexity), and will probably give better results.</del> \r\nEdit : only consecutive frames are compared, which is good\r\n\r\nBut we may still have a problem even with that method : let's consider we set the threshold for duplicate frames at 96%, and that we have frame `A` which is 98% similar to frame `B`, which is itself 97% similar to frame `C`. With this method we'll  says that frames `A`, `B` and `C` are all duplicates, yet we know nothing about the similarity between frames `A` and `C` : it could be 95% (because, at worst, 2% from `A <-> B` + 3% From `B <-> C` = 5%), meaning we are below the threshold, and that the end result would likely not being satisfying. This situation is likely to happens for scene with slow movements : each frame is almost similar to the previous one, but this difference becomes more and more significant as the number of frames grows.\r\n\r\n<del>I've no idea on how to solve this problem, maybe looking at how ffmpeg handle that issue in mpdecimate could help
