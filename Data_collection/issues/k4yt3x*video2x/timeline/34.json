If the audio already is AAC, then there's no problem. However, in your case, the audio stream is in MP3 format. Therefore, ffmpeg tries to extract MP3 into AAC without converting, which doesn't work.\r\n\r\n```\r\nffmpeg -i c:\\something\\op05.avi -vn -acodec copy c:\\something\\output-audio.aac -y\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think what I have to do is to specify the extracted audio's format, which is to do what you did -- changing `-acodec copy` into `-acodec aac`. However, I'm not sure if that's going to cause any other problems. I'll try this pending solution with some other videos and check if the patch is stable.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want, I have your video upscaled. I can share it with you so you don't need to run it again.\r\nHere's the video:
