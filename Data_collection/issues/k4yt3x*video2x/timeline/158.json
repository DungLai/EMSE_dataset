when I ran video2x with Waifu2x-Caffe yesterday and it worked, I was only using one thread, so that could be it. But when I did, the progress bar stopped updating after 2%. Then it upscaled the rest of the frames without updating the % or making them into a video. Now I have a whole bunch of HD frames that I'll have to turn back into a video manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/546572864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Mirrorman95","id":2261216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjEyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2261216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95","html_url":"https://github.com/Mirrorman95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mirrorman95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/546624326","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/158#issuecomment-546624326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/158","id":546624326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjYyNDMyNg==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-26T17:41:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T17:41:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"That's strange.
