I don't have the dev environment to debug the old 4.8.1 version either.\r\n\r\nv2x was completely redesigned in 5.0.0 and this problem shouldn't exist in 5.0.0. The issue here is that it only supports command line so far as I haven't written a GUI for it. I also haven't added Anime4K support for it yet since the newest A4K is written in GLSL or C++ if I want to use Anime4KCPP. I'll need to figure out how to write a Python FFI for those two libraries to be able to use them.\r\n\r\nWith that said, 5.0.0 does run quite well with waifu2x, SRMD, RealSR, and RIFE.
