Lots of programs install their binaries into `C:\\Program Files` by default, not the desktop. Similarly, the setup script installs the dependencies into `%LOCALAPPDATA%` because it's a standard place for applications to store static non-temp data. If you want to make it possible for the script to install dependencies in other directories via an argument, please open a new issue. The setup script wasn't supposed to be bulky. Like the Ubuntu setup script, it's only supposed to provide a standard easy-install. If you want to use v2x the easy way, use the release.
