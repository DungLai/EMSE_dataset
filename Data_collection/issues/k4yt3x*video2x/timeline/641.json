Try processing the [standard test clip](https://files.k4yt3x.com/Resources/Videos/standard-test.mp4) first just to make sure that the baseline works. If it does, it's a problem with the subtitle. I already have the code in place to disable the copying of subtitles and stuff with a single parameter. I can push an update in the next beta if this turns out to be the case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1110660573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1110674679","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/641#issuecomment-1110674679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/641","id":1110674679,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc5CM4z3","user":{"login":"wesleyorama2","id":23392516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzkyNTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23392516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2","html_url":"https://github.com/wesleyorama2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleyorama2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-27T07:58:11Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T07:58:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"its processing the test clip...
