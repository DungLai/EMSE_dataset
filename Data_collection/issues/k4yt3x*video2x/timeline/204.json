Old versions may contain major bugs or issues that are fixed in newer versions. I therefore strongly suggest you to use the newest version.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, here are some suggestions to your current settings.\r\n\r\n- Multithreading is not recommended for waifu2x, since one of my previous experiments discovered that hyperthreading waifu2x doesn't really give you much performance improvements. Leaving threads to 1 is recommended.\r\n- If you set Preserve Frames to 1, then it will never delete the cache files, leaving you a lot of clutter on your disk. It has been set to 0 (False) by default in 2.10.0.\r\n\r\nThe next step I would take in this situation is to **open the Task Manager and observe the CUDA usage to see if waifu2x-caffe is actually using your GPU**. If you're not sure how to do it, refer to [this link](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/Q&A#no-gpu-usage).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/588596646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/588608921","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/204#issuecomment-588608921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/204","id":588608921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODYwODkyMQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T04:54:13Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T04:54:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the advice!
