I might try that.\r\nIf you can send information on your ubuntu bundle for 5.0.0 I would be interested to give it a go.\r\n\r\nI've got a bunch of VCR captured home videos from the 90's of varying quality I would like to improve if possible. It would be great to get it working.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of interest I found these guys https://audo.ai/ for fixing up sound. I uploaded a 2 minute sound file extracted from a vhs capture with a lot of mains power hum an poor volume on the voices. It removed the background noise completely. It wasn't  100% perfect but close. Just thought I'd mention it in case anyone is doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nMany

refer to [this](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/#docker-image) and [this](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Docker) for a quick-start on the usage of the Docker image.\r\n\r\nPre-compiled drivers are required for the beta version. You can download them [here](https://files.k4yt3x.com/Projects/Video2X/wrappers.tar.gz). You will need to roughly follow the following steps:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# clone this project's git repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x\r\ncd video2x/video2x\r\ngit checkout -t origin/5.0.0-beta\r\n\r\n# download the pre-compiled wrappers\r\nwget https://files.k4yt3x.com/Projects/Video2X/wrappers.tar.gz\r\ntar xzf wrappers.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to install some Python packages, but some of the repos in the `requirements.txt` are still WIP. You can manually install these packages with a pip command.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21986859/132204290-94d457ac-69a0-4f38-816b-10c198010ea9.png)\r\n\r\nAfter these commands, you should have a directory structure similar to this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21986859/132203658-f7bc2367-82c2-4b0f-935d-46f4ce3d535b.png)\r\n\r\nThen, you can up one level in the directory structure back to the root of this repo. You will end up in video2x/video2x from the last step, and you'll need to go back to just video2x. Finally, you can run video2x as a python module. The command below upscales `input.mp4` with waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan with noise=3 into `output.mp4`. The ratio is determined dynamically and automatically.
