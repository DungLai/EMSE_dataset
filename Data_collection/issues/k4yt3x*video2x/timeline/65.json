Why not implement a way to send chunks of image at a time? Like a queue with chunks of 500 or 1000 images (user defined). If the user decide to pause, than queue pauses at the end of the current chunk.\r\n\r\nI also find 12 to 20 hours to upscale a lot of time. And it's common to just need to use the PC at some point. If I can create chunks that last 15 minutes, this should be perfect as it'll put the work on hold.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/642253449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tamodolo","id":9446795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDY3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9446795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo","html_url":"https://github.com/tamodolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamodolo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/642389869","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/65#issuecomment-642389869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/65","id":642389869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjM4OTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T03:52:21Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T03:52:21Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@tamodolo Dandere2x is using the approach you described, but I'm trying to consider a different approach that doesn't require chunking.
