They'll be coming in later beta versions. In fact model selection is already implemented on my local branch, and multi-GPU is already queued. Although a lot of the code has already been written, I might still overhaul the project yet again to make it compatible with k8s clusters (which requires components to be less coupled).\r\n\r\nUsually speaking, the default GPU selected by *-ncnn-vulkan is the most powerful GPU on your machine, so I left it til now. I'll add an option soon to allow users to change it. I still don't know how to get a reliable list of Vulkan-compatible GPUs and their corresponding IDs... so you'll have to run the program and see the output to see what the GPUs are and their IDs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1058150027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6178929736,"node_id":"LE_lADOB1EkMc5FC7mrzwAAAAFwSvxI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/6178929736","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-03T15:21:39Z","label":{"name":"state:Queued","color":"F9D0C4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6178930050,"node_id":"AE_lADOB1EkMc5FC7mrzwAAAAFwSv2C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/6178930050","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-03T15:21:42Z","assignee":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1059215283","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/607#issuecomment-1059215283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/607","id":1059215283,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc4_Ilez","user":{"login":"Cat-Lady","id":6075406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6075406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady","html_url":"https://github.com/Cat-Lady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/followers","following_url

you for the answer. I was suspecting that - due to the fact that `lavapipe` is virtual vulkan implementation on CPU - it might be reporting \"better\" capabilities than real GPU.\r\n\r\nFor now, I was able to bypass the issue by checking Vulkan ICDs (`ls /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d`), and manually selecting the one(s) I want to use by `export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json` in my case). it can be, actually, a comma-separated list of ICDs exported as this env variable. Anything that doesn't get exported will become \"invisible\" to `video2x` (or any vulkan-needing application started after this env is set), so virtual or unwanted ones can get \"hidden\" this way.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think that parsing ICDs might be your answer to find Vulkan-capable GPUs, at least on linux-based machines.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/CatLady","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1059215283/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cat-Lady","id":6075406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6075406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady","html_url":"https://github.com/Cat-Lady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1059748969","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/607#issuecomment-1059748969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/607","id":1059748969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc4_Knxp","user":{"login":"nihui","id":171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui","html_url":"https://github.com/nihui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-05T11:47:07Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T11:47:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\n

I was suspecting that - due to the fact that `lavapipe` is virtual vulkan implementation on CPU - it might be reporting \"better\" capabilities than real GPU.\r\n> \r\n> For now, I was able to bypass the issue by checking Vulkan ICDs (`ls /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d`), and manually selecting the one(s) I want to use by `export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json` in my case). it can be, actually, a comma-separated list of ICDs exported as this env variable. Anything that doesn't get exported will become \"invisible\" to `video2x` (or any vulkan-needing application started after this env is set), so virtual or unwanted ones can get \"hidden\" this way.\r\n> \r\n> BTW, I think that parsing ICDs might be your answer to find Vulkan-capable GPUs, at least on linux-based machines.\r\n> \r\n> Cheers, /CatLady\r\n\r\nHi!! I am running Kubuntu LTS 20.04. My GTX 1080 Ti is not being used by Video2x. I have tried to use your comments to force my GPU usage, but my attempt was unsuccessful.

I also understand that in the future, author will provide a way to detect and use GPU automatically, or so. Thanks in advance...
