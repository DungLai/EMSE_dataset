I looked through [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) packages in my arch linux, there were:\r\n- waifu2x\r\n- waifu2x-converter-cpp\r\n- waifu2x-converter-glsl\r\n\r\nSo, I suppose that both waifu2x and waifu2x-converter-cpp are cross-platform. The problem is that linux users may install any possible dependecies by themselves. In that way, I suggest you to write separate shell script for bash/ksh/etc which will search for it and generate configuration for this system.  For example, `which` shell command searches in PATH variable for command you specified in it argument and returns it absolute path.\r\n\r\nP.S.

throwing in my +1 for this. Only reason I'm running a Windows VM at the moment is for this alone and it'd be nice to trim the fat on my VM box and run a barebones *nix install with the GPU passed to it.\r\n\r\nLooking at the documentation on the packages listed above it does appear the upstream [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) package that they pull from supports CUDA so it should be good to go. So either someone can see if it is available in their repo (as Smarthard mentioned, Arch has it and looks to be pretty up to date. I haven't been able to confirm debian or Ubuntu have it in-repo) or just simply 'compile' it which seems to not even need that and boils down to just installing its own pre-requisite packages.\r\n\r\nPersonally if it comes down to a concern over ease of install I'd do like most other *nix projects and just say 'this is a pre-req, go to this git project and install it'.

well, this project seems to be no more maintained - the latest commit was in May, 2017. Maybe it would be better to use `waifu2x-converter-cpp`?\r\n\r\nI've found an issue with [Arch PKGBUILD](https://github.com/tanakamura/waifu2x-converter-cpp/issues/4). But nothing interesting there and I still don't know how to simplify installation process for debian-family or whatever else Linux distro. However, waifu2x-converter-cpp from AUR has installed easily and works out of the box.\r\n\r\nP.S. I think it's nothing to worry about if video2x couldn't run at any Linux right away. We just can start from setting it up and testing at Arch Linux and after it continue to add support for

been using Video2x on Mint 19.2 (Ubuntu 18.04) for a bit now without issue.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants to run Video2X on Linux it's surprisingly easy.  Here are some easy to follow instructions to get Video2X setup on your machine:\r\n\r\nInstall Dependencies (mostly for waifu2x-caffe):\r\n--\r\n`sudo apt install build-essential git linux-headers-$(uname -r) libboost-all-dev libgflags-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgoogle-glog-dev libhdf5-dev liblmdb-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libatlas-base-dev libpython3-all-dev python3-pip python3-numpy python-numpy doxygen libmsgpack-dev ffmpeg`\r\n\r\nCUDA 10 && CuDNN:\r\n--\r\n(I tried CUDA 9, but couldn't get waifu2x-caffe to work for some sort of reason.  I kept getting core dumps.)\r\n\r\n**Build CMake**:\r\n**NOTE**: CUDA 10.0+ requires at least CMake 3.12.2+.  You can see if your version is new enough by typing in `cmake --version`.\r\n\r\nIf CMake is not new enough, you can use snap to update your version:\r\n`sudo apt remove cmake`  (To get rid of your distro's version of cmake, or bad things could happen.)\r\n`sudo apt install snap; sudo snap install cmake`\r\n\r\nOr if your system doesn't have snap, build cmake from scratch:\r\n`sudo apt remove cmake`  (To get rid of your distro's version of cmake, or bad things could happen.)\r\n`cd ~; git clone --branch release https://github.com/Kitware/CMake.git`\r\n`cd CMake; ./bootstrap; make -jN`  Where N is your number of cores\r\n`sudo make install`\r\n\r\n**Graphics Drivers (optional)**:\r\nI recommend the ubuntu nvidia driver ppa, as it will give the cutting edge driver.  (Fun fact: If you game on Steam and have CUDA 10.1 installed on your system, it requires the PPA version, because the version on the official NVidia website does not have the required 32bit libraries.)\r\n\r\n`sudo sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa`\r\n`sudo apt update; sudo apt install nvidia-graphics-drivers-NNN`  Where NNN is the newest version shown at https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa or found via `apt-cache search nvidia-graphics-drivers-`\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: For driver changes you will need to reboot before running Video2x.\r\n\r\n**CUDA 10**:\r\nUnfortunately I don't believe there is a ppa, so CUDA has to be downloaded from NVidia's web site @ https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads.  I recommend not installing the out of date video driver that comes with CUDA.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**:  I had to add `/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin` to my PATH in `sudo vim /etc/environment`, which then takes effect after a reboot.  (For many distros you want to add it to `~/.bash_profile` or similar.)\r\n\r\n**CuDNN**:\r\nGoto https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn and create a free dev account, if you haven't already.  Grab both `cuDNN Runtime Library for Ubuntu18.04 (Deb)` and `cuDNN Developer Library for Ubuntu18.04 (Deb)`.\r\n\r\nThese can be installed by `cd ~/Downloads` and then using dpkg.  For example:\r\n`sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7_7.6.3.30-1+cuda10.1_amd64.deb libcudnn7-dev_7.6.3.30-1+cuda10.1_amd64.deb`\r\n\r\nBuild waifu2x-caffe-ubuntu:\r\n--\r\nVideo2x uses this to do the upscaling.\r\n\r\n`cd ~; git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x-caffe-ubuntu.git; cd waifu2x-caffe-ubuntu/; git clone https://github.com/nagadomi/caffe.git`\r\n`mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..`\r\n`make -jN`  Where N is your number of cores\r\n`sudo mkdir /usr/lib/libcaffe; sudo cp libcaffe/lib/libcaffe.so /usr/lib/libcaffe/` (This installs caffe.)\r\n`cp waifu2x-caffe ../bin/`  (For waifu2x-caffe to work it is required to be in the bin folder)\r\n\r\n(Found at: https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x-caffe-ubuntu/blob/ubuntu/INSTALL-linux.md  Working and obtained on 2019-08-25)\r\n\r\n\r\nSetup Video2X:\r\n--\r\n`cd ~; git clone https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x.git`\r\n\r\n**Copy waifu2x-caffe to Video2X**:\r\n`cd video2x/bin; cp -r ~/waifu2x-caffe-ubuntu/bin/ waifu2x-caffe`\r\n\r\n(Waifu2x-caffe is not being installed into /usr/local/bin like a normal program, because it requires files in the same folder that I'm not comfortable putting into bin.)\r\n\r\n**Install Video2X's dependencies:**\r\n`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nModify Video2X to work on Linux:\r\n--\r\nVideo2X is not designed for Linux atm, so I modified some of the code to get it working.  By the time you're reading this, these issues might be fixed:\r\n\r\n**Bug fix 1: (required)**\r\nVideo2X uses absolute paths instead of relative paths.  Without this fix Video2X can't find the programs it's calling.\r\n\r\nvideo2x.json, line 3:\r\nSwitch \r\n```\r\n\"waifu2x_caffe_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\K4YT3X\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\video2x\\\\waifu2x-caffe\\\\waifu2x-caffe-cui.exe\",\r\n``` \r\nwith \r\n```\r\n\"waifu2x_caffe_path\": \"waifu2x-caffe/waifu2x-caffe\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nvideo2x.json, line 59:\r\nSwitch \r\n```\r\n\"ffmpeg_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\K4YT3X\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\video2x\\\\ffmpeg-latest-win64-static\\\\bin\",\r\n```\r\nwith \r\n```\r\n\"ffmpeg_path\": \"\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nffmpeg.py, line 33\r\nSwitch\r\n```\r\nself.ffmpeg_binary = self.ffmpeg_path / 'ffmpeg.exe'\r\nself.ffmpeg_probe_binary = self.ffmpeg_path / 'ffprobe.exe\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\nself.ffmpeg_binary = self.ffmpeg_path / 'ffmpeg'\r\nself.ffmpeg_probe_binary = self.ffmpeg_path / 'ffprobe'\r\n```\r\n\r\nvideo2x.py, line 230\r\nSwitch\r\n```\r\n    if not re.match('^[a-z]:', config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path'], re.IGNORECASE):\r\n        config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path'] = current_directory / config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path']\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\n    #if not re.match('^[a-z]:', config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path'], re.IGNORECASE):\r\n    #    config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path'] = current_directory / config['ffmpeg']['ffmpeg_path']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bug fix 2: (required)**\r\nWithout this change ffmpeg errors out.\r\n\r\nffmpeg.py, line 287:\r\nSwitch \r\n```\r\nreturn subprocess.run(execute, shell=True, check=True).returncode\r\n``` \r\nwith \r\n```\r\nreturn subprocess.run(execute, check=True).returncode\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bug fix 3: (optional)**\r\nVideo2X by default doesn't support embedded fonts in mkvs, which is pretty common in anime.
