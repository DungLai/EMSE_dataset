Does the issue persist?\r\n\r\nWith Waifu2x Caffe it runs way too slow to test, even with GPU. Around 2.5s/it when setting it to use either cudnn or gpu.\r\nIf I set the model to \"anime_style_art\" I get 1.2s/it though.\r\nWaifu2x Converter CPP also has horrendous speed at 2s/it and it's barely even using my CPU or GPU. CPU jumping around 6-17% and GPU 4-9%.\r\nI don't have \"Disable GPU\" checked so I dunno why it's that slow.\r\nWaifu2x NCNN Vulkan is significantly faster at around 2.4it/s. But it's not using any of my CPU and is only using about 30-35% GPU. And the estimated time for a 480p video with the length of 5 minutes and a scale ratio of 3.0 is gonna take 2 hours and 20 minutes. Whereas Anime4KCPP took 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nI think I found the issue though. It's when I turn on \"GPU Mode\" for Anime4KCPP. If I don't use that, there are no black lines. However, it takes maybe 4 times longer to upscale video or 2 with fast mode on lol.\r\nI might have found a workaround though. If I turn on \"CNN Mode\" the black lines are gone. However, that slows down the upscale by about 50% from 80it/s to 38it/s. I can turn on fast mode though which brings it back up to 74it/s.\r\nDownside to CNN though is that every line becomes incredibly thick.\r\nCNN off:\r\n![Anime4KCPP GPU](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90092517/134523669-3637e472-8ddb-445f-8337-f5e50fb7c41b.png)\r\nCNN on:\r\n![Anime4KCPP GPU+CNN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90092517/134523747-13cb9244-d228-4199-a0f0-b7ea53ae5c3d.png)\r\n\r\nSmall sidenote:\r\nMy GPU is a GTX1080 so not exactly the best.\r\nBut my CPU is a Ryzen R9 5900X","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/925858156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TechnoMasterBoy","id":90092517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDkyNTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90092517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy","html_url":"https://github.com/TechnoMasterBoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TechnoMasterBoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/926021539","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/550#issuecomment-926021539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/550","id":926021539,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc43Mfej","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T17:40:41Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T17:40:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> It's when I turn on \"GPU Mode\" for Anime4KCPP.
