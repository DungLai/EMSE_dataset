Select for your video engine the Real-CUGAN - settings are good as they are. \r\nThen in the home page turn off video frame interpolation (we don't need to change fps).\r\nThen in the home page choose your video scale (2 or 4) and then below choose video denoise I put mine -1 as it's best.\r\nI have an Nvidia card so I can benefit from RTX and Cuda.\r\n\r\n*I should note your experience may not be the same. My video had specific styling making Realcugan the only option that looked right. I recommend u try others and see how u go. For example RealSR might be for you etc....\r\nOne hint is while it's rendering look inside the rendering folders to see the first frame of the updscaled clip - if you don't like it press clear a couple times to cancel, change settings and try again. Saves so much time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1125793018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simplyexperimental","id":62986011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTg2MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62986011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental","html_url":"https://github.com/simplyexperimental","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplyexperimental/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1125833360","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/647#issuecomment-1125833360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/647","id":1125833360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc5DGtqQ","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T09:16:47Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T09:16:47Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Did you come to the wrong project?
