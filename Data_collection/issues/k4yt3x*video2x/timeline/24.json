I love getting useful and well structured suggestions like yours from the community.\r\n\r\nAnd to answer each of your points:\r\n\r\n1. Yes, I agree that video2x isn't handling streams very well. I'll have to read deeper into how video/audio streams work before I can enhance the experience properly.\r\n\r\n1. You can already add FFMPEG arguments manually in `video2x.json` in a few updates ago, but I still want to give the user more control over what's being passed to FFMPEG. You can also define the encoding by just changing the suffix of the output video I believe. As for extra arguments for `waifu2x-caffe`, I'll make it happen.\r\n\r\n1. That's a good idea, I'll add a cache folder setting in the config file

think I've figured out the stream bit after toying around with ffmpeg and finding some obscure superuser.com posts. This is essentially what I have come up with:\r\n\r\n`ffmpeg -i ORIG_VIDEO.mkv -i upscaled\\no_audio.mp4 -map 1:v:0 -map 0 -c copy -map -0:v FINAL_MUX.mkv`\r\n\r\nThis is assuming the original video is still intact during this process which it should be. We are initially pulling in both the original with all streams as well as the newly upscaled video only stream. **-map 1 :v :0** says we want to start right off the top with the newly upscaled video stream from the second input file to take precedence as stream 0 in the final mux. **-map 0** has us taking every stream, video, audio, subtitles, and otherwise, from the original video and **-c copy** obviously has us copying it all over without any re-encoding. **-map -0:v** (see the extra hyphen at -0, which eluded me for some time as an option) says any video streams in the original video we will ignore and will not make it into the final mux.\r\n\r\nAs for the ffmpeg arguments bit, I am aware of that. However in its current state it applies to all stages that use ffmpeg equally which may not be desired. ie: The scenario I made above about needing to crop the source video before exporting frames. That crop filter will not apply well on the h264 encode after everything is upscaled for example. I will admit, however, that it may be a limited use case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally certain options in ffmpeg are sensitive to what order the arguments are in which makes it even more of a pain. Honestly I'm not even sure at this point how to accomplish that in the cleanest way possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/438329947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cr08","id":1199481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08","html_url":"https://github.com/cr08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/439202211","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/24#issuecomment-439202211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/24","id":439202211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTIwMjIxMQ==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T21:47:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T21:47:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@cr08 Thanks for the explaination for the map option.\r\n\r\nThe most ideal way for this project to be written will be to use the python-ffmpeg library instead of the ffmpeg binary.
