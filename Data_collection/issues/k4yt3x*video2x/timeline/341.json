versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/684402220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3712962693,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzcxMjk2MjY5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3712962693","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T06:04:21Z","label":{"name":"type:Enhancement","color":"54aaff"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3712962694,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3MTI5NjI2OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3712962694","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T06:04:21Z","label":{"name":"type:Question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3712963046,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3MTI5NjMwNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3712963046","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T06:04:25Z","label":{"name":"type:Discussion","color":"bfdadc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3712963681,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzcxMjk2MzY4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3712963681","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2OD

You do have some good points there, but is it really worth it to sacrifice benefits of the newer versions for backwards compatibility?\r\n\r\nI mean, it depends on what those benefits are. I could understand if there was a significantly large feature added that the author / maintainers decide to use, however, at the time of making the issue (and now assuming you didn't add any more 3.8 features), the only 3.8 features you used were assignment expressions, which were syntactic sugar, \r\n\r\nThe general rule is to support the versions of the language that are still supported, assuming not large feature of the most recent version is necessary. For example, Python 3.4 is EOL, so I'm not gonna fault anyone for using a Python 3.5 feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, Python 3.6[.5] isn't expected to be EOL until after the first few months of 2022, according to the PEP, and making the small modifications I mentioned would allow Python 3.6 support.\r\n\r\n> Running from source, from what I see, is only for developers and advanced users who are willing to fiddle with things such as the Python versions.\r\n\r\nNot really, plenty of people run from source all the time, mostly because of security paranoia (ability to audit the code that's running, there's no guarantee that your release does what it says it does). Further, there are plenty of users that wouldn't call themselves developers or even advanced users, but still run from source in order to make incredibly minor changes-- for example, the way that \"ffmpeg\" is looked for on windows assumes that the only thing starting with \"ffmpeg\" in that directory is \"ffmpeg.exe\", however, the standard [@m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite](https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite) also builds a \"ffmpeg\" link meant only to be used internally by the build process (as well as later on, if you wanted to use ffmpeg from within mingw).\r\n\r\nBut most of all, some people just don't want bloat on their systems. In using the binary, there is an extra download of *at least* Python (in fact, I believe the 32 bit version at that), and maybe even an extra download of the necessary libraries (I'm unfamiliar of the build options you have at your disposal / which you use). If the standard user used programs like this, their hard drive would be filling up with embedded versions of Python every time, whereas instead they could simply install Python, then download the master branch and run the main file.\r\n\r\nIn fact this is to some extent, the entire point of the fact that in Python you can make packages that install scripts. Then you release your package, and people can just do a `pip install`, some even get a graphical user interface. Then your binary release, if you choose to do so, for those other users, uses the pip package.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/688782858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"13steinj","id":10525230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj","html_url":"https://github.com/13steinj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/13steinj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3746897777,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQzNzQ2ODk3Nzc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3746897777","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-09T17:08:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/690705333","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/341#issuecomment-690705333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/341","id":690705333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDcwNTMzMw==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-10T20:22:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T20:22:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I think you have a fair point.
