I remember correctly I got that error two weeks ago, when I finished the upscaling I got two files: a **.mkv** and a **.mp4** where one of them was corrupted. Anyway, if your input file that you were upscaling is an **.mkv**, in the **GUI** you must change the **Output** and **Video Output Extension** _(what is underlined in red in the attached image)_ from **.mp4** to **.mkv** for it to work correctly. If you enabled the **Preserve Frames** option in the **GUI** you could still just do the video through **FFmpeg** with the commands that the **CLI** uses for the **Video Assembly** process so you don't need to upscale it again.
