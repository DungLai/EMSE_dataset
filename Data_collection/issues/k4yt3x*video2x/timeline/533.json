I was actually thinking about bring it into the AUR when 5.0.0 is stable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn 4.0.0, the cache directory location can be changed in the configuration file (`video2x.yaml`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21986859/128440614-df5fc84b-b2bb-4c68-b0fc-5fd3f579a1b7.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVersion 5.0.0 will use a stream server model so there won't be all those intermediate frames that take up so much space.\r\n\r\nRealSR has a fixed 4x upscaling ratio. There's no changing that unless you train the models yourself. If you set 2x instead of 4x, Video2X will simply upscale it by 4x then downscale with Lanczos back to 2x. It may actually take a bit longer since each frame will also have to go through a round of Lanczos. (This caveat will be documented after 5.0.0 is done.)\r\n\r\nYes I know it's kinda inflexible when you look at the implementation details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/893929226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/894013622","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/533#issuecomment-894013622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/533","id":894013622,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc41SZC2","user":{"login":"Rmdhn1","id":54092365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDkyMzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54092365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1","html_url":"https://github.com/Rmdhn1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rmdhn1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T05:35:34Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T05:35:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"alright,
