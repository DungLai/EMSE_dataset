This is why do don't see any CUDA utilization rates.\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended to use multi-processing for machine-learning based drivers. Use only one process unless you're running Anime4KCPP. It's better to increase the crop/tile size for machine-learning-based drivers. In waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan's case, it will be the tile size. This value defaults to 400. You can increase it until the VRAM required exceeds what your card can provide.\r\n\r\nYou can also tune waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan's parameters like changing de-noise level to 3 from 2. You may also want to give waifu2x-caffe a try. I've noticed it producing outputs with less artifacts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/745478836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4116037319,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQxMTYwMzczMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/4116037319","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-15T18:28:19Z","label":{"name":"type:Question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/745707719","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/426#issuecomment-745707719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/426","id":745707719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTcwNzcxOQ==","user":{"login":"Kameechewa","id":3394096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTQwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3394096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa","html_url":"https://github.com/Kameechewa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T01:40:18Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T01:40:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah ok, thank you for the explanation.
