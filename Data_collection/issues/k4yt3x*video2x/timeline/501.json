it might be a moot point with the change to using a frame server. The one thing about these apps is that you can run a video through them rather than individual frame images, so maybe they could be used in the future as post-processing after upscaling the input videos through the planned frame server (pretty much just denoising & artifact reduction).\r\n\r\nSimilar to this, Nvidia also has their NGX toolkit (seems to be what the filters in their Nvidia Broadcast app is based on) that also can do upscaling (multiples of 2, 4, and 8) but the current version is pretty broken where the samples don't even seem to work. This has one app for image upscaling (`isr.exe` which stands for `Image Super resolution`) and another for video upscaling (`vsr.exe` which stands for `Video Super Resolution`)\r\n\r\nThe more interesting one from the NGX toolkit is the `slomo` app that's supposed to interpolate given footage. Right now it's just as broken as the rest of the NGX apps, and it also only allows users to specify how many frames to insert between existing frames (IE: `insert 1 frame` means a 30 fps video will become 60 fps).\r\n\r\nFigured I'd provide some info on all of it and let you look into it whenever you have free time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/827673557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterAP23","id":14364070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzY0MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14364070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterAP23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterAP23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/833702320","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/501#issuecomment-833702320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/501","id":833702320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzcwMjMyMA==","user":{"login":"mirh","id":9366725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjY3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9366725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh","html_url":"https://github.com/mirh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T17:21:30Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:21:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"MIT has no problems getting merged into GPL stuff.
