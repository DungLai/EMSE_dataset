Then there would be no sound unless I went all the way to the beginning. This is a bug with ffmpeg's interleaving of the streams and adding -max_interleave_delta 0 seems to fix it, though reading the documentation implies that it changes things and might introduce issues with buffering, I have not encountered any issues though\r\n\r\nThe following is from the documentation:\r\nmax_interleave_delta integer (output)\r\n\r\n    Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration is expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 10000000 (10 seconds).\r\n\r\n    To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly, libavformat will wait until it has at least one packet for each stream before actually writing any packets to the output file. When some streams are \"sparse\" (i.e. there are large gaps between successive packets), this can result in excessive buffering.\r\n\r\n    This field specifies the maximum difference between the timestamps of the first and the last packet in the muxing queue, above which libavformat will output a packet regardless of whether it has queued a packet for all the streams.\r\n\r\n    If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until it has a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum timestamp difference between the buffered packets.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/867123748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MadScientist75","id":32380729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzgwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32380729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75","html_url":"https://github.com/MadScientist75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MadScientist75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1013295184","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/356#issuecomment-1013295184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/356","id":1013295184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc48ZahQ","user":{"login":"mirh","id":9366725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjY3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9366725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh","html_url":"https://github.com/mirh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-14T16:57:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-14T16:57:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could this be related to variable frame rate? #382","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1013295184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirh","id":9366725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjY3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9366725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh","html_url":"https://github.com/mirh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
