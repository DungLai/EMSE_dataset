the reason it failed but that was with SRMD not with Caffe. I do not use it with more than 1 usually. I first saw you advice against it in a other issue thread before I submitted the issue. This was just a test for myself. But I noticed that it ended up in the logfile. So that is the only reason I mentioned it because that might be a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nIt was merely to push through fast as possible so I know it runs. And it did finish within a day. Furthermore I needed to know if the PC is fine and without any crashes.\r\n\r\nI will now test each upscaler anyway under secure options. 1 process, 4k output, ffmpeg set to film. All else is standard. If there are issues I will report them :)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15214766/106335449-1f4d4300-628d-11eb-87e1-b1b836b6cca8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will as said take a lot of time.\r\nWe may close this specific issue if you wish.\r\nStill unclear why caffe gets an error... hopefully others report the same so we are able to pinpoint it. I suspect over the next months I will get a 1080. Then I try caffe again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/770093100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Legion495","id":15214766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE0NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15214766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495","html_url":"https://github.com/Legion495","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Legion495/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/770160754","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/451#issuecomment-770160754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/451","id":770160754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDE2MDc1NA==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-30T05:27:56Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T05:27:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks.
