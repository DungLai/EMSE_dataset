And I don't feel like setting up Python runtime and run the uncompiled version at this point because I don't have a need for super high resolution printing yet.\r\n\r\nBy the way, is it possible to have the pixel limit only applied to the input image/video but not intermediate or output image/video? That would further future-proof the tool, and can probably mean that the pixel limit doesn't have to go too high.\r\n\r\nBoth for digital painting and for video shooting it's hard to get past 100MP due to hardware limits, making the current pixel limit sufficient for input image/video, and only the output can go past that when printing at both large scale and high
