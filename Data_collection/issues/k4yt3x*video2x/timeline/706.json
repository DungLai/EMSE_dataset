a week of head scratching, I think I have found the issue, but not solved it.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps I took - \r\n1. ) If I understand the source correctly, my bug occurs when one of two events occurs (i.e. giving Video2x an input file, by button or drag&drop): _self.input_select_file_button.clicked.connect(self.select_input_file)_ **OR** _def dropEvent(self, event):_\r\n\r\n2.1) The first line common to both of those section of code is _self.update_output_path()_\r\n2.2) I noticed that the crash occurs before the GUI updates the _Input Selection_ box with a file type.\r\n\r\n3.1) Video2x attempts to use the _magic_ external library to scrape the file type and extension\r\n3.2) If that fails, Video2x implements if/elseif to deturmine the file type and extension\r\n\r\n4.1) Whilst troubleshooting, I made a mistake. Instead of drag&dropping the large ~3.2GB _.m4v_ video I had been using, I misclicked and grabbed a ~16GB _.mkv_ file. I expected it to crash, it did not!\r\n4.2) I made two identical copies of my ~3.2GB test file. One I kept with original file extension, the other I renamed _.mp4_ as I know the underlying video codec is exactly the same. I tried this one, and it worked!\r\n\r\n5.) I tried using the _Waifu2x-Extension-GUI_ project linked from this Git page. I noticed that this related program did not accept _.m4v_ files whatsoever\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is what I think is happening - \r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, the _magic_ library is perfectly happy with _.m4v_ files up to precisely 2.0GiB (as previously discussed). However, for files larger than that, the function must return some unexpected values.\r\nWhen execution passes back into the _update_output_path_ function, either:\r\n- _magic_ was able to call this file a _video_, but _self.video_output_extension_line_edit.text()_ equals some incorrect value and casues a crash\r\n- _magic_ does not identify the file type, so when _suffix = input_path.suffix_, Video2x crashes because it cannot handle a _.m4v_ file\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion - \r\n\r\nI have only looked at the source, and not run any debugging or tried any fixes. The proper fix isn't any closer, but the quick fix is to rename any _.m4v_ files to _.mp4_\r\n\r\n![Screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103034655/191546228-5269d27f-62b8-4057-968c-e18be8444d56.PNG)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1253879393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"K-Haigh","id":103034655,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiQvHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103034655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh","html_url":"https://github.com/K-Haigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K-Haigh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
