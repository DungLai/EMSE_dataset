This is just FFmpeg's default behavior. There will be options for you to customize the output's parameters in the future.\r\n\r\nThere has also been a lot of discussions in the Telegram group about this lately. Eventually we came to the consensus that there should be two sets of recommended settings:\r\n\r\n- Compatible: H.264 (libx264) + AAC (libfdk_aac) + MP4\r\n- Efficient: AV1 (libsvtav1) + OPUS (libopus) + MKV\r\n\r\nAs for why not just use `-c:a copy` to simply remux the audio stream into the new file, the source audio stream's format may not be supported in the new output container format. I think moving onward, there will be a default setting that uses an efficient codec + decent bitrate to re-encode the stream to make sure it won't break. There will also be an option to `-c:a copy` if the user knows that he/she's doing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1060078012/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1060162371","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/608#issuecomment-1060162371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/608","id":1060162371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc4_MMtD","user":{"login":"Cat-Lady","id":6075406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6075406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady","html_url":"https://github.com/Cat-Lady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cat-Lady/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T03:54:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T03:55:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank, you, this sounds sensible.
