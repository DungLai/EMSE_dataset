It's not just the [fallback](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/n4.4.1/libavfilter/vf_scale.c#L385) matrix, it really is the [only](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/n4.4.1/libswscale/utils.c#L1215L1217) one supported (funnily enough they even [dropped](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/37f4aa133d0a0daa04661f65a016451525df7d0f) a FIXME that should have kind of reminded this.. sigh). \r\n\r\nThis isn't incorrect per se, these conversions are still ([at](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/3345) [least](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/4805) [more](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7978) [or](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/6694) [less](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/1582)) all according to the spec. But you have no \"tag\" anymore in the final file to inform the video player on the right details, requiring it to take a blind guess. \r\nAnd so they follow an old ass [broadcast](https://books.google.com/books?id=Sa-cEY_ZeEQC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=atsc+bt709&source=bl&ots=uQW_v48xxM&sig=ACfU3U1HeRcIodEkSWCZhQJ-SG4Bp0Z52g) [convention](https://books.google.com/books?id=t-ICCW4J80UC&pg=PA604&lpg=PA604&dq=mpeg2+bt709&source=bl&ots=4qA_1wC03p&sig=ACfU3U3LCu6ValvcU3hHbtxj6eJ0UHNAjQ), whereas if you classify above a certain arbitrary \"HD\" resolution you are rendered with bt.709, otherwise you are assumed to have been mastered with bt601. \r\n\r\nThis is also why your second case gets screwed too: regardless of what the thing was previously, being FHD with no color information attached it will always be read as bt709. Smpte170m is just an useless waste of CPU cycles to the same rec.601 color space which players still won't be aware of - meanwhile bt709 is finally matching the implicit expectations. \r\n\r\nMost people here are doing something like this later scenario (you would need very small source resolutions not to surpass SD dimensions after even the tiniest 2x scaling), so I'm quite astonished it wasn't noticed earlier. \r\n\r\nWhat I found out to work:\r\n* adding `scale=out_color_matrix=bt709` to vf as already said above (note that some people argue [other](https://medium.com/invideo-io/talking-about-colorspaces-and-ffmpeg-f6d0b037cc2f) [parameters](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/395345-ffmpeg-yuv-colorspace-is-BT-601-or-BT-709#post2567990) are needed for best precision)\r\n* [using](https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/19944/ffmpeg-bmp-to-yuv-x264-color-shift#comment38936_19944) `libx264rgb` as vcodec (final file size is awfully high though)\r\n* Playing with [`in_color_matrix=bt709`](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/396362-ffplay-playback-BT-709-yuv) so as to \"overcompensate\" for whatever playback may reserve later\r\n\r\nBut all of these are a chore in their own right, if not any just to think. \r\nWhat fixes everything easily and plainly 100% of times now that we understood the issue, is simply setting `'-bsf:v': 'h264_metadata=matrix_coefficients=6'` into the assemble_video output_options. \r\nMaybe image extraction to some YUV lossless format could also do the trick (whatever the latest hip JPEG flavour, or TIFF?) but I didn't try. \r\n\r\np.s. on top of all of this, take also note there is https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan/issues/16","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1012683319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mirh","id":9366725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjY3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9366725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh","html_url":"https://github.com/mirh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1012816247","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/403#issuecomment-1012816247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/403","id":1012816247,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc48Xll3","user":{"login":"ValZapod","id":31514790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTE0Nzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31514790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod","html_url":"https://github.com/ValZapod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ValZapod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-14T06:44:27Z","updated_at":"2022-01-14T06:48:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> [There](https://github.com/felx/ffmbc/issues/114#issuecomment-213794071)'s [just](https://ffmpeg-user.ffmpeg.narkive.com/kyjUT8Ox/rgb-yuv-color-shift) [one](https://ffmpeg-user.ffmpeg.narkive.com/GWQG61UD/ffmpeg-introduces-color-shift-to-dnxhd-movs) [problem](https://lists.libav.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2010-February/024095.html): every time\r\n\r\nThat is not a problem.

It is RGBA, so 64 bit. What does it mean why? Because that is the only thing png supports. It does not support 30 bit (10*3), that is only AVIF, and anyway because it is only RGB, it cannot preserve original YCbCr data, that is only AVIF.
