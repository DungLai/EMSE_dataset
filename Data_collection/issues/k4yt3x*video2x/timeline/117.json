think in all steps of the process you will want to verify the component parts are maintaining that bit depth. ie: The video-to-frames stage that involves ffmpeg, ensure ffmpeg is writing out frames at 10 bits or higher and maintaining the same color you expect. waifu2x you'll definitely want to adjust for. Specifically the json file has an `output_depth` option that is defaulted to 8bit and needs adjusted. Then the frame-to-video stage, ensure it is outputting a 10bit or higher color depth from the source frames. I'm not familiar with ffmpeg enough unfortunately to know if it is smart enough to see the higher color depth and maintain it in the task at hand so there may be extra options needed to be added every step of the way. One of those is likely the `yuv422p` option @sat3ll mentioned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/508145189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cr08","id":1199481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08","html_url":"https://github.com/cr08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2458006538,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1ODAwNjUzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/2458006538","actor":{"login":"sat3ll","id":37741639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQxNjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37741639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll","html_url":"https://github.com/sat3ll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-03T15:35:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2458006540,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTgwMDY1NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/2458006540","actor":{"login":"sat3ll","id":37741639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQxNjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37741639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll","html_url":"https://github.com/sat3ll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sat3ll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-03T15:35:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/508580311","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/117#issuecomment-508580311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/117","id":508580311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU4MDMxMQ==","user":{"login":"JohnTravolski","id":36255053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36255053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnTravolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnTravolski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T21:36:22Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T10:29:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Upon further inspection, it seems to be a problem with ffmpeg.
