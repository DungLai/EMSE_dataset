With that said, if you're upscaling real-life videos, RealSR will give you better results anyways.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/784993145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/785000843","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/463#issuecomment-785000843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/463","id":785000843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTAwMDg0Mw==","user":{"login":"timsu92","id":33785401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzg1NDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33785401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92","html_url":"https://github.com/timsu92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsu92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-24T11:10:40Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T11:10:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hmm... things often get strange in computer world...\r\n\r\nNow, I'm using RealSR ncnn Vulkan, and here are some info about it.
