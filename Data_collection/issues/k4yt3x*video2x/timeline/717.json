I didn't even get to run the exe before my antivirus deleted it and restarted to disinfect. So I hope I have no need to re-install as I do not wish to lose my data. I performed 2 scans, 1 quick scan of critical system files and then a full scan. None of which found any viruses... So hopefully my not running the EXE (as I did find it a bit sketchy) prevented me from getting infected...\r\n\r\nI waited a while before trying to download again, but this time I went to the releases page and found the latest version and downloaded it there which had a zipped file with the proper files and my AV didn't flag it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1249993520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Adzeiros","id":87957267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTU3MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87957267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros","html_url":"https://github.com/Adzeiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adzeiros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1250010863","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/717#issuecomment-1250010863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/717","id":1250010863,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc5Kgabv","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-17T06:20:16Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T06:20:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Fortunately the AV seems to have done its job.
