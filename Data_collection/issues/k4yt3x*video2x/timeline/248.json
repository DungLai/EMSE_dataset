you don't know how to FFprobe a video, I just pushed a new commit with a new feature.\r\nYou can download the latest nightly build, which will have a \"Tools\" tab. Go in there and drag the video into the text box. It will show the FFprobe info for the video.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/627689243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/627706663","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/248#issuecomment-627706663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/248","id":627706663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzcwNjY2Mw==","user":{"login":"andyhines","id":7064299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjQyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7064299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines","html_url":"https://github.com/andyhines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-13T02:28:26Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T02:28:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"oh, that's fantastic!
