I was thinking is if --> Input =/= Output (file type) follow path and get directory items as list, parse the end of the path and look for a name match in directory (File.Type), then output that type if found, else output a message to the user at least telling them for this specific situation what's wrong. Not a big deal anymore, but it's a feature haha.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/479746582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AltWhite","id":47045740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDQ1NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47045740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite","html_url":"https://github.com/AltWhite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AltWhite/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/479749254","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/73#issuecomment-479749254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/73","id":479749254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTc0OTI1NA==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T04:52:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T04:52:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> parse the end of the path and look for a name match in directory (File.Type), then output that type if found\r\n\r\nSorry I'm kinda confused.
