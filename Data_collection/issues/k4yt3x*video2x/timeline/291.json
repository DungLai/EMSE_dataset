as it is working now, I have a question. Why waifu2x_ncnn_vulkan's tile-size need to be at least 32? Since version 20200530, I think that it uses \"0\" as default and automatically defines it based on the gpu. Even if I try to set \"0\" in video2x.yam, and then make it read-only, video2x will set the tile-size to 32. So what is the better tile-size for my 1060 6GB? Since I'm not sure how exactly it correlates with vram and I want it to use everything it can to go as fast as possible\r\n\r\nAlso, I have 2 suggestions:\r\n• I think it would be nice if video2x could show a preview of the upscale, using a frame from the video. Therefore, it would be possible to see the difference in quality and time between drivers and automatically test the ideal noise, model, filter, etc. \r\n\r\n• If the \"preserve frames\" feature could be used to upscale the same video more times, without having to extract everything again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/641628234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HenDGS","id":27168630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTY4NjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27168630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS","html_url":"https://github.com/HenDGS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenDGS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/641730513","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/291#issuecomment-641730513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/291","id":641730513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTczMDUxMw==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T05:27:36Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T05:27:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> I think it would be nice if video2x could show a preview of the upscale, using a frame from the video.
