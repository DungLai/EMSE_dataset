I also read that that folder in particular gets deleted whenever the upscaling process fails or crashes. Is this true? \r\n\r\nIs it also possible for me to make a copy of that folder and in the event that the folder does get deleted, I could simply replace it and upscale it again through Video2X GUI essentially skipping the process of creating the frames?
