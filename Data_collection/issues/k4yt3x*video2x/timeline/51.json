be fair, and this is just additional technical info on the topic, it does look like the default jpg output in ffmpeg without specifying a quality rate is pretty poor not only from your test images but a brief test of my own. Selecting the jpg output quality is done using the same `-q` or `-qscale` modifiers like other codecs. Looks like it ranges from 2-32 for jpeg with 2 being the best and 32 being the worst. Not setting it, looks like with my test samples it was defaulting to about 24-25. Setting to 1 (before I found that it MAY be limited to a max of 2 for jpeg, but doesn't seem to make much difference) seems to produce VERY minor artifacting at best which takes zooming in past 100% to identify. YMMV however.\r\n\r\nSample size of 750 720x576 frames. Current PNG output is 390MB, JPEG at `-q 1` is 35.3MB. So there IS a significant size difference at minimal quality loss.\r\n\r\nWith that said this is where my opinion and bias on this request comes in: JPEG is lossy and PNG is lossless. When dealing with the numerous conversion stages here (source video > png/jpg/etc frames > waifu2x processing and encoding to another set of png/jpg/etc frames > h264) especially with the focus of improving the quality of the source content, I would never trust a lossy intermediate format like jpg no matter how good of quality you can get it to produce. Disk space is cheap and for your average ~24 minute SD episode (again, based off my current working set of content at 720x576 source resolution, being processed up to 1440x1080) it should only be producing around ~130-150GB of frames both source and output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/475384226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cr08","id":1199481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08","html_url":"https://github.com/cr08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/475386369","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/51#issuecomment-475386369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/51","id":475386369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTM4NjM2OQ==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T20:18:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T20:18:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@cr08
