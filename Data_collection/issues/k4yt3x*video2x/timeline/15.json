@wuast94, thanks for opening a new issue. I already have the new version with multithreading ready last night. However, due to the GitHub outage (at least at my area), I wasn't able to interact with GitHub.\r\n\r\nI have edited your issue, and here are the changes:\r\n\r\n>1. try to make waifu2x going to make multible pictures at once and not one by one.\r\nhttps://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/issues/11#issuecomment-431707841\r\n\r\nThis statement is misleading. `video2x` is already telling waifu2x to process an entire folder of images at once. Unless there's something else that you mean, this has already been resolved in #11.\r\n\r\n>1. Add a feature for adding folder within multiple files. \r\nhttps://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/issues/11#issuecomment-431706764\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea, but that's not under the topic of adding mutithreading. Each feature should be in their own issue. Therefore, if you want that enhancement, please go ahead and open up a new issue. Thank you for your participation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/431921709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1918183826,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkxODE4MzgyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/1918183826","actor":{"login":"wuast94","id":16965460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16965460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94","html_url":"https://github.com/wuast94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-22T18:16:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1918183828,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MTgxODM4Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/1918183828","actor":{"login":"wuast94","id":16965460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16965460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94","html_url":"https://github.com/wuast94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-22T18:16:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/431948290","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/15#issuecomment-431948290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/15","id":431948290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTk0ODI5MA==","user":{"login":"wuast94","id":16965460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16965460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94","html_url":"https://github.com/wuast94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuast94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-22T19:26:11Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T19:26:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i
