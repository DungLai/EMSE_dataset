In my case, my input video was yuv420p which the figure above says has 12 bits per color channel (if I am interpreting what \"bits_per_pixel\" means correctly).  So I would like to have at least 12 bits per color channel in the waifu2x conversion step.  Using png files, I think I only have the choice of 8 or 16 bits.  In the step of executing waifu2x from within video2x, the outputs from waifu2x are png files having 8 bits per color channel by default.  Setting the `output_depth` to 16 should have switched the png files that video2x produces from the waifu2x step to 16 bits per color channel, but they stayed the default value of 8.  I have tested the standalone waifu2x program on using the `-d `(`-output_depth`) flag and it correctly switches the png files it produces to 16 bits per color channel.  So I am assuming that there is a disconnect in how the  `output_depth`  parameter in the video2x json file is passed to waifu2x.  That being said, the 16 bit per color channel files created are almost 6 times larger than the comparable 8 bit per color channel files, so having enough storage space for a concern.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/520383470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sjscotti","id":44651388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjUxMzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44651388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti","html_url":"https://github.com/sjscotti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjscotti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/521457533","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/135#issuecomment-521457533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/135","id":521457533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTQ1NzUzMw==","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T23:32:44Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T23:32:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Just to let you know, is issue is acknowledged and investigation is in progress.
