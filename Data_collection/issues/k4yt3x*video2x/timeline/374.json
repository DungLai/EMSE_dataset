encoding, to this date, is still \"worse\" than software encoding in general. Given the same bitrate, NVENC will have significantly more artifacts than software encoding, especially on older GPUs. Therefore, NVENC is not, and will not be the default in the foreseeable future. Given that the goal of this software is to enhance video quality, I will not suggest anyone to use hardware encoding either.\r\n\r\nRight now, if you really want to use hardware encoding, you'll have to tune the settings manually. I will consider adding NVENC support for the GUI later, but it will not be a priority.\r\n\r\nThe design of the GUI also has to be reconsidered. The new options will merge into the existing options, instead of sitting a completely new group. Take `-vcodec` for example, it's a duplicating option. This option overlaps with the `-vcodec` option above, and is only triggered if CUDA hardware acceleration is checked. Instead of doing this, the more elegant way, in my opinion, will be to set a hook on the `-vcodec` LineEdit, and update the content of the ComboBox dynamically according to the options available to that codec. Vice versa for the rest of the options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/702585489/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3832813588,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzgzMjgxMzU4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3832813588","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-02T07:58:25Z","rename":{"from":"Support
