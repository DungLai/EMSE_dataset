Based on how I am reading the documentation it is only necessary if there is a possibility of that map not existing so the command doesn't outright fail, it just ignores that map.\r\n\r\n`-map 0:v:0?`\r\n^ We know the input video track is going to exist there from the no_audio.mp4 file\r\n\r\n`-map 1?`\r\n^ We know the source input file should still exist at this stage and the map is just saying to grab everything regardless of track type. The only POTENTIAL issue I could see is if someone deletes the input file mid-way through running the script but I don't know why they would?\r\n\r\n`-map -1:v?`\r\n^ Much like the last map, the original source file we know should have a video track that needs to be cancelled out. \r\n\r\nWith that all said there's nothing harmful leaving the question marks in there, just extraneous characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/469272641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cr08","id":1199481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08","html_url":"https://github.com/cr08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/469294519","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/45#issuecomment-469294519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/45","id":469294519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI5NDUxOQ==","user":{"login":"cr08","id":1199481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08","html_url":"https://github.com/cr08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cr08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T15:29:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T15:29:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"And
