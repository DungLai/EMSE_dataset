supports native multi-threading. What Video2X implements is multi-processing.\r\n\r\nWhen you use multiple \"processes\" in *-ncnn-vulkan, Video2X will still create the empty folders and stuff just because I didn't want to write extra code just to exclude this harmless behavior. Video2X will simply extract all frames to v2x's root temp directory and pass `-j` (I think), to *-ncnn-vulkan so it will do native multi-threading instead of multi-processing.
