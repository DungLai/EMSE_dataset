went through the video, for future references, below is a conclusion.\r\n\r\n> Turing HVENC and some other new-generation HVENC h264 encoding yields better Netflix/vmaf scoring than x264 encoding on medium profile, while being hardware-accelerated so potentially much faster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few problems with making this the default option in Video2X:\r\n\r\n1. Video2X is an upscaling software, and it cares the most about quality, not speed.\r\n1. Upscaling takes way longer than encoding, sometimes tens of hours to finish. Encoding might only take 10 minutes, which is nothing when compared to the amount of time needed for upscaling.\r\n1. Video2X will very likely switch to the `slow` or `veryslow` profile in the future to guarantee maximum quality. libx264 with these profiles might yield better quality than Turing HVENC.\r\n1. x264 encoding is widely adopted, so it won't be facing any compatibility issues.\r\n1. x264 videos require a lower bitrate to achieve the same level of quality than that of a HVENC video. This means x264 videos will be smaller. In my tests, half the size of a HVENC (h264) video.\r\n1. Detection algorithms add another layer of unnecessary complexity to Video2X.\r\n1. For normal users, it's better for the default option to be the most compatible with decent quality. For experts, switching to NVENC is always an option through GUI or the config file. You may always change the default encoder in the config file and make, say, `h264_hvenc` the default.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21986859/82729620-840cd280-9ce8-11ea-983c-0ecaede74f90.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/633031955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3366950995,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM2Njk1MDk5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/events/3366950995","actor":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-23T11:30:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
