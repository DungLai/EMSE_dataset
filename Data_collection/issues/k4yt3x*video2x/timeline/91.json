a bit brief, but here's some notes that I think should give you an idea how dandere2x works now. Let me know if anything is unclear \r\n\r\n# Abstract\r\n\r\nThis is a condensed set of notes expressing how dandere2x can keep the number of images written on a disk to a minimum. \r\n\r\n*Credit to Tremex for conceptualizing/developing this.*\r\n\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\n\r\n## Progressive Frame Extractor\r\n\r\nCode: https://github.com/aka-katto/dandere2x/blob/master/src/wrappers/ffmpeg/progressive_frame_extractor_ffmpeg.py\r\n\r\nThis feature works primarily through creating an FFmpeg subprocess, then using the psutil library to suspend the subprocess as needed, and un-freezing the process when more frames are needed. \r\n\r\n### Usages in d2x:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        for x in range(1, self.frame_count - self.context.max_frames_ahead + 1):\r\n            logger.info(\"on frame x: \" + str(x))\r\n            # wait for signal to get ahead of MinDiskUsage\r\n            while x >= self.context.signal_merged_count:\r\n                time.sleep(.00001)\r\n\r\n            # when it does get ahead, extract the next frame\r\n            self.progressive_frame_extractor.next_frame()\r\n            self.__delete_used_files(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Image Piping\r\n\r\nCode: https://github.com/aka-katto/dandere2x/blob/master/src/wrappers/ffmpeg/pipe.py\r\n\r\nffmpeg yaml:\r\n```\r\n  pipe_video:\r\n    -y: true\r\n    output_options:\r\n      -loglevel: panic\r\n      -y: -f\r\n      image2pipe: True\r\n      -i: '-'\r\n      -vcodec: libx264\r\n      -preset: medium\r\n      -qscale: 5\r\n      -crf: 17\r\n      -vf:\r\n        - ' pp=hb/vb/dr/fq|32, deband=range=22:blur=false'\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelevant Resource: http://zulko.github.io/blog/2013/09/27/read-and-write-video-frames-in-python-using-ffmpeg/\r\n\r\nImages are directly piped into ffmpeg, where it begins to get processed immediately (i assume), rather than after the upscale process is completed. I'm not sure exactly where the images are saved to when buffered in, but it seems to eliminate the need for having all N files saved to disk to create the video since once an image is piped, it can be deleted.\r\n\r\n### Usage Sudo Code:\r\n```\r\npipe = Pipe(....)\r\npipe.start_pipe_thread()\r\n\r\nImage = Image( # load image )\r\n\r\npipe.save(image) # image is now saved into pipe\r\n\r\npipe.wait_finish_stop_pipe() # close pipe out\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Current Issues\r\n\r\n- If dandere2x finishes before progressive_frame_extractor is called, a suspending ffmpeg.exe will run in the background. This can easily be fixed by manually killing the subprocess on exit.\r\n\r\n- Piping uses a lot of ram, tremex noted that vp9 uses significantly less than h264, but I've left 264 to be the default due to uniformity.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/568309198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akai-katto","id":28079088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDc5MDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28079088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto","html_url":"https://github.com/akai-katto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akai-katto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/comments/1034520191","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/91#issuecomment-1034520191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/91","id":1034520191,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1EkMc49qYZ_","user":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-10T05:48:09Z","updated_at":"2022-02-10T05:48:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Implemented
