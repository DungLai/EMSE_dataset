The result is image size (20000x20000px) exceeds limit.\r\n\r\nI'm posting this as a bug because it was triggered by the output size, not the input size, which makes the error message a bit confusing and such error probably should not be triggered in this case (since it's the output which would no way be a decompression bomb).\r\n\r\n===\r\n_(The following is more of a feature request related to this issue, if this issue isn't actually a bug.)_\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any option to increase the limit (and I have no idea if it's a hard limit by _Waifu 2X Caffe_ driver, or FFMPEG), but such option (or capability) should exist, in my opinion, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. When preparing for high resolution (600ppi or higher) printing on large physical size, the limit of 179MP might be surpassed. As far as I know, currently one practical example is those full body waifu pillows, which are both large in physical size and are printed at high resolution. (Kinda a weird example but the point is this limit isn't that hard to reach.)\r\n\r\n2. Some people might use AI supersampling as a way to achieve \"lossless\" (in detail resolution) anti-aliasing, and with an image size limit being in place it limits the possibility to do so on larger images or at higher AA multipliers. \r\n\r\n## Error Log\r\n\r\n[video2x_error.log](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/files/6054685/video2x_error.log)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
