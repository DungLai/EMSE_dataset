Also a Completed, Failed, or Stopped Status should also be displayed.\r\n\r\nThis would be great for a few reasons. \r\n1. The stats can be used to help people get a better feel for how certain setting effects total time as well as how long a video will take to convert before they start the conversion. \r\n2. People that are having issues can use it to help them debug what settings might be causing them issues\r\n3. Stats are fun to look at\r\n\r\nBonus points if you can make a custom note column that the user can type in there own thoughts on a video conversion. Like these settings work really well, these settings don't looks as good, these settings cause artifacting, etc. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
