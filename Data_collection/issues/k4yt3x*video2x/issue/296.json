Therefore, it would be possible to see the difference in quality and time between drivers and automatically test the ideal settings.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a benchmark mode between drivers using user-defined settings, to see an eta of each one (based on video's framerate x duration x time to upscale 1 frame) and have an example of the quality with some images. After, there could be a test within a specific driver, to test the differences between settings, such as noise, model, filter, etc. It would be much better than having to extract a frame and manually test driver by driver to get an idea of the final result.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
