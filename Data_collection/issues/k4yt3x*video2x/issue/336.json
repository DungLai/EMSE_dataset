However there is no option as far as I can tell to stop video2x from attempting to encode and do stream merging, I have just been setting ffmpeg to mux instead of encode but its still a lot of unnecessary IO and I get constant errors with the stream merging stages resulting in the inability to batch process things.\r\n\r\nIs there a way or could you make it possible to only output the \"intermediate.mkv\" file to the output directory and stop there?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
