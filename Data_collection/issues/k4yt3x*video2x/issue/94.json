For example on my VM I am working with videos with two audio tracks whilst a separate set of videos currently running on my laptop are single audio track videos. Both cases it seems to be ignoring everything and potentially converting a single (primary) audio track instead. If memory serves ffmpeg defaults to Vorbis audio if no codec is selected which is what is happening here. Here's some mediainfo screenshots. First is the original source and second is the final file after video2x is finished. The video track seems to be fine in the end.\r\n\r\n![orig_video2x_mux](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1199481/57696938-0d8ebc80-7620-11e9-8c99-35724bce921f.PNG)\r\n![output_video2x_mux](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1199481/57696948-13849d80-7620-11e9-9a2b-34ae0d37d08f.PNG)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
