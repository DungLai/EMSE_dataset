I typically only give this partition 100gb. I changed the cache directory in video2x.yaml to:\r\n`video2x_cache_directory: \"~/.tmp/video2x\"`\r\nbut it does not respect the \"~\" as /home/-user-, so I change it to\r\n`video2x_cache_directory: \"/home/-user-/.tmp/video2x\" `\r\ndoes not like that either because it can't create the video2x directory in the /home directory. If I create the \"/home/-user-/.tmp/video2x\" directory with permissions it works for a bit but since it removes the video2x directory on completion it fails on next go. I've tried this multiple times and I think I included the right log. The output driver selected doesn't matter\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\n[video2x_8eoriaok.log](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/files/5905977/video2x_8eoriaok.log)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
