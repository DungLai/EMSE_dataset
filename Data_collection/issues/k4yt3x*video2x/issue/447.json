I looked, but didn't see any version numbers.\r\n\r\n## Symptom\r\n\r\nI followed the \"Run from Source Code\" direction in the docs. I followed the instructions installing the Python dependencies, FFmpeg, and waifu2x-converter-cpp. The next direction said to \"Update the configuration file and replace the driver's path with the path of the driver you've just installed.\" So I did `which ffmpeg` and changed the path parameter in `video2x.yaml` to `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`. I did the same for waifu2x-converter-cpp.\r\n\r\nFor some reason though it doesn't work. It says that I put the incorrect path, despite the fact that (as far as I know) this is the correct path.  Paths I have tried include `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`, `/bin/ffmpeg`, `/usr/bin/ffprobe`, `/bin/ffprobe`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe`.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n```bash\r\n2021-01-17 23:36:29.035054 [+] INFO: Input path(s): /home/apersonwholikespasta/Videos/Candy_Boy/360p\r\n2021-01-17 23:36:29.038555 [+] INFO: File MIME type: video/mp4\r\n2021-01-17 23:36:29.040634 [+] INFO: File MIME type: video/mp4\r\n2021-01-17 23:36:29.044479 [+] INFO: File MIME type: video/mp4\r\n2021-01-17 23:36:29.046544 [+] INFO: File MIME type: video/mp4\r\n[!] ERROR: FFmpeg or FFprobe cannot be found under the specified path\r\n[!] ERROR: Please check the configuration file settings\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/apersonwholikespasta/.local/share/video2x_4.8.1/video2x/src/video2x_gui.py\", line 105, in run\r\n    self.fn(*self.args, **self.kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/apersonwholikespasta/.local/share/video2x_4.8.1/video2x/src/upscaler.py\", line 633, in run\r\n    self._check_arguments()\r\n  File \"/home/apersonwholikespasta/.local/share/video2x_4.8.1/video2x/src/upscaler.py\", line 281, in _check_arguments\r\n    raise FileNotFoundError(self.ffmpeg_settings[\"ffmpeg_path\"])\r\nFileNotFoundError: /usr/bin/ffmpeg\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"APersonWhoLikesPasta","id":35317682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzE3Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35317682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta","html_url":"https://github.com/APersonWhoLikesPasta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/APersonWhoLikesPasta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
