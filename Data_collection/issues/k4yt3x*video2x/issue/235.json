The upscaling seems to finish and the cpu intensive conversion portion which I assume is simply re merging the upscaled  images fails. On all my tests it seems to get roughly 2000 frames into this process before suddenly making my entire computer die. \r\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is the computer is still on but all the monitors lose signal and hard reboot is necessary. I'm guessing this is gpu related but it's strange because it happens during the second cpu intensive portion. Also since the last step is relatively quick 5 -10 mins usually I figured maybe it's just that the gpu died and wont display to the monitors but the program is still working in the background. So I waited 15 - 20 mins to ensure if it was still working in the background than that would be enough time to finish the video. But on reboot it seems the video was not created. \r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that my testing using the same settings on a 2 second video works without issue. The issue only occurs with longer videos. I've had it happen on 3 different videos around 3, 4, and 5 mins respectively. \r\n\r\nMy drivers are fully up to date. I'm using a gtx 1070, windows 10. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgcampea","id":59268455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjY4NDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59268455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea","html_url":"https://github.com/dgcampea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgcampea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
