Using  \"-r 3\" or higher alway results in errors. But I was working to use the  \"-r 2\" twice in a row to get a higher resolution. \r\n\r\nChosing a custum resuliution only works if is was the same as in \"-r 2\". Using \"--width=1920 --height=1080\" on a 640x480 video failed on all tested systems.
