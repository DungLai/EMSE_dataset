The temp images that were being created were correctly upscaled, but the final mp4 was empty for some reason.\r\nI cloned the repository yesterday, GUI version is 2.5.0\r\n\r\nEdit: I noticed that an mkv file was created too, slipped my eye. However, there isn't any audio in this file and it is occupying 720MB, 8 times bigger than the original 90 MB.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: It's missing the subtitles too.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots or Error Messages\r\n\r\nPlease paste screenshots or error messages here.\r\nInclude as much details as you can, as this greatly helps debugging the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease paste your error message in the code block down below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
