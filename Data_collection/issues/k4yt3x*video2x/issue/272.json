I have queued files in the GUI by selecting them manually and then output to a folder. I have a separate SSD that stores my cache directory as I do not want to wear out my boot drive if I am running batch operations. I have done some testing with running as admin and waiting for the entire batch to finish but the cache files are never removed.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31021545/82859586-28f3ff00-9ee5-11ea-9d2e-2d0c0b9e814e.png)\r\nLooks Normal in the GUI\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31021545/82859748-8ee08680-9ee5-11ea-976a-e1d5dd69ed29.png)\r\nTemp files from previously completed episodes still in cache folder.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge there is no console output for trying to remove files but I could have missed it if it is right before the upscaling starts. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sparkpedia","id":31021545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDIxNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31021545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sparkpedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkpedia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
