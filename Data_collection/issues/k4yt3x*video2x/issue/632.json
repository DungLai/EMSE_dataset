Folks,\r\nI've noticed an issue when trying to run an interpolation job, the code seems to get stuck in this loop, specifically in lines 151-154.\r\n\r\nWhat I see is the job process normally, the decoder queue empties and the decoder thread stops, then we get stuck with supposedly two remaining tasks to complete, but the requested frame_index is None, so we end up in a loop.\r\n\r\nI don't quite understand the logic around the interpolation yet, but I was wondering if the calculation of total tasks at the start of the run might be off, if the decision engine decides not to process a frame or two and we end up with a situation where the total job length extends past the number of actual frames to process?\r\n\r\nThe behavior seems to be the same regardless of the input file, I've made a couple small ones for testing.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nEDIT: Launch args:   `python -m video2x -i ../1min_sample.mkv -o ../int_test.mkv interpolate`","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
