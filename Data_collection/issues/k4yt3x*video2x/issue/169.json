(Kernel reuse will accelerate processing greatly.)\r\n\r\nThis can be found here [https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K/blob/master/Java_Instructions.md](url). With a small change to the Main.java file to accept an array of images instead of a single image and thereby not recalling and re-creating the kernel each time you could see a massive speedup. Anime4k was never meant to be used for one image at a time the JAVA program just makes it seem that way. Thought that this might be helpful.","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
