It worked well for a couple days, but now I always get this error when the program finishes compiling the video back from the upscaled frames. Sometimes it even causes my computer to blue-screen. Since it began throwing this error I have not been able to get it to work on any driver(algorithm) for any video file. Single images are still bale to be upscaled just fine. The error seems to be related to an attempt to access unregistered memory, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nCore i7-6700k - 4.6GHz OC\r\n16 GB DDR4 -2666Mhz\r\nNvidia RTX 3070ti\r\n\r\nI'm running up-to-date Windows 10 21H1 19043.1586, the latest Nvidia GeForce drivers with CUDA and CuDNN, and python 3.7.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
