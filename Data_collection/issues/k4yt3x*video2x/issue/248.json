Is this intended? I was thinking this could possibly be due to some sort of de-interlacing or something similar but I am uncertain and haven't been able to find any indication of an fps setting in the ffmpeg config section. Looking through the wiki I saw example screenshots of 23.9fps input resulting in 23.9fps output (so not doubling it), so it may be specific to the input file selected. I didn't notice at first until I went to run anime4kcpp on files i had processed with waifu2x-caffe and noticed that they had twice the number of frames. Possibly as a result, I haven't been able to get anime4k to successfully run on an waifu2x-caffe processed videoyet. I left it running for 8 hours, and it did not seem to be making any progress. I am trying to use a 1.5 scaling factor in anime4k, instead of a 2x, so perhaps that is somehow incompatible.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help, and this really cool software!","closed_by":{"login":"andyhines","id":7064299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjQyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7064299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines","html_url":"https://github.com/andyhines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
