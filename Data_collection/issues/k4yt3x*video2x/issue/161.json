SAR instead of DAR.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what SAR and DAR are, i wouldn't blame you.  SAR is used for old 4:3 Monitors, DAR is used for current 16:9 monitors, so that the video is displayed correctly and not stretched or squashed.\r\n\r\nExample:  A old anime that says it is 720x480, but will play it back at 853x480 so it looks correct.  You can see this in Media Player Classic when playing some old anime if you go to File>Properties and the Details tab you can see it's current resolution being played at.  \r\nCan also right click on video playback Video Frame>Aspect Ratio and change between Default (DAR) and Assume Square Pixels (SAR) to see the difference.\r\n\r\nOnly work around at the minute is to open one anime video at a time in a video editor and export it with the DAR resolution and then upscale it using Video2x.\r\n\r\nIf you can make a fix for this, it would be awesome.  Would make upscaling some of my favourite shows alot faster and less tedious.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
