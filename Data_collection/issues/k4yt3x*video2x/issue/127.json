I got the same error about can't open extracted frame.\r\nI installed the tool with video2x_setup.py. The only difference I added between each attempt is I updated my NVIDIA driver to latest version before running the 2nd attempt.\r\nI do notice however I keep running out of space of my C: drive (running the C: drive with 128 GB SSD and I'm using a whole full featured movie to test this since I don't have anything else).\r\n\r\n[Here's a Pastebin of the log](https://pastebin.com/acYgU6bm)\r\n\r\nUpdate before posting: I downloaded a 5 second 480p clip to remake to 1080p and it is working beautifully. So if I need to guess, the first two attempt failed because I am indeed running out of space.\r\nIf this isn't the issue, it would be nice to be able to change where the temp folder is, regardless :P\r\nThanks, and any help is appreciated!","closed_by":{"login":"thepinkbanana","id":53278491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjc4NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53278491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana","html_url":"https://github.com/thepinkbanana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinkbanana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
