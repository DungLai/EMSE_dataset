Component Versions\r\n\r\nPlease at least fill in the release version and GUI or CLI version.\r\n\r\n- **Video2X release version**: 4.6.0\r\n- **Upscaler version**: Caffe Latest\r\n- **GUI version**: 2.7.1\r\n- **CLI version**: NA\r\n\r\n## Symptom\r\n\r\nWhen up-scaling a long video the main python process exits with no error, with no obvious trigger.\r\nIt's also notable that longer videos seem to make it more likely to exit like this.\r\nthe driver (Caffe in this case) will continue to run. where ffmpeg can be run manually.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\nThere isn't really a specific error in regular use, it just... exits abruptly, without any exception or error.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47612589/86065598-ff774780-ba3d-11ea-9b65-bdde37d11ba5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended to include your error log.**\r\nThe logs don't show anything more than the last message in the
