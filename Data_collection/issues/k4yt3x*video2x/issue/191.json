I would like to continue it instead of restarting it, mainly because I don't want to write 600+ GB to a drive again, especially considering that it was dropped on accident once, if I don't have to. Is there any way to do that?\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding it should be as simple as letting the program know \"Hey, here is a list of images. Finish up scaling all of them, then batch them into a video file.\" Am I oversimplifying it?
