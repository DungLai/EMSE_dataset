I have an old show of about ~90 episodes I'd like to start processing with this. Some things that immediately came to mind that could probably be improved upon:\r\n\r\n1) Currently the 'demux' and 'remux' stages assume a single AAC audio track and fail if there's any other formats used and miss secondary audio tracks. Being able to dynamically work with what is in the source file would be nice, including multiple audio tracks as well as subtitle tracks. Maybe just automatically say all tracks after the video track just copy them 1:1 to the output video. Don't even need to re-encode here since that can be done after the fact pretty easily.\r\n\r\n2) There are a LOT of command line arguments being given to ffmpeg along the way as well as even waifu2x-caffe which are currently hardcoded and could be more suitable having some of them as either command line options or in the config file. Prime example is the h264 encoding stage and being able to fine tune the encoding settings. Even a one off case I'm running into is cropping black borders off at the frame extraction stage that otherwise get blown up needlessly otherwise in the end.\r\n\r\n3) Maybe choose to have options to redirect the frames and upscale folders to a different location.\r\n\r\nI may play around with these on my own but can't guarantee anything or even a timeframe. Not a developer by any means (unless you count some crusty php knowledge from 10+ years ago that barely counts as novice level. lol) but have been meaning to pick up python at some point so may give me something to toy around with.","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
