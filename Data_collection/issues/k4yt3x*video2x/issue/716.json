By the way the idea of manually editing .yaml is too inconvinient, why not add option \"Reset default settings to applied now\" somewhere at the top of the program and add presets for resolution of a video for YouTube (1080p, 2K, 4K)?\r\n\r\nThe election of the codec is a little bit raw too. As far as I understand the program supports all the codecs available in ffmpeg. But CRF option is related only to x264/x265 and must be specified in some way by the user because this is a necessary field. I think this problem is solvable by presets for this ones, additionally including intemediate codecs such as DNxHD. This would be enough for 99% of users. Others I suppose will be smart enough to edit the ffmpeg command directly for their needs, if this option will be given, the program already has ffprobe and at the same time lacks direct editing of the final ffmpeg command.\r\n\r\nAlso ffmpeg by default uses \"film\" filter, which is deleted from the latest version of ffmpeg as far as I know, I used the latest compiled for Windows version, it didn't work for me and caused troubles.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
