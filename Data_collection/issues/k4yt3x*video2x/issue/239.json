Environment Information\r\n\r\n|Module|Version|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|`Video2X`|`4.0.0 Beta1`|\r\n|`Anime4KCPP`|`1.6.0`|\r\n\r\n## Symptom\r\n\r\nIf GPU Mode is enabled, it will get an error of `Read kernel error`\r\n\r\n## Reason\r\nIf enabled the GPU Mode, Anime4KCPP will try to read the kernel file `Anime4KCPPKernel.cl` in the current working directory, which is `./Anime4KCPPKernel.cl`, this is for the convenience of debugging.  \r\nI will integrate the kernel file to the cpp source at the proper moment, but now you may need to copy this file to the current  working directory of V2X.  \r\n\r\nBTW, `--preProcessing` and `--postProcessing` has been replaced by  `--preprocessing` and `--postprocessing` in the newest release of Anime4KCPP
