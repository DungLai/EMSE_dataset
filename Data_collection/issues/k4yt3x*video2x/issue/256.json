I ran the GUI version with all values default but got an error, then I tried it in the CLI version without success either. Ended up learning here that I was out of memory, and then changed to waifu2x converter cpp and it worked.\r\n2. The upscale succeeded, but the output had no image, only sound. Then I found a suggestion in another report and changed the FFmpeg's `pixel format` to ` yuv420p`, which fixed the problem.\r\n3. But now although the output has initially the aimed quality, it rapidly reduces, and every 122th frame has an even lower quality, which visibly flashes the video.\r\n\r\nI tried messing with the values of `processes` and `preserve frames`, with no effect, and my poor knowledge didn't give me confidence to explore other settings.\r\n\r\nUsing GTX 750 and i5-3330 (it's weak, I know.....)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots or Error Messages\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n[imgur.com/a/jBNIH9O](https://imgur.com/a/jBNIH9O)\r\n\r\nSamples:\r\n[imgur.com/a/iE2QLio](https://imgur.com/a/iE2QLio)\r\n\r\nNo error messages.","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
