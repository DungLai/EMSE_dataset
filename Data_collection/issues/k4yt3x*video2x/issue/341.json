The only thing that requires 3.8 support is the actual use of the walrus operator a few times in video2x_gui.py. While I'm all for syntactic sugar, I don't think this should be an artificial hard requirement while Python 3.8 is still so relatively new, and isn't the default python3 installation on many linux / mac machines.\r\n\r\nEdit: There's also a minimal use of shlex_join in the wrapper submodule, however that can be fixed with the following simple lambda: `shlex_join = lambda split_command: ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in split_command)`\r\n\r\nEdit: at a very minimum make this known somewhere in the readme.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10525230/91490219-17bde400-e880-11ea-8c52-4b99fbb46186.png)","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
