A roughly 22-25 minute video with approx. 35k frames. One thing I ran into is that somewhere during the process where it breaks the frames out into equal folders depending on the number of upscaler threads use for whatever reason in my test left out a single frame. So essentially I had this:\r\n\r\nframes\r\n-- \\0\\\r\n-- \\1\\\r\n-- \\2\\\r\n-- \\extracted_9999.png\r\n\r\nBtw, that frame number is correct in my scenario and not just a placeholder\r\n\r\nSo with that lone frame outside those folders, after upscaling was done there was a single frame gap in the upscaled folder. It then cascaded to the following ffmpeg encode step failing at that frame number because it couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nFWIW it recommended dropping down to 3 threads which I did so not sure how related that would be here. Despite the fact it never seems to use much more than about 1GB extra tops over my normal load leaving about 7GB free still and just 1GB VRAM used on my 6GB 1060 MaxQ. Though it seemed to load the system down pretty well with the Compute load up around 85% and CPU (i7-7700HQ) regularly around 90%. Took about 2.5 hours just for the upscale portion for 35k frames.","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
