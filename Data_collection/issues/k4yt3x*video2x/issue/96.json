But exe version ignores some sort of ffmpeg setting in json config(*I've tested video2x.py works well). My command was `video2x -c video2x.json -m cudnn -i test -o output --width=1920 --height=1080` and setting file follows\r\n[video2x.txt](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/files/3194366/video2x.txt)\r\n\r\nHere's ffmpeg frames to video command-line output from setting above\r\n\r\nOutput #0, mp4, to 'E:\\program\\video2x-2.7.0-win32-full\\output\\test2.mp4':\r\n  Metadata:\r\n    major_brand     : isom\r\n    minor_version   : 512\r\n    compatible_brands: isomiso2avc1mp41\r\n    encoder         : Lavf58.26.101\r\n    Stream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (libx264) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv444p, 1920x1080, q=-1--1, 30 fps, 15360 tbn, 30 tbc (default)\r\n    Metadata:\r\n      handler_name    : VideoHandler\r\n      encoder         : Lavc58.47.106 libx264\r\n    Side data:\r\n      cpb: bitrate max/min/avg: 0/0/0 buffer size: 0 vbv_delay: -1\r\n\r\nThat shows exe definitely ignores setting, forces to use yuv444p.
