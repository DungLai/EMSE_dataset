This is the first time I am on this site. I downloaded this app last night to upscale a 2 minute, 11MB 480p video (2.5 ratio) with the driver being waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan. At first it took me 3 hrs for the first part, then it quickly devolved into more than 9 hrs. Is this supposed to be this long? My laptop is an Asus TUF gaming, 8GB ram, AMD Ryzen 5 3550H. It wasn't the best laptop, but I don't think it can't handle upscaling such a short video. Other similar apps like Waifu2x GUI runs just fine on my laptop (4 min for an image upscaling), so I though it was weird that running video2x would be this slow. My technical knowledge is very limited, so hope I can get an easy-to-understand answer (ELI5). Thanks a lot! \r\nP/s: I am typing this on my phone at 6 in the morning, so hope you guys can excuse some grammar mistakes. (Pls don't kill me for the bad screenshot). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\nPlease upload or paste the error log here.
