I have successfully started upscaling a 22 minute, 41,029 frame video, and it's jumping around from 14 hours to 22 minutes remaining. I have an i7-7700k with an EVGA RTX 2070 Super. For the first 2 minutes my GPU utilization is zero and my CPU is pegged at 100% on all cores. Then it starts processing frames and the CPU utilization drops to around 10% while the GPU is at 20%-30%. My question is, does this sound normal? I have changed the number of processes to 4 (someone please explain what that does better) and that is all. I am using the Waifu2X NCNN Vulkan Driver. I know Vulkan has something to do with graphics but that's about it. Is it normal for it to peg the CPU like that in the beginning? Is there a reason that only 20%-30% of my GPU is being utilized? Can I increase the utlization/speed of the upscale?\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: I stopped the previous run and started again with 16 processes. It took about 4 minutes to start this time and my VRAM is almost completely used versus it being about 66% previously. But now my CPU is staying pegged at 100% and my GPU is only at 2%. That doesn't seem right. However, the upscale is now taking minutes with a FPS of about 92-100. But the Frame Preview window is blank so that is worrisome.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: It's been finished for about 8 minutes and nothing is happening. It's just sitting here at 100% and the FPS are slowly dropping as is CPU usage. I have decided to go back and run with the 4 processes and let it go all night and hope it's successful in the morning. At least now the Frame Preview is working again. Also, changing the view in Task Manager to CUDA shows 0%, but if this is Vulkan maybe that's why? Anyways, changing it to compute1 shows 100% utilization, if that means anything.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3: It did complete successfully however the image quality is not as improved as I'd hoped. The source is only 480p so I am now running at 4x with 6 processes.","closed_by":{"login":"Kameechewa","id":3394096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTQwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3394096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa","html_url":"https://github.com/Kameechewa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kameechewa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
