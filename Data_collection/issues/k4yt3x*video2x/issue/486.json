Component Versions\r\n\r\nPlease at least fill in the release version and GUI or CLI version.\r\n\r\n- **Video2X release version**: 4.8.1\r\n- **Upscaler version**: RealSR NCNN Vulkan\r\n- **GUI version**: 2.8.1 (reported in top bar, shouldn't it be 4.8.1?)\r\n\r\n## Symptom\r\n\r\nJobs parameters from RealSR NCNN Vulkan do not get passed in processing thread, resulting in a default of 1:1:1 and seriously cripping performances.\r\n\r\nWhen changing \"processes\" instead, it gets changed to N:N:N, based on the number of process setted up (without the ability to setup a proper job string)\r\n\r\nThis is an error on the GUI part, since the Jobs option in RealSR is useless and the Processes option in Main tab is misleading for this.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or
