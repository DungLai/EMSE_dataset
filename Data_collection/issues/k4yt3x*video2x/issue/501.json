Description\r\n\r\nNvidia is releasing their Video Effects SDK.\r\nThe SDK includes precompiled Windows binaries of the sample applications, but they are fulyl featured.\r\nThe SDK includes the following features:\r\n\r\n### Shared Features\r\n * All the apps support a \"progress\" printout for each given input.\r\n\r\n### Denoising\r\n * Supposed to be used for webcams, but can be applied to any image or video input\r\n * Has possible values:\r\n\t* \"Weak\" denoising using a value of 0\r\n\t* \"Strong\" denoising using a value of 1\r\n\t\r\n### Artifact Reduction\r\n * Attempts to remove artifacts from low bitrate input\r\n * Includes removing things such as blocking, ringing, mosquito noise, etc.\r\n * Uses a float value from `0` to `1` in increments of `0.1`\r\n * Default value is `0.4`\r\n \r\n### Upscaler & SuperRes\r\n * Can upscale the input image/video by multiples of `4/3` (`1.3333` repeating), `1.5`, `2`, `3`, and `4`\r\n\r\nHere are the specific apps and how they operate:\r\n * `DenoiseEffectApp`: sole purpose is to denoise given inputs\r\n * `VideoEffectsApp`:\r\n\t* Can use one possible effect at a time on a given input\r\n\t\t* `Upscaler` only upscales the image - there is no denoising/artifact reduction applied\r\n\t\t* `SuperRes` upscales and allows you to apply artifact removal \r\n\t\t* `ArtifactReduction`: self explanatory\r\n\t\t* `Denoising`: self explanatory\r\n * `BatchEffectApp/BatchDenoiseEffectApp`: applies denoising to multiple images in a batch method\r\n * `BatchEffectApp/BatchEffectApp`: applies any of the filters available from `VideoEffectsApp` in a batch method.\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nRepository can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MAXINE-VFX-SDK).\r\nDocumentation is in that repository, but a direct can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MAXINE-VFX-SDK/blob/master/docs/NVIDIA%20Video%20Effects%20SDK%20Programming%20Guide.pdf).\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nThe Nvidia Maxine repository uses the MIT license,
