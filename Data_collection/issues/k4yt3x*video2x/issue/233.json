Can we explore similar functionality for Video2x to take advantage of multiple GPUs also?\r\n\r\nVideo2x itself is aware of how many images were extracted from a said video file source after extraction. Can it assign frames with even numbers to 1 GPU and odd numbers to another GPU?\r\nThe images are static and fixed in numbers and perhaps can be assigned to different folders for multiple worker instances of Video2x or multiple scaling processes? \r\n\r\nThe suggestion above is a simplistic view of the upscaling process from my layman's point of view so my apologies if it is not functionally feasible.
