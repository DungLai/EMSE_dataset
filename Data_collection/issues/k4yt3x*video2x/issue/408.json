The created file for sure is a video file.\r\nIt doesn't matter whether you are using Waifu2X NCNN Vulkan or Waifu2X Caffee as driver. \r\n\r\nThis error is **not** shown if you use an older version of video2x. I tested it with video2x-4.6.1-win32-full and it works, using Waifu2X Caffee as driver.\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\nError log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[+] INFO: Loading files into processing queue\r\n2020-11-11 14:22:49.012990 [+] INFO: Input path(s): video.mkv\r\n2020-11-11 14:22:49.013986 [+] INFO: File MIME type: inode/blockdevice\r\n[!] ERROR: File video.mkv (inode/blockdevice) neither an image nor a video\r\n[!] WARNING: Skipping this file\r\n[+] INFO: Loaded files into processing queue\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sfremerey","id":17259691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU5Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17259691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey","html_url":"https://github.com/sfremerey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfremerey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
