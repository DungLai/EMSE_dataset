I checked on it in the middle of the night and it seemed like it was working but when I checked in the morning there were multiple of the same error. I'm not really sure when it the error appeared but it happened somewhere between 50%-75% completion. Even though there was an error, it looked like it was upscalling each frames. I checked the task manager is it confirmed my suspicion, it was using 70-80% of my GPU's Cuda.\r\n\r\nVideo2x Configuration for Upscalling \r\n![Video2x Configuration for upscalling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17225364/102241877-536fce80-3eae-11eb-8346-0c0def71d202.png)\r\n\r\nSpecs: \r\nCPU: i7 9700K\r\nGPU: RTX 2070\r\nRAM: 16GB 2400MHZ\r\nMy drivers are up to date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Error Log or Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-12-15 081357](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17225364/102242699-325bad80-3eaf-11eb-84e5-88f69791c23f.png)\r\n\r\nThe video I was trying to upscale:https://mylivewallpapers.com/anime/its-gonna-rain-soon-live-wallpaper/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
