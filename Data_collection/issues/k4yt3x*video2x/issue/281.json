As of now, if I specify an input folder and only upscale half, I can't specify the same folder to upscale or the program will abort because there is already an output file with the same name (in either case, I would be upscaling a video I'd already upscaled). Would be nice if the program could save which files it's already upscaled from a folder, as well as saving the previously used output folder as the output destination.
