It could probably help reduce work on your part and be a great resource to fans of the project.\r\n\r\nObviously, If you make a discord I would recommend advertising it near the top of the main github page. \r\n\r\nI see you're already using something named telegram. I think discord is far more casual and approachable for the general audience. Plus discord doesn't require you download an app to view channels unlike telegram. The second I saw I needed to create an account and download the app for telegram I instantly rejected joining it. This wouldn't be the case with discord.\r\n\r\nThat said while writing this I decided to dig deeper into what telegram actually is and their is one thing that really stood out to me as a major benefit.  That is apparently telegram has a 1.5GB file transfer limit vs the like 8mb of discord. If that's still true I can see how telegram would be a better fit for video2x and I'll prob take the time to join it after my research. \r\n\r\nThat said a normal person wouldn't bother to write a GitHub issue and do further research into telegram the way I have. So I think making a discord would still be a great option. I would recommend making one and then creating a channel dedicated to pointing to telegram for any uploading content they want to post. This way you can probably capture a lot of people who prefer and know of discord only while simultaneously explaining to them why they should join telegram. I bet you would see numbers for both services increase if you did this.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
