I don't know if this is intended considering some other waifu2x-caffe settings (noise_level, gpu, crop_size, batch_size) seem to be passed on from the .yaml fine if changed to non-default values (unless overwritten at the command prompt when starting video2x). I inserted a '--preset' parameter for ffmpeg using the .yaml and that's pushing through fine so seeing the 'process' parameter basically ignored by waifu2x-caffe seemed odd considering the established behavior with other stuff. Unless the only intended way to change this is by using -m <cpu|gpu|cudnn> at the command prompt when initializing video2x and never through the .yaml? Doing it at the command is fine and works but I'm just wondering why this parameter specifically doesnt seem to pass through, any clarification would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots or Error Messages\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54195989/75410811-b2923180-58e2-11ea-8c7a-011dbe8096b2.png)\r\n\r\n![Untitled2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54195989/75415425-32bf9380-58f1-11ea-9219-813f54396e98.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"k4yt3x","id":21986859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg2ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21986859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x","html_url":"https://github.com/k4yt3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4yt3x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
