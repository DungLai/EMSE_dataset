I tested multiple input files and each seems to hit the same error, and I tested files that I previously had successfully used as inputs to 4.0.0b3 and they too failed, so I suspect that this is not specific to the files (or if it is it's an issue with all of my test files, that previously was handled smoothly by 4.0.0b3). I switched back to 4.0.0b3 and have successfully upscaled a file that gave this error so I don't suspect it is inherent to any recent driver changes.\r\n![v2x_error_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7064299/82229766-da4cd080-98f8-11ea-9a46-5d0d2daa248c.PNG)\r\n![v2x_error_02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7064299/82229797-dfaa1b00-98f8-11ea-8c88-11fc25ae5a63.PNG)\r\n\r\nIt looks like perhaps there was something changed in the way ffmpeg is called? The video upscaling seems to actually complete and creates a video file output with no audio and a second file (that I didn't check but I suspect contains the audio stream) in the output folder, it just then fails to combine them, and stops processing any other input files (due to the error.) It seems odd that it would create a malformed video file that it then couldn't re-integrate into the final output but perhaps I am misunderstanding the error.\r\n\r\nThank you for any advice!","closed_by":{"login":"andyhines","id":7064299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjQyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7064299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines","html_url":"https://github.com/andyhines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyhines/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/k4yt3x/video2x/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
