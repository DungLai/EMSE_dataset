However, when I tried to upscale a PNG image, the program exited normally (Processing completed successfully), but no output image file was generated.\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest container image (5.0.0-beta6), and the command to upscale is shown as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run --gpus all -it --rm -v $PWD:/host ghcr.io/k4yt3x/video2x -i input.png -o output.png -p3 upscale -h 720 -a waifu2x -n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I use another video file, the output can be generated successfully.\r\nIs it because the newest version no longer supports image files?\r\n\r\n(P.S.
