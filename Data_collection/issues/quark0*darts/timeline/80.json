If I use other code with Resnet to train from start. It only takes 1/5 time of DARTS code. Maybe the DARTS code is not so efficient?\r\n\r\nI am searching for models on my own dataset. And it turns out the same as you've noticed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/516800886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/517086169","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/80#issuecomment-517086169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/80","id":517086169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzA4NjE2OQ==","user":{"login":"zhaohui-yang","id":8347960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDc5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8347960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaohui-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaohui-yang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T01:51:54Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T01:51:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Margrate
