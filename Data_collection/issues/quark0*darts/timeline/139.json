Instead, to reduce the complexity, you can just do it linearly _i.e._ one weight update, one arch update, one weight update, one arch update and so on till convergence. This will greatly reduce the time needed. Think of this something like stochastic gradient descent where you do not go in the direction of the greatest gradient always, but when you train for a sufficient amount of time, the end result is that you reach the minima.
