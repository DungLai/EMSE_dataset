Could you explain more about why it takes up a lot of memory? For example, in my case, some configs are as follows:\r\n- image size: 224*224\r\n- #nodes in one cell: 4\r\n- layers: 6\r\nOnly when I set the batch size equal to 2, then the code can run otherwise it will throw Out of Memory error. I think the model is not large, even small.

For example, in my case, some configs are as follows:\r\n> > \r\n> > * image size: 224*224\r\n> > * #nodes in one cell: 4\r\n> > * layers: 6\r\n> >   Only when I set the batch size equal to 2, then the code can run otherwise it will throw Out of Memory error. I think the model is not large, even small.\r\n> \r\n> Similar condition.\r\n> \r\n> image size is set to (224,224) in `train_search.py`, but it still returns 'out of memory' message immediately even when I set the layers to 4 and batch size to 1.\r\n> \r\n> Runing Envs: Python 2.7, pytorch 0.3.1.post2, CUDA 9.0.\r\n> \r\n> PS. I am using a single 2080Ti with memory of few above 11GB\r\n\r\nHello @rrryan2016,\r\n\r\nThank you for your question. As for my case, I was using one V100 with 32G RAM.\r\nUnfortunately, DARTS is very space-consuming when searching for architectures. So you may like to try with the smaller batch size and block structure. Or even reduce some of the layer options, because, in the searching phase, the model is K times larger than the final model (for K stands for the number of operations for each layer).\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun:)\r\n\r\nPF","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/761966806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4216079237,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIxNjA3OTIzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/4216079237","actor":{"login":"rrryan2016","id":24492366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDkyMzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24492366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016","html_url":"https://github.com/rrryan2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-18T04:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4216079238,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMTYwNzkyMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/4216079238","actor":{"login":"rrryan2016","id":24492366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDkyMzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24492366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016","html_url":"https://github.com/rrryan2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrryan2016/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-18T04:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4216079239,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIxNjA3OTIzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/4216079239","actor":{"login":"skx6","id":32217930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjE3OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32217930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6","html_url":"https://github.com/skx6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skx6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-18T04:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4216079241,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMTYwNzkyNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/4216079241","actor":{"login":"skx6","id":32217930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjE3OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.
