I'm not the author. But I did played a bit with the codes. For your question,\r\n> How can you make sure that this target architecture yields good accuracy?  \r\n\r\nActually, the performance of the architecture can only be measured at the retrain stage. And it is pretty hard to tell if you've got a good or bad model right after searching. My suggestion is, before trying to find new models, you may run couple of classic models (i.e. VGG, ResNet, and also other SOTA models) on your dataset and use it as an baseline. If your searched model does better than your baseline, then I think it is reasonable to conclude that this model is a good one.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've noticed that your normal cell contains a lot of skip-connects. This is actually a form of \"oversearching\" that your normal cell has only a little learnable parameters. Obviously, this will lead to a bad retrain performance. To solve this problem, I recommend you to read [Progressive DARTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12760), where this paper also noticed this issue and raised a \"search space regularization\" to solve it. [They also released their code on github!](https://github.com/chenxin061/pdarts) It is very easy to get hands on for DARTS players, because the PDARTS is modified from DARTS.\r\n\r\nGL,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/508304872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2459179450,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1OTE3OTQ1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2459179450","actor":{"login":"haithanhp","id":25809722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODA5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25809722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp","html_url":"https://github.com/haithanhp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-04T01:26:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2459179451,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTkxNzk0NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2459179451","actor":{"login":"haithanhp","id":25809722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODA5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25809722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp","html_url":"https://github.com/haithanhp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-04T01:26:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/508535479","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/92#issuecomment-508535479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/92","id":508535479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODUzNTQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"haithanhp","id":25809722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODA5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25809722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp","html_url":"https://github.com/haithanhp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T16:37:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T16:37:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

For example, python visualize.py DARTS_V3.\r\n\r\nHope this can help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHai","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/512587244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"haithanhp","id":25809722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODA5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25809722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp","html_url":"https://github.com/haithanhp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haithanhp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2491004371,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ5MTAwNDM3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2491004371","actor":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T22:09:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2491004372,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0OTEwMDQzNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2491004372","actor":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T22:09:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/512610105","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/92#issuecomment-512610105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/92","id":512610105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjYxMDEwNQ==","user":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T23:49:13Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T23:49:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @HaiPhan1991,\r\nThanks a lot.
