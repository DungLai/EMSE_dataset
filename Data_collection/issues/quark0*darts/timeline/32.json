We repeated the search for 4 times to find the best resulting cell based on the validation curves in Figure 3, and then evaluated that single best cell also for 4 times to obtain it's mean and average.\r\n> 2. Zeros are auxiliary ops that allow different edges to have different total strengths. Their absolute strengths do not matter, because multiplying all edges in the cell by the same factor does not really affect it's topology. Note that in this work we are not trying to learn the sparsity of the architecture at all, as we always assume each node to have 2 predecessors (as in NASNets and AmoebaNets etc.).\r\n\r\nHi, @quark0 ,\r\n\r\nAbout question 1, I found if we did not enable cuDNN and set num_workers to 0 in the dataloader, we still cannot produce the same searched result with a fixed seed when running for multiple times. what else factors do you think that affect the reproduciblity?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/626245114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PipiZong","id":55710222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzEwMjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55710222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong","html_url":"https://github.com/PipiZong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PipiZong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3319808615,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMxOTgwODYxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/3319808615","actor":{"login":"quark0","id":4343626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDM2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4343626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-09T22:42:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3319808616,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMTk4MDg2MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/3319808616","actor":{"login":"quark0","id":4343626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDM2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4343626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-09T22:42:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/703999596","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/32#issuecomment-703999596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/32","id":703999596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzk5OTU5Ng==","user":{"login":"d12306","id":42554178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTU0MTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42554178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306","html_url":"https://github.com/d12306","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d12306/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T03:02:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T03:02:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@PipiZong
