For the first question, \r\n\r\n> 1, simple alternating optimization of first order baseline gets similar results to second order with much smaller model size and it actually performs more than two times faster than second order method, however first order is theoretically too much deviated from the formulation of searching objective:\r\n\r\nI'm not pretty sure about it. But according to my understanding, the second order should be slower than the first order, because they have different assumption to the gradient. As you said, second order assumes that weight is defined by alpha. But for the first order one, weight and alpha are equal. The relationship is more like L(w, alpha), compared with L(w(alpha), alpha) (second order).\r\n\r\nFor the second question, I do know something about it:\r\n\r\n> 2, increasing training epochs leading to worse results after some points, which is really counter-intuitive as searching longer should at least gets as good results as less epochs.\r\n\r\nI assume your \"training epochs\" suggests the \"the iteration used during model searching\", which I would call it \"searching epochs\". If so, based on my experience with DARTS, a longer searching epoch tends to \"over-searching\". That is to say, the searched model would get too many \"non-learnable parameters\" (i.e. skip-connects and poolings) when searching too long. Clearly, this phenomenon would limit the performance of the searched model. Actually, [Progress-DARTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12760) noticed this issue and raised a \"search space regularization\" to reduce the effect of \"searching for too many skip-connects.\"\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have some new findings!\r\n\r\nGL,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/512628735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2491285312,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ5MTI4NTMxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2491285312","actor":{"login":"twangnh","id":18298163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjk4MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18298163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh","html_url":"https://github.com/twangnh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-18T01:28:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2491285313,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0OTEyODUzMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2491285313","actor":{"login":"twangnh","id":18298163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjk4MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18298163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh","html_url":"https://github.com/twangnh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twangnh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-18T01:28:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/516902184","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/101#issuecomment-516902184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/101","id":516902184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjkwMjE4NA==","user":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T15:35:00Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T15:35:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

Could you please correct me if I said wrong?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nNeda","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/517286188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2526546800,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUyNjU0NjgwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2526546800","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T13:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2526546802,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MjY1NDY4MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2526546802","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T13:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/517539008","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0/darts/issues/101#issuecomment-517539008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/101","id":517539008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzUzOTAwOA==","user":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-02T04:00:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T04:00:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi! @NdaAzr\r\n\r\nI think you are very correct with most of things.

@NdaAzr !\r\n\r\nThanks again for your questions! Let's solve them one by one:)\r\n> So, I'm wondering why I have max_pool and avg_pool in normal cell? Also, why I have sep_conv in reduction cell?\r\n\r\nWell, that's probably be a question that your algorithem could answer you better than me. According to my experience with DARTS, it is very sensitive to the data you feed in--even the train-valid split rate you use. So, pooling in normal cell and sep_conv in reduction cell are just best options for you code. One more thing to add: DARTS uses poolings with padding. So it actually does not change the shape of your data. LOL\r\n\r\n> second question is, how for the first epoch, could have input c{k-2}? I assumed the first epoch should have only one input which is an input image.\r\n\r\nFor this question, I would recommend you to check the code, especially [model_search.py](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/model_search.py). In this code, line [#73-#76](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/model_search.py#L73-#L76) defines a dowm sampling part named as stem, which is used to process the input data. In the forward function [#103-#113](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/model_search.py#L103-#L113), the output of stem is used as c_{k-1} and c_{k-2}. You could check that at line [#104](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/model_search.py#L104). \r\n\r\n> and last question is based on above learned cell, if c{k-2} would connect to node 0 with sep_cnv_55 and has 16 feature map, and also, c{k-1} would connect to node 0 as well with dil_conv_33 and has 16 feature map, then, second stage, which node 0 would connect to node 1 with avg_pool_33, is node 1 includes 32 feature maps or 16 feature maps will go through avg_pool_33 and 16 feature maps will produce output which is c_{k}.\r\n\r\nSorry I can't catch you. But if you are asking about what happends when two stream of data, i.e. one from c_{k-1} and the other from c_{k-2}, meets at node, i.e. node 0, I could tell you that they simply added together at element level.

How many nodes per cell we should expect? is it always return 4 nodes except output node?\r\n\r\n3. When we retrain the best cell, should we train it with the best cell learned found from first stage? or does it need to retrain from stack of the cells?\r\nfor example if it found the genotype like below should I retrain it with the same genotype or stacked of genotypes?\r\n`genotype = Genotype(normal=[('sep_conv_5x5', 0), ('max_pool_3x3', 1), ('dil_conv_3x3', 0), ('avg_pool_3x3', 1), ('dil_conv_3x3', 3), ('sep_conv_3x3', 0), ('dil_conv_5x5', 0), ('avg_pool_3x3', 3)], normal_concat=range(2, 6), reduce=[('skip_connect', 0), ('sep_conv_3x3', 1), ('skip_connect', 2), ('max_pool_3x3', 0), ('sep_conv_5x5', 0), ('sep_conv_5x5', 1), ('dil_conv_5x5', 1), ('skip_connect', 2)], reduce_concat=range(2, 6))`\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

Do you think is there any specific reason for that? and what step = 4 and multiplier=4 does in the code?\r\n\r\n5. I am still not sure why DARTS return same genotype during all epochs for my dataset? It makes me worry that I have a mistake in the code! Is it happened in your case to get same genotype during all epochs? how first epoch with 13% acc could be same as epoch 10 with 30% accuracy?\r\nI can see that in this Github, they produce a gif animation that displays the cell is changing during all epochs. If I change the dataset size or number of dataset class would produce different genotype.

@NdaAzr \r\nLet's look at the questions directly!\r\n> Regarding DARTS paper figure 1.b, is this a cell or stack of cells? if it's cell why there are three branches per node? and at the end in figure1.d why just it kept one branch however, based on the code in the cell that DARTS produce each node should pick 2 inputs.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a cell, but it is NOT THE SAME as cells used to search. And there is one more thing to notice: it is not that DARTS keeps two operations on each edge but keeps two edges for each node.\r\n\r\n> How many nodes per cell we should expect? is it always return 4 nodes except output node?\r\n\r\nFor both normal and reduction cell, they have 6 nodes. NO.0-1 are inputs node, which are c_{k-1} and c_{k-2} as you mentioned in previous reply. And the rest, NO.2-5, are nodes used during searching process. The main difference is that input nodes CANNOT decide which previous cell to connect while the rest can decide which other node to connect(keep two edges for each node) and in what way (operations).\r\n\r\n> When we retrain the best cell, should we train it with the best cell learned found from first stage? or does it need to retrain from stack of the cells?\r\nfor example if it found the genotype like below should I retrain it with the same genotype or stacked of genotypes?\r\ngenotype = Genotype(normal=[('sep_conv_5x5', 0), ('max_pool_3x3', 1), ('dil_conv_3x3', 0), ('avg_pool_3x3', 1), ('dil_conv_3x3', 3), ('sep_conv_3x3', 0), ('dil_conv_5x5', 0), ('avg_pool_3x3', 3)], normal_concat=range(2, 6), reduce=[('skip_connect', 0), ('sep_conv_3x3', 1), ('skip_connect', 2), ('max_pool_3x3', 0), ('sep_conv_5x5', 0), ('sep_conv_5x5', 1), ('dil_conv_5x5', 1), ('skip_connect', 2)], reduce_concat=range(2, 6))\r\n\r\nAccording to the paper, you should retrain them from stack of the cells. To decide how many cells to uses, you could check [the layer parameter](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/train_imagenet.py#L32) in train_imagenet.py. Also, you could check [line 184-195 of model.py](https://github.com/quark0/darts/blob/master/cnn/model.py#L184-#L195) to see how to decide which cell is reduction and which is normal.\r\n\r\n> I can see in model_search.py line #63 stem_multiplier=3 which increase the number of initial layer from 16 to 48? Do you think is there any specific reason for that? and what step = 4 and multiplier=4 does in the code?\r\n\r\nI've asked someone who has an research field in automl/nas. He told me that most of the hyperparameters used in DARTS are experience from past, i.e. using stem_mulitiplier=3 is simply because is is found good in previous CNN applied to CIFAR/ImageNet. And that is the same for other hyperparameter you mentioned. He also gives me a suggestion for applying DARTS to other dataset: try to build couple of baselines, and use those hyperparameter as your search space to explore new structures.\r\n\r\n>  I am still not sure why DARTS return same genotype during all epochs for my dataset? It makes me worry that I have a mistake in the code! Is it happened in your case to get same genotype during all epochs? how first epoch with 13% acc could be same as epoch 10 with 30% accuracy?\r\nI can see that in this Github, they produce a gif animation that displays the cell is changing during all epochs. If I change the dataset size or number of dataset class would produce different genotype. However genotypes are similar during all epochs?\r\n\r\nDon't worry! It is only used to keep track with the change of your structures. Also don't worry about the accuracy during searching process: they are simply useless. I think you could stop searching as long as your structure no longer change.\r\n\r\nI have some last words to say: don't be too worried about structure generated by DARTS. If you read some following works after DARTS, many of them found that DARTS is very efficient to generate a model, but it is never guarantee to be optimial. Remember the guy I mentioned in lines above? He told me that this is an unsolved problem currenly faced by NAS: no matter what way you use, RL or GB, none of them could guarantee to always have an optimal structure. So, from a practical way, I would suggest you to 1) repeat couple of times of your searching process and find the best using retrain; 2) there are also some following works of DARTS and they are better than DARTS! i.e. I use [PC-DARTS](https://github.com/yuhuixu1993/PC-DARTS) to search for a structure on a subset of celeb (1k people), and I got valid accuracy of 98.2\r\n\r\nGL,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/comments/519331468/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Catosine","id":35353368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzUzMzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35353368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine","html_url":"https://github.com/Catosine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Catosine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2541846246,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU0MTg0NjI0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/events/2541846246","actor":{"login":"NdaAzr","id":35597803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTk3ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35597803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr","html_url":"https://github.com/NdaAzr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NdaAzr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-08T01:53:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
