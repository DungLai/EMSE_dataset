How did you choose the framework, just follow NasNet? I found that in this framework, ‘Relu’ is placed at  the front end of each module, before the conv rather than after it. This arrangement might result in more relu operations and is not friendly to some hardware. I'm confused about this, could you give me some explanation?\r\nthank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
