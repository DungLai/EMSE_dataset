I have read your paper, and I am confused about how to make sure the number of the kernels in \"conv\" operation? \r\nIn ```operations.py``` it seems like 'c_in==c_out', but I wonder why. I always think that NAS is to determine not only the TYPE of the operations but also the NUMBERs, like the number of the kernels, which makes it difficult. I don't know if there is anything that I misunderstand?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
