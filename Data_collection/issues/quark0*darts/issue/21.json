And this line calculates equation 7 in paper. In function _hessian_vector_product, you seem to add `vector` directly to `model_unrolled` parameters, which in equation means `w+ = w' + updates`. But in equation 7, `w+` equals updates applied to original `w` : `w+ = w + updates`.\r\nMay I ask is this intended behaviour or did I understand incorrectly?","closed_by":{"login":"quark0","id":4343626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDM2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4343626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
