For DARTS complexity analysis, anyone have any idea how to derive the *(k+1)\\*k/2* expression ?  Why 2 input nodes ?  How will the calculated value change if graph isomorphism is considered ?  Why \"2+3+4+5\" learnable edges ?  If there is lack of connection, the paper should not add 1 which does not actually contribute to learnable edges configurations at all ?\r\n\r\n2. Why need to train the weights for normal cells and reduction cells **separately** as shown in Figures 4 and 5 below ?\r\n\r\n3. How to arrange the nodes such that the NAS search will actually converge with minimum error ?   Note: Not all nodes are connected to each and every other nodes\r\n\r\n4.
