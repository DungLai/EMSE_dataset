I am a little confused by the line 58 in your model_search.py file, which writes as following:\r\n**return torch.cat(states[-**self._multiplier**:], dim=1)**\r\nFollowing the paper, the hidden states for concat operation should be the last **self._steps** states, so I think it should write as following:\r\n**return torch.cat(states[-**self._steps**:], dim=1)**\r\nHowever, I am not sure whether my understanding is right. Looking forward for your response.","closed_by":{"login":"tengteng95","id":11420406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDIwNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11420406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95","html_url":"https://github.com/tengteng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengteng95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
