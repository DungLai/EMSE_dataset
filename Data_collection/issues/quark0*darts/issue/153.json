Looking at equation 7, we have a second-order partial derivative which is computationally expensive to compute. To solve this, the finite difference method is used.  <-- how is second-order partial derivative related to [finite difference method](https://mythrex.github.io/math_behind_darts/) ?\r\n3. We also note that when momentum is enabled for weight optimisation, the one-step unrolled learning objective in equation 6 is modiﬁed accordingly and all of our analysis still applies. <--  How is momentum directly related to the need of applying chain rule to equation 6 ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
