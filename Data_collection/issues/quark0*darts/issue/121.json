I am a beginner of CS, and I am very interested in this project, I read all the code. However, I have two questions about code.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1:\r\nThe question about the formula for the second-order approximation in the paper and code.\r\n\r\nIn the paper, w+ =w + ε*▽w'L_val(w',α) and w- =w - ε*▽w'L_val(w',α)，how is ▽w'L_val(w',α) expressed in the code? I mean how to calculate ▽w'L_val(w',α) in the code? I don't think this value is calculated in the code?\r\n\r\nI currently have 2 kinds of understanding:\r\n1.\tIn the code, `/cnn/architect.py`\r\nI guess it should be `vector = [v.grad.data for v in unrolled_model.parameters()] [Line 49]` for this formula ▽w'L_val(w',α). However, I think `v.grad.data` is just a parameter that is manually updated in function `_compute_unrolled_model [Line 20]` (becoming virtual gradient step in the paper) , I have not found a code implementation that uses the validation set to derive w'.\r\n\r\n2.\tIn the code, `/cnn/architect.py` \r\nAnother guess is that ▽w'L_val(w',α) is calculated in `unrolled_loss.backward() [Line 47]`, but the optimization parameter of the optimizer in `unrolled_model` is `model.arch_parameters() [Line 17]`. I don't think this step will calculate the derivative of L_val(w',α) to w'. In addition, the paper also shows that optimizing L_val(w',α) will fixed w, so how to calculate ▽w'L_val(w',α) in the code? Is it wrong with my understanding of Pytorch?\r\n\r\nQuestion 2:\r\nIn `/cnn/architect.py [Line 76]` \r\nWhy not use `ε=r=1e-2` directly and use `ε=r/_concat(vector).norm()`, it is a bit redundant to divide by _concat(vector).norm()?\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply, thank you very much.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TianQi-777","id":30693632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkzNjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30693632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777","html_url":"https://github.com/TianQi-777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianQi-777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
