In function _train_ in _train_search.py_, **input_search** and **target_search** are unchanged during iteration. They are always the first batch in **search_queue**.\r\n\r\n Is it a small bug or you do it by purpose?","closed_by":{"login":"yukang2017","id":24690867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjkwODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24690867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017","html_url":"https://github.com/yukang2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukang2017/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
