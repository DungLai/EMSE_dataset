I found that the network I searched was too big compared to the network released in Darts. The param_size of my result model are generally 8M， while released mode‘s is nearly 3M.\r\nCould you tell me the reason why the results are different. Or I just should continue to search for more networks.\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
