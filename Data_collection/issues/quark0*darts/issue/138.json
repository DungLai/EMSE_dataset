And I thought Cell-based search is like this:\r\n\r\n**1.  Search for best cell(Normal cell and Reduction cell) separately at first.\r\n2.Stack these 2 cells to construct the entire model by human and then re-train it.**\r\n\r\nSo the whole process will be in 2 stage(search for cells and stack them with re-train the model).\r\n\r\nBut when I read the code, I found that the entire model(stack by cells) has been defined at first, so the training loss and validation loss is come from the entire model.\r\nSo, **how to calculate the gradient of the architecture weight(alpha) and then backprop it?** \r\nBecause when update the alpha, there are many cells with different number of weights(filters) due to different channel size but alpha are shared by same kind of cell,\r\n\r\nIf there are somethings I missing, please tell me, thanks.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/138/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
