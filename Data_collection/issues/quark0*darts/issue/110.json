I use the code [https://github.com/quark0/darts/](url) and reproduce the test process. It's great! But I cannot reproduce the architecture search process to obtain the same or similar as the DART_V2 architecture. I run \"train_search.py\" following your paper. There was an overfitting during the training and the final valid loss was 6.56. \r\n\r\nIs this result normal? If not, can you give me some advice?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
