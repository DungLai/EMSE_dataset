Really enjoy your paper. Here I have a problem and hope to get your help. I run the search code with 5 different random seeds, including the default seed and get 5 different RNN architectures. However, when I train these 5 architectures respectively from scratch, I get test ppl of 57.16, 61, 57.81, 60.99 and 57.53. None of them get a test ppl around 56. Is there anything I missed to get a robust result of 56.1 or 55.8 in the paper?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
