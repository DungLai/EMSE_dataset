However, DARTS appears to concatenate all the intermediate hidden states regardless. For example, in DARTS_v2 normal cell, the hidden state h2 (marked as \"0\" in the blue square when visualizing) outputs to hidden state h5 (marked as \"3\" in the blue square when visualizing), but it still gets concat. to the output for next cell (\"c_{k}\"). It this intentional or a bug? Does this only apply to the visualize.py ?\r\n\r\nAs a result, the implemented Reduction Cell of NASNet-A in the genotypes.py is not the same as the one shown in the original NASNet paper. In the NASNet paper, NASNet-A reduction cell has three intermediate hidden states outputs concat. together. But in DARTS's implementation of NASNet-A reduction cell, all five hidden states outputs are concat. A similar situation applies to AmoebaNet implementation as well. \r\n \r\nAre the results reported in your paper for NASNet-A and AmoebaNet-A correspond to this implementation?","closed_by":{"login":"mikelzc1990","id":25613965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjEzOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25613965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990","html_url":"https://github.com/mikelzc1990","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikelzc1990/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
