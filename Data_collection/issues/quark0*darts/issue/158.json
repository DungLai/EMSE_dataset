This is different from the respective size of your pretrained model `cifar10_model.pt` in README.md, which is (108, 3, 3, 3). Did I miss something? Did you get `cifar10_model.pt` by a different architecture search code? Thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"chengrunyang","id":8860197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjAxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8860197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang","html_url":"https://github.com/chengrunyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengrunyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
