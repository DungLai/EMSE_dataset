Becauce it tells us as searching time growing, the searched model will be improved. \r\n\r\n![Fig3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26025440/108598429-73e56900-73c8-11eb-9d9e-fd6c964ff487.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n I run the `train_search.py` code  4 times with different random seed. Then I get the result below. The x-axis denotes how many gpu hours I trained to get the model and y-axis denotes the performance of searched model after training for 300 epoch.  Except for neccssacy changes to run the code successfully on `pytorch1.7 +cuda 11.`. I didn't change any code in original code.\r\n\r\nThe result shows below, we can see that as searching time grows, the searched model will **NOT**  be improved. \r\n\r\n\r\n![my reproduce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26025440/108598217-5368df00-73c7-11eb-8182-a6f055602881.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
