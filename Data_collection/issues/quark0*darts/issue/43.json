There are three issues:\r\n1 . AmoebaNet-A with 3.34 Â± 0.06 test error and 3.2 M params in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01548v3.pdf) is trained **without cutout**.\r\n2. The search cost for NASNet-A is different in the first an the second line (1800 vs 3150). I refer to the latest [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07012.pdf), it is 2000 GPU days, 4 days with 500 GPUS.\r\n3. In my view, using GPU days (number of GPUs x days) as metrics is not fair. Because, the running speed on two GPUs is less than twice as the speed on one GPU. In the other word, running on two GPUs across 1 day are not simply same to running one GPU across 2 days, although they are both 2 GPU days.\r\n\r\nBest \r\nYukang","closed_by":{"login":"quark0","id":4343626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDM2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4343626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
