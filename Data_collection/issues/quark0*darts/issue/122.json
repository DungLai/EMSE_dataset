In your paper, you said using zero initialization for architecture variables, which implies equal amount attention over all possible ops. However, in your code,  you initialize the architecture variables randomly:  ' Variable(1e-3*torch.randn(k, num_ops).cuda(), requires_grad=True)'  in your code.  Could you please explain why you use this random initialization?
