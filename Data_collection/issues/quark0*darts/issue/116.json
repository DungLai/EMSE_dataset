Thanks for your sharing this work.\r\n\r\nI have a small doubt about the result of Figure 2 when ξ = 0.5. I tired to reproduce this figure, but when I set ξ=0.5, the convergence point is still (2,2) same with ξ = 0 and alpha has never been updated. So, I calculate the gradient of alpha in the initial point. the gradient of train loss w.r.t w is gd=2w-2a, then mul ξ=0.5. So the gradient of alpha is [w-ξ*gd]-2=[w-0.5*(2w-2a)]-2=0 because a=2, alpha should not be update. But in Figure 2, alpha is updating in the begining and then convergence at (1,1).\r\n\r\nI wonder if I misunderstand the second-order approximation? If I am wrong, hope you can tell me.
