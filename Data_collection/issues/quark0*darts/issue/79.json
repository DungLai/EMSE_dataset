But, in the code, you don't select pooling layers explicitly and you just set stride to 2.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean after learning and pruning, the best-found weights belong to pooling/skip connection operations? Just want to make sure :)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
