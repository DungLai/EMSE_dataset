I use the default search script on cifar10 ```python train_search.py --unrolled --seed 0``` to search the architecture. I found the architecture is different with the one provided by the paper (also in the genotypes.py of the repo). If I change the seed, the architecture will also change. In the paper, the authors mentioned the results are obtained by 4 runs. So my questions: **Do the 4 runs use the same architecture? Or use 4 different architectures?**, and **How the illustrated architecture in the paper is selected?**\r\n\r\n2. On my own run to search the architecture, I found the probability of the zero op is the highest. However, in the paper, the authors mentioned that zero op is not used in the final architecture (Sec.2.4). This is also confirmed in the code. My question is **If zero op is not used, why we add a zeros in the searching space?** It is really weird since if we do not excluded the zero op, all the ops will be zero ;-(. Does the author have the same problems? For example, the alphas for normal cell is\r\n\r\n[[0.1838, 0.0982, 0.081 , 0.1736, 0.1812, 0.0846, 0.091 , 0.1066],\r\n       [0.4717, 0.0458, 0.0496, 0.0945, 0.1113, 0.0556, 0.0953, 0.0762],\r\n       [0.2946, 0.1425, 0.0855, 0.1768, 0.0837, 0.0735, 0.0731, 0.0704],\r\n       [0.3991, 0.0631, 0.0581, 0.1053, 0.1307, 0.0577, 0.1043, 0.0817],\r\n       [0.6298, 0.0382, 0.035 , 0.0658, 0.0435, 0.0551, 0.0605, 0.0721],\r\n       [0.3526, 0.0974, 0.0693, 0.1346, 0.1245, 0.0697, 0.091 , 0.061 ],\r\n       [0.4829, 0.06  , 0.0612, 0.115 , 0.0969, 0.065 , 0.0624, 0.0565],\r\n       [0.6591, 0.0303, 0.0282, 0.0558, 0.0578, 0.054 , 0.0581, 0.0568],\r\n       [0.7612, 0.0199, 0.0207, 0.0294, 0.0343, 0.0442, 0.0431, 0.0472],\r\n       [0.3519, 0.1231, 0.0692, 0.1381, 0.0925, 0.076 , 0.0748, 0.0744],\r\n       [0.4767, 0.0781, 0.0679, 0.1216, 0.0679, 0.0701, 0.0548, 0.0629],\r\n       [0.6769, 0.032 , 0.0292, 0.0547, 0.0533, 0.0427, 0.0614, 0.0498],\r\n       [0.7918, 0.0191, 0.0199, 0.0279, 0.0423, 0.0223, 0.0392, 0.0375],\r\n       [0.8325, 0.0153, 0.0158, 0.0199, 0.0284, 0.0255, 0.0313, 0.0313]]\r\n\r\nEach row is the probability of ['none', 'max_pool_3x3','avg_pool_3x3','skip_connect','sep_conv_3x3','sep_conv_5x5','dil_conv_3x3','dil_conv_5x5'] for each edge.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"quark0","id":4343626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDM2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4343626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0","html_url":"https://github.com/quark0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
