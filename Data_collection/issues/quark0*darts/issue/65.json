I noticed that in model.py you defined different initial stem layers for CIFAR and ImageNet, with ImageNet being more complex. Is there an intuitive reason for doing it this way, like due to the larger image sizes in ImageNet? Or is it just empirically better performance when you do it this way?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quark0/darts/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
