However, the result is really bad when I change the --num_labeled parameter to 100 and 200. For example, if I set num_labeled to 100 and keep other hyper-parameters unchanged, test error on the model with best validation error is 68.83999633789062.\r\nCan you please tell me the hyper-parameters used in CIFAR-10 with 1000 and 2000 labels?\r\nThank you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vikasverma1077/ICT/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vikasverma1077/ICT/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
