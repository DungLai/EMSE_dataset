The process to find mosaics and clean mosaics for 1 frame is completely independent of any other frames. Completion of the loops would be much faster if they were processed with multiple threads. For example, if I use waifu2x to upscale a video, I have the option to specify the number of threads. I choose 5 so when the frames of the video are being looped, 5 of them will be processed at a time.\r\n\r\nAre you able to do it? I have bare minimum knowledge of Python so I don't know if it is possible. I would have forked this project and done it myself if it was C++ or C#.
