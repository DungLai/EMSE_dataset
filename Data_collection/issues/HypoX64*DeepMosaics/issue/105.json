Install CUDA [11.6 in my case].  I have removed all previous CUDA versions so 11.6 is the only one I had\r\n3. Install PyTorch - the stable version only supports up to 11.3, the nightly build supports 11.6 [instructions here] https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-cuda-11-6/149647\r\n4. Install Torchvision - this was to be compiled at source, [instruction here] https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-installation\r\n5. Installed other packages (latest versions of numpy etc have worked for me)\r\n\r\nThe above setup worked for me - YMMV\r\n\r\nBonus: I ran into a JSON error which was fixed by updating the PATH environment variable.  Reason was because I had my ffmpeg package program files saved within the venv and I deleted it when I fresh installed (see issue #94)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
