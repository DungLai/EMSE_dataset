I have never done a pull request before, but i will try to create one with all the changes needed.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases this could cause problems when a audio codec is not supported by the mka container. The only thing that comes to my mind right now tho is DSD audio formats, but i have never seen one in a video file...
