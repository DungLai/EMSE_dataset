I have wanted to get the GPU command prompt version to work as the GUI version.exe kept getting errors that DeepMosaics said where too complicated on another post. After getting the command prompt version to work, the video output is the same as the input. There is no error while running the source code.\r\n\r\nWhile using source code GPU version when step two starts the python program goes to not responding. After 15 minutes it will work again, but never finds any mosaic. The program runs without any errors. The only thing I can think off is my CPU is too weak and is causing the not responding on start of step two.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
