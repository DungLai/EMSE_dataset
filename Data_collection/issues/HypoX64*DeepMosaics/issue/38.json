I was half way through the identify mosaic phase with 114,000 frames to process which took more than a day and my machine crashed and now I can't resume my project but have to start again which means I'll have to cut the video into smaller chunks to avoid this problem in future. Although it's rare for my machine to crash or reset without my say-so this does happen with the latest windows versions which install updates in the early hours. I see this being a useful function for everyone for those situations that can sometimes arise.
