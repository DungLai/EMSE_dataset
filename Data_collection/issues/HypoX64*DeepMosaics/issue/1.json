I'm wondering if it's right to use the original CPU at that stage, and if there are additional settings to use the GPU.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
