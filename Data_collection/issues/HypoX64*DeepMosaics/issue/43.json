All of the frames have mosaic but ~1/2 of them have mosaiced areas that are too small to be detected with the default threshold of 64. By setting the threshold = 2 all frames are demosaiced, but those with large mosaiced areas are damaged by the very low threshold!\n\nProposed Solution - if no mosaic is detected initally, the threshold is decreased and the demosaic is reatempted until mosaic is found, and the threshold would be reset to the default for the first attemp of the following frame \n\nIm still fairly new to Python so idk how that would be coded, I'm still learning the languageðŸ˜… also if its possible to retrain a model on CPU, however slow it may be would still be preferable\n\nIE) if the same 100frames are attemped 10000times, attempt 10000 should look better than attemp 1, not be identical","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
