You can safely ignore it when using ffmpeg from the command-line, and you don't have to fix anything.\r\n\r\nThe warning occurs when converting from a yuv420p source to JPEG, which makes ffmpeg choose yuvj420p as output format. That format is required for writing files with the mjpeg encoder. These two pixel formats have different color ranges (the former from 16‚Äì235, the latter from 0‚Äì255). The warning is meant for using FFmpeg as a library in your own code (like here).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1273920/deprecated-pixel-format-used-make-sure-you-did-set-range-correctly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/comments/826440301/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CnMao2","id":52405796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDA1Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52405796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2","html_url":"https://github.com/CnMao2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/comments/826440552","html_url":"https://github.com/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/50#issuecomment-826440552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypoX64/DeepMosaics/issues/50","id":826440552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjQ0MDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"CnMao2","id":52405796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDA1Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52405796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2","html_url":"https://github.com/CnMao2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CnMao2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-26T01:16:12Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T01:16:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
