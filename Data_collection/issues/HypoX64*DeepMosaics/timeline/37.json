think i figured out why \"DM\" has to be what rebuilds the video after demosaicing, and why there isnt a \"Resume Button\", both are due to the nature of AIðŸ˜… (it learns as it goes) so when it creates the demosaiced images using the masks they are a rough estimate that allowes them to be more easily processed into the final product \r\n\r\n{When the frames are reassembled into a video using VirtualDub2 they do look much better than the originals but when played at the same framerate the \"repaired\" areas are slightly blurry and have a subtle ripple like when you skip a stone on water but really close together} \r\n\r\nTheory)\r\nWhen \"DM\" reassembles the video from the images it doesnt just string them back together, it takes what it learned from doing the rough estimates and smooths them \"over time\" which in this case means across multiple frames, compensating for vector/trajectory/entropy of objects within the frames, and \"filling in the blanks\" of each frame using the known pixels from its nearest neighbors (Sequentialy Speaking) as reference points. \r\n\r\nThe final output video is then sharpened (only in the repaired areas) so that they match as close as possible to the rest of that frame of the video, which is then resynced with the audio, recompressed and saved to the \"Result Folder\"\r\n\r\nStill on the same video as before but using a different computer that is slower but doesnt freeze!\r\n200Hours down & ~430Hours
