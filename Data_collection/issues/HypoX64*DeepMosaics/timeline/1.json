I'm wondering if it's right to use the original CPU at that stage, and if there are additional settings to use the GPU.\r\n\r\nI found out that ffmpeg can use gpu through the '-hwaccel cuvid' option, but it doesn't work if I modify it in the ffmpeg.py file.

So, when use GPU, it may waste many time in read data and preprocess.I wil use multi-Progress to fix this problem.\r\nAnd for ffmpeg, I never try to use it on gpu.
