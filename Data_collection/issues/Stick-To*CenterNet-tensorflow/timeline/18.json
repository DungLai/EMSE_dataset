tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)\r\n        optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)\r\n        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())\r\n        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)\r\n```\r\n我发现删去update_ops后，是可以更新step的。这会不会与model的bn层有关系呢，update_ops出了一些问题？我看了网站上的一些资料，也有人遇到了类似的问题[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52976606/global-step-not-incrementing-with-batch-norm-and-custom-estimator]()。期间我还尝试使用了hook函数去中断loss为Nan的情况，但很遗憾现在还是没有找到问题的根源，蟹蟹你耐心的解答。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/comments/532493721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YangYangGirl","id":32426369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDI2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32426369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl","html_url":"https://github.com/YangYangGirl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/comments/532498244","html_url":"https://github.com/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/18#issuecomment-532498244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/18","id":532498244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjQ5ODI0NA==","user":{"login":"YangYangGirl","id":32426369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDI2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32426369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl","html_url":"https://github.com/YangYangGirl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T03:02:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T03:02:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"值得一提的是，我们的框架目前只支持batch_size为1，这与现在bn层的update_ops问题有关联吗？但是我们在thundernet中也使用了bn层，没有遇到类似的问题。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/comments/532498244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YangYangGirl","id":32426369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDI2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32426369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl","html_url":"https://github.com/YangYangGirl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangYangGirl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/comments/532498598","html_url":"https://github.com/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/18#issuecomment-532498598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Stick-To/CenterNet-tensorflow/issues/18","id":532498598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjQ5ODU5OA==","user":{"login":"Stick-To","id":34546552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQ2NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34546552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stick-To","html_url":"https://github.com/Stick-To","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stick-To/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stick-To/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.gith
