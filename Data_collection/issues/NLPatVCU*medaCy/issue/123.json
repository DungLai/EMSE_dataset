This behavior is not observed when it is the only file that is trained. Following are the examples of 2 such files in TAC (2008) data set.\r\n**File : PMC1257590.ann**\r\nDose 929 932\t400\r\n\r\n**PMC4847079.ann**\r\nDose 1394 1398\t25.6\r\nDose 1409 1413\t30.7\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\nRun 5 fold cross validation using the systematic_review_pipeline on the following files individually and with more than two files and compare the MedaCy ground truth files for the mentioned Dose instances above\r\n1.
