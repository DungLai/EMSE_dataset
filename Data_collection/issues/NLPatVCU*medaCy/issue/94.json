The error will be thrown when it attempts to restore the document back.\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nText has non-ascii characters again and the character spans in the metamap dictionary are updated to reflect the restoration.\r\n#### Actual Results\r\nError thrown.\r\n#### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following snippet and paste the output below.\r\nimport platform; print(platform.platform())\r\nimport sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nimport numpy; print(\"NumPy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nimport scipy; print(\"SciPy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nimport medacy; print(\"medacy\", medacy.__version__)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLinux-4.15.0-43-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nPython 3.5.2 (default, Nov 12 2018, 13:43:14) \r\nmedacy 0.0.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"swfarnsworth","id":32915757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTE1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32915757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth","html_url":"https://github.com/swfarnsworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
