This will allow users to install, build, and work with data in an efficient manner while allowing complete control over who has access to that data. \r\n\r\n- medaCy can be broken into three parts: loading data, loading models, manipulating models and data (that is, training, prediction, meta-information extraction, etc). medaCy currently does all three in one package - but storing data and models takes a lot of memory. The architecture for the package should transition towards the direction of leaving only code that orchestrates the interaction between data and models in this repository while allowing actual data and models to be interfaced from separate compatible python packages. A nomenclature like medacy_model_***** and medacy_dataset_**** for external package naming makes sense although outside developers could clearly name their packages freely.\r\n\r\n- Dataset's that are included for benchmarking/testing purposes can be made into open repositories while anyone could also create a private version of a dataset by following directions on how to make their private package interface medaCy.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- [DataLoader](medacy/tools/data_loader.py) should be refactored to something like  *Dataset* (this nomenclature makes more sense if one considers what the current DataLoader class does). \r\n- Each python package corresponding to a dataset can be installed/removed freely and has medaCy as an installation requirement. \r\n- Each medacy compatible dataset package should return an instantiated, ready-to-work-with version of the Dataset class. This class should include all functionality currently present in DataLoader alongside also sidestepping the init method from a machine directory to load data present in a medacy compatible data package.\r\n- Detailed instructions should be provided to write a custom interfacing data package (maybe provide a boilerplate template repository).\r\n- Ideally, the internals of Dataset will store a generator containing raw text files and annotation files alongside meta-data about the dataset (entities and types of entity relationships). These can then be looped through at will by the current code for processing documents - steps should be taken to insure this process is as memory efficient as possible as big corpora could be used.","closed_by":{"login":"AndriyMulyar","id":13879686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc5Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13879686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriyMulyar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriyMulyar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
