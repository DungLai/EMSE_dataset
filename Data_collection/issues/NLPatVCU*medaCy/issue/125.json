I would like to use use a medaCy in the way that one would typically use spaCy, in terms of pipeline components.  That is, create a doc and use the doc attributes (ents, annotations, etc).  Is there a way to load something like a clinical note and use it like you would in a spaCy pipeline?  Is there a way to extend the spaCy pipeline with medaCy models so that annotations can be visualized with displaCy, or some approximation of these things. I read the docs and looked at the code base, but it wasn't clear to me whether this was currently possible or not.  Any help and/or clarification would be appreciated.   I'm currently trying out medaCy to extract drug doseage information from clinical notes.  The ner is doing a great job of extraction, being able to use this model in the way one would use models in spaCy would be very helpful for our proof of concept stage.","closed_by":{"login":"baumanab","id":4316306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTYzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4316306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab","html_url":"https://github.com/baumanab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baumanab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
