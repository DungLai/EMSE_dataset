This code snippet should work:\r\n```python\r\nfrom medacy.pipeline_components import MetaMap\r\n\r\nmedy = MetaMap(metamap_path=\"/home/lab/programs/metamap/2016/public_mm\")\r\nme_dict = medy.map_file(\"subtest_in/018636330_DH.txt\")\r\nmapped_terms = medy.extract_mapped_terms(me_dict)\r\nme_ann = medy.mapped_terms_to_spacy_ann(mapped_terms)\r\nprint(me_ann)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust an FYI, there is also a [Dataset](https://github.com/NanoNLP/medaCy/blob/master/medacy/data/dataset.py) class that handles reading in and metamapping files(can be used to metamap a directory of files at once) that I'd recommend using.  All of MedaCy's features for training models and predicting with them require the data to be packaged in a Dataset object.  [Here's a guide we wrote using it](https://github.com/NanoNLP/medaCy/blob/master/examples/guide/data_management.md#using-a-dataset), feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/comments/451065385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CoreySutphin","id":15355736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzU1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15355736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin","html_url":"https://github.com/CoreySutphin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2053036525,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA1MzAzNjUyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/events/2053036525","actor":{"login":"CoreySutphin","id":15355736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzU1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15355736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin","html_url":"https://github.com/CoreySutphin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoreySutphin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T18:38:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
