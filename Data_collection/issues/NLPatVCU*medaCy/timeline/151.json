I can think of two potential causes for this error:\r\n\r\n1. The last function call in your stack that occurs in medaCy code is `spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")`. Do you have that model installed? The command to install it is `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.\r\n2. I have never worked with Anaconda before, so you might try making a virtual environment using the standard venv module.\r\n\r\nWe're finishing a large update to medaCy that should be available in the development branch this week. If neither of these solutions work, I'd prefer to continue troubleshooting using the next version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/comments/547968747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"swfarnsworth","id":32915757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTE1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32915757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth","html_url":"https://github.com/swfarnsworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3371467192,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM3MTQ2NzE5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/events/3371467192","actor":{"login":"swfarnsworth","id":32915757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTE1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32915757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth","html_url":"https://github.com/swfarnsworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swfarnsworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-25T23:59:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
