A model trained upon it is given here, though the API for it was designed before we transitioned medaCy to a primarily command line application. This file is the actual model, and if you download it, you should be able to use it with medaCy's command line interface's predict functionality, using ClinicalPipeline as the pipeline option.\nThis particular model uses a conditional random field. We have had more success with BiLSTM and BERT models, though these have better performance when a GPU is available.\nPlease let us know if we can be of further assistance.\nSteele\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/comments/751930731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"balachander1964","id":68279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjc5MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964","html_url":"https://github.com/balachander1964","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balachander1964/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
