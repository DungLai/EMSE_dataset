And I saw some cases like O -> I in the prediction. So I wanna use CRF with some constraint so that I can further improve the performance. I think I'm going to modify the pytorch-crf code, but I just not quite sure how to do it and confused about the index. Hope you can help, thank you in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NLPatVCU/medaCy/issues/comments/989171775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lkqnaruto","id":43921052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTIxMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43921052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto","html_url":"https://github.com/lkqnaruto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkqnaruto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
