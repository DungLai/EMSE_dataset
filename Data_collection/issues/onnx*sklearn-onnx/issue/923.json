I have this problem with my try to convert in onnx a XGBoost model when I use \r\n* onx = convert_sklearn(forecaster, 'PrediccionElectrica',[('input', FloatTensorType([None, 2]))]) \r\n\r\n\r\nMissingShapeCalculator: Unable to find a shape calculator for type '<class 'skforecast.ForecasterAutoreg.ForecasterAutoreg.ForecasterAutoreg'>'.\r\nIt usually means the pipeline being converted contains a\r\ntransformer or a predictor with no corresponding converter\r\nimplemented in sklearn-onnx. If the converted is implemented\r\nin another library, you need to register\r\nthe converted so that it can be used by sklearn-onnx (function\r\nupdate_registered_converter). If the model is not yet covered\r\nby sklearn-onnx, you may raise an issue to\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues\r\nto get the converter implemented or even contribute to the\r\nproject. If the model is a custom model, a new converter must\r\nbe implemented. Examples can be found in the gallery.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
