The scoring method worked well when I used OnnxRuntime.\r\n\r\nNow I got a new problem when I implemented my model to the new platform in this case Unity, where Unity could only load ONNX using Baraccuda with a limited type of operator.\r\n\r\nBaraccuda in Unity doesn't contain operator of ReduceLogSumExp and ReduceSumSquare that appear in my model. For now, Baraccuda then suggest me to change this operator in onnx model to:\r\n\r\nx -> y = exp(x) -> z = reduce_sum(y) -> log(z) for ReduceLogSumExp\r\nand\r\nx -> y = x^2 -> z = reduce_sum(y) for ReduceSumSquare\r\n\r\nCould I customize the conversion so ReduceLogSumExp automatically just only used Exp and reduce_sum and reducesumsquare used square and reduce sum?\r\n\r\nThank You for your kind support.\r\n\r\nAnd here I attached the visualization of my onnx model:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57290644/80723542-568e9800-8b33-11ea-8918-d7c14a4abc3d.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alexivaner","id":57290644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjkwNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57290644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner","html_url":"https://github.com/alexivaner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
