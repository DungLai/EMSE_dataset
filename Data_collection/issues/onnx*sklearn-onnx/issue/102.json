I want to make machine learning models using python3 and scikit-learn, then want to run on Go programs using a [golearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn) project. I think that ONNX-ML is the best format to pass trained model parameters into Go. I feel this project has a great potential.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think that it's better to decide the file-naming convention earlier, because this will be breaking changes.\r\n\r\n* *lowercase_with_underscores*: https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/master/skl2onnx/operator_converters/multilayer_perceptron.py\r\n* *UpperCamelCase*: https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/master/skl2onnx/operator_converters/AdaBoost.py\r\n\r\nI recommend you to use *lowercase_with_underscores* like the most of python projects (including scikit-learn and onnx).
