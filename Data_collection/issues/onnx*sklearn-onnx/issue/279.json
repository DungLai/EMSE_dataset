In that case, to make a prediction, I need to reload the different operations and chain them together like 'transfo.onnx' piping its outputs into 'model_1.onnx', 'transfo.onnx' piping its output into 'model_2.onnx' ...  \r\n\r\nIn a broader scope, is there a way to chain sklearn-onnx steps together to make integrated pipeline like:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n# Input files \r\nstep_onnx_files = [ \r\n    \"step_1.onnx\", \r\n    \"step_2.onnx\", \r\n    \"step_3.onnx\", \r\n    \"step_4.onnx\", \r\n] \r\n\r\n# Operations to chain \r\noperations = [] \r\nfor step_file in step_files: \r\n    operations.append(onnx.load(open(step_file, 'rb'))) \r\n\r\n# The chaining operation I'm looking for  \r\npipeline = chain(operations) \r\n\r\n# Save chained operation \r\npipeline_file = 'pipeline.onnx' \r\nwith open(pipeline_file, \"wb\") as f: \r\n    f.write(pipeline.SerializeToString())\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"alexandreCameron","id":12397890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzk3ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12397890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandreCameron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandreCameron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
