Love the package.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am trying to convert a simple StandardScaler to ONNX using this package, but I also require the inverse transform (I recon these should be 2 seperate .onnx models), what is currently the best way to do this?\r\n\r\nOne can maybe (?) manually inverse the coefficients of the StandardScaler or something to create a new scaler, but it would feel a bit hacky.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/765/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
