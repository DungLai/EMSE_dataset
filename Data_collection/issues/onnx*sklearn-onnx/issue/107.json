But when I looked at the [`DictionaryType`](https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/master/skl2onnx/common/data_types.py#L134) definition, it appears that there can only be one key type and one value type (in other words, all the keys in an input dictionary must be the same type, and all the values in an input dictionary must be the same type).\r\n\r\nAre there any plans to support mixed types for dictionary keys/values? Supporting mixed types like this could help people take advantage of the sklearn feature engineering transformers better, but I don't know the ONNX limitations or the complexities of adding support for this. Or is this supported in some way I missed?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
