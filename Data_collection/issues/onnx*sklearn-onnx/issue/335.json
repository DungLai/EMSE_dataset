I set the target opset to 7 like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nonx = convert_sklearn(clf, initial_types=initial_type, target_opset=7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I check the converted model opset with `converted_model.opset_import` it was always 1. \r\n\r\nIs this a normal behaviour?\r\n\r\nI use Python3.6, sklearn version 0.22 and skl2onnx version 1.6.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.\r\n\r\nFIY this is the `onnxruntime` warning:\r\n```python\r\n2019-12-06 16:19:05.741171855 [W:onnxruntime:Default, model.cc:114 Model] ONNX Runtime only *guarantees* support for models stamped with opset version 7 or above for opset domain 'ai.onnx'.
