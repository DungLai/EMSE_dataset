Is there any way to export this model into **ONNX** format ? \r\n\r\n> _By using  **libsvm** for instance ?_\r\n\r\n2. Will this model be supported by `sklearn-onnx` ?\r\n___\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n```py\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM\r\nfrom skl2onnx import convert_sklearn\r\nfrom skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType\r\n\r\nX = [[0], [0.44], [0.45], [0.46], [1]]\r\n\r\nclf = OneClassSVM(gamma='auto')\r\nclf.fit(X)\r\n\r\n# Convert into ONNX format with onnxmltools\r\ninitial_type = [('float_input', FloatTensorType([1, 4]))]\r\nnx = convert_sklearn(clf, initial_types=initial_type)\r\n# Export model into ONNX format\r\nwith open(\"SVM.onnx\", \"w\") as f:\r\n    f.write(onx.SerializeToString())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error, I've got:\r\n```py\r\nskl2onnx.common.exceptions.MissingShapeCalculator: Unable to find a shape calculator for type '<class 'sklearn.svm.classes.OneClassSVM'>'.\r\n\r\nIt usually means the pipeline being converted contains a\r\ntransformer or a predictor with no corresponding converter\r\nimplemented in sklearn-onnx. If the converted is implemented\r\nin another library (ie: onnxmltools), you need to register\r\nthe converted so that it can be used by sklearn-onnx (function\r\nupdate_registered_converter). If the model is not yet covered\r\nby sklearn-onnx, you may raise an issue to\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues\r\nto get the converter implemented or even contribute to the\r\nproject. If the model is a custom model, a new converter must\r\nbe implemented. Examples can be found in the gallery.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Sorry if it is a dumb question, I'm still a beginner.","closed_by":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
