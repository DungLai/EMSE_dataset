In my case,  there are float and integer column types in my dataframe. I adapted it to my own code using the document [here](http://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/auto_examples/plot_intermediate_outputs.html#id3).\r\n```python\r\ninitial_types = [('float_0', FloatTensorType(shape=[None, 1])),\r\n ('integer_1', Int32TensorType(shape=[None, 2])),\r\n ('float_2', FloatTensorType(shape=[None, 1]))]\r\n\r\n\r\nonx = convert_sklearn(linear_model, initial_types= initial_types)\r\nwith open(\"model.onnx\", \"wb\") as f:\r\n    f.write(onx.SerializeToString())\r\n```\r\n\r\n`RuntimeError: For operator SklearnLinearClassifier (type: SklearnLinearClassifier), at most 1 input(s) is(are) supported but we got 3 output(s) which are ['float_0', 'integer_1', 'float_2']\r\n`\r\n\r\nHowever, I am getting an error. \r\n\r\nDoes SklearnLinearClassifier take only one input? Why can't I define different types of inputs? \r\nCan you help identify the problem here, and how can I solve it?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"muzaffersenkal","id":22756941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzU2OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22756941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal","html_url":"https://github.com/muzaffersenkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muzaffersenkal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
