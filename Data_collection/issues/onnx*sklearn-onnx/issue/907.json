In your 1.12 release, [you didn't include a source distribution file](https://pypi.org/project/skl2onnx/#files) (see 1.11 release for comparison [here](https://pypi.org/project/skl2onnx/1.11/#files)). The source distribution is also missing for 1.11.1 and 1.11.2. We cannot build Conda packages without the source distribution, so I would really appreciate it if you could still add it to those releases.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance for your help! üôè ","closed_by":{"login":"janjagusch","id":25852654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODUyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25852654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch","html_url":"https://github.com/janjagusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
