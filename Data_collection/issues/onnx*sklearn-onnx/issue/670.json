However, following implementing the onnx transformer is extremely difficult due to the confusion with the datatype.\r\nIn this [example](https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/auto_tutorial/plot_icustom_converter.html), what is the datatype of input argument operator. Without the type information, what instance variables does the \"operator\" have and what method are available to us is extremely difficult to investigate. In other words, the difficulty of developing and making contribution is increased significantly.\r\n\r\nI totally understand updating the entire coding project and annotate it with type hint can be difficult, but is it possible just include some of the info in the documentation?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHung-Tien Huang","closed_by":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
