That is because the unique variable name is not taken anymore but a name-variable pair is already set in `Scope.variables`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/314cd07c19a78597c15c2ea10862b4e5d4318aa5/skl2onnx/common/_topology.py#L624-L628\r\n\r\nThis happened to me and was quite difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy suggested solution is to only unreserve an ONNX name, if the name is not already used in `Scope.variables`. If it is, then it should raise a warning instead of throwing an error. You could also make it throw an error, but then you'd have to fix it in `parse_sklearn` (which is I believe the only time the `unreserve_name` function is actually called):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/314cd07c19a78597c15c2ea10862b4e5d4318aa5/skl2onnx/_parse.py#L566-L568\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to get rid of `unreserve_name` altogether, since it's only called once and doesn't seem particularly useful. But maybe I'm mistaken here. ðŸ™‚ ","closed_by":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
