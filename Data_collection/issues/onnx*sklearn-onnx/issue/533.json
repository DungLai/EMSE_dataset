If the converted is implemented\r\nin another library, you need to register\r\nthe converted so that it can be used by sklearn-onnx (function\r\nupdate_registered_converter). If the model is not yet covered\r\nby sklearn-onnx, you may raise an issue to\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues\r\nto get the converter implemented or even contribute to the\r\nproject. If the model is a custom model, a new converter must\r\nbe implemented.
