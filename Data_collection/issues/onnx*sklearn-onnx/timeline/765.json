my use case it is simply the inverse transform of one transformer.\r\n\r\nMy application, related to HVAC systems, transforms the data into the preprocessed domain, performs regression and transforms

the inverse coefficients of the `StandardScaler` (and one for `MinMaxScaler`) and it does work, but it is not my proudest piece of code ;)\r\n\r\nFurthermore I would argue that applications that
