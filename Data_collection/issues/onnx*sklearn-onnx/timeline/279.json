Transforming raw data to preprocessed data can take time. To speed up training, I usually preprocess the raw data once and then train different models with the same preprocessed data. Once I have selected the best model for my problem, I create a scoring pipeline by piping the transformation and the model. By the way, most of the time the best solution is often an ensemble of models which I train separately and group together to generate a the score.\r\n\r\n> This is how you can score them:\r\n> sess = InferenceSession('m1.onnx')\r\n> r1 = sess.run(None, input_feed={'input': X_test.astype(np.float32)})\r\n> sess = InferenceSession('m2.onnx')\r\n> r2 = sess.run(None, input_feed={'input': r1[0].astype(np.float32)})\r\n> sess = InferenceSession('m3.onnx')\r\n> r3 = sess.run(None, input_feed={'input': r2[0].astype(np.float32)})\r\n\r\nThese lines of code help create the m3(m2(m1()))-scoring pipeline. However, I'll like to go one step further and save this pipeline to onnx format. That way, once it's built, I don't have to keep the piping script, I only have to reload the pipeline to make a prediction.
