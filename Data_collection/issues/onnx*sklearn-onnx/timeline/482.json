(https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/9808#issue-1057986666):\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen trying to get output predictions from an inference session with a model that uses the SKLearn Gaussian Process Regressor, I get the following error message:\r\n\r\nonnxruntime.capi.onnxruntime_pybind11_state.Fail: [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Non-zero status code returned while running Scan node. Name:'Sc_Scan' Status Message: Subgraph must have the shape set for all outputs but next_out did not.\r\n\r\nI initially thought this was an issue with the runtime, as the opset checks were fine.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n    OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10\r\n    ONNX Runtime installed from: pypi\r\n    ONNX Runtime version: 1.9.0\r\n    Python version: 3.7.9\r\n    SKLearn version: 1.0.1\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nTrain any model using sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor() and try to output predictions from onnxruntime inference session.\r\n\r\n    Describe steps/code to reproduce the behavior.\r\n    I first observed it when it was part of a stacking regressor model, but double checked it as a standalone as well. Here's a brief script to reproduce:\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\r\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor as GPR\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\r\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\r\nimport onnxruntime as rt\r\nfrom skl2onnx import convert_sklearn\r\nfrom skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType\r\n\r\n#Create and prepare data.\r\nn_samples, n_features = 10000, 10\r\nX, y = make_regression(n_samples, n_features)  \r\ntx1,vx1,ty1,vy1 = train_test_split(X, y)\r\n\r\n#Define model with scaling.\r\nmodel = GPR()\r\npipe = make_pipeline(MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1, 1)), model)\r\npipe.fit(tx1, ty1)\r\n\r\n#Convert to onnx and run predictions.\r\ninitial_type=[('data_in', FloatTensorType([None, X.shape[1]]))]\r\nonx = convert_sklearn(pipe, initial_types=initial_type)\r\nsess = rt.InferenceSession(onx.SerializeToString())\r\npred_ort = sess.run(None, {'data_in': vx1.astype(np.float32)})[0]\r\n\r\n#Show output for comparison.\r\nprint(pred_ort[:10])\r\nprint(vy1[:10])\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis should output both predicted and actual values for comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
