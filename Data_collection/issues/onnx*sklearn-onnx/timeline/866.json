With scikit-learn, we could translate the onnx graph into a python code using numpy to compute the output. But i guess that's not what you meant. Onnx introduced functions. We could probably use one function for every model in a pipeline and let the main onnx graph call them as scikit-learn does in a pipeline. But that would require a significant code change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/1140972247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/1146663113","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/866#issuecomment-1146663113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/866","id":1146663113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCa0gS85EWLDJ","user":{"login":"lherbeur","id":5279518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzk1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5279518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur","html_url":"https://github.com/lherbeur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lherbeur/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-04T18:18:10Z","updated_at":"2022-06-04T18:18:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey,
