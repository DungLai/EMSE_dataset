couple of issues (#686, #608, #668) are related to the conversion of WOE encoder: the transformer checks if a feature belongs to a list of intervals (overlapping or not). This transformer is not part of scikit-learn and due to maintenance cost, this library only converts scikit-learn models. This PR introduces a custom transform and its associated converter hoping that example helps users raising issues about it.\r\n\r\nTwo converters are implemented, one using skl2onnx API, one using ONNX API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/912337620","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/686#issuecomment-912337620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/686","id":912337620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCa0gS842YSrU","user":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T07:54:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T07:55:04Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Let me know if PR #720 answers your need.
