Team,\r\n\r\nFound an issue similar to #476, but for sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier objects.\r\nAny model trained using an unsigned integer output type fails to be converted. See below a script to reproduce the issue:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\r\nfrom skl2onnx import convert_sklearn\r\nfrom skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType\r\n\r\nrettype = np.uint32\r\nnbclasses = 4\r\nnrattribs = 3\r\nnrpts = 10\r\n\r\nx_train = np.random.random_sample( (nrpts,nrattribs) ).astype( np.single )\r\ny_train = (x_train[:,0].copy() * nbclasses ).astype( rettype )\r\n\r\nmodel = MLPClassifier()\r\nmodel.fit( x_train, y_train )\r\n\r\ninitial_type = [('float_input', FloatTensorType([None,nrattribs]))]\r\nonnxmodel = convert_sklearn(model, initial_types=initial_type)\r\n```\r\nThe conversion fails for rettype = np.uint8, np.uint16 and np.uint32, but not for signed integer types or floating-point types.\r\nA workaround can be to modify the model output type after training, before calling convert_sklearn:\r\n`model.classes_ = model.classes_.astype( np.int32 )`\r\n\r\nTested with Python 3.9, scikit-learn v1.0.1, skl2onnx v1.10.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kn1kn1","id":1257349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTczNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1257349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1","html_url":"https://github.com/kn1kn1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kn1kn1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-25T06:42:50Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T06:42:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/946","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/946/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/946/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/946/events","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/946","id":1464105097,"node_id":"I_kwDOCa0gS85XRHiJ","number":946,"title":"'numpy.bool_'
