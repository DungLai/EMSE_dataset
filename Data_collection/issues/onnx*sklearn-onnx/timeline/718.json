What was the error you got?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply, @xadupre. I can put together a reproducible example next week but my current guess is that it doesn't check for the ONNX names of the input variables (because those occupied the name it tried to unreserve).\r\n\r\nWith regards to the error message, this is what happened:\r\n\r\nThe final error is thrown in `topological_operator_iterator`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/314cd07c19a78597c15c2ea10862b4e5d4318aa5/skl2onnx/common/_topology.py#L1017-L1030\r\n\r\nWhich is thrown because not all input variables of any operator are `is_fed`, so no evaluation happens:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/314cd07c19a78597c15c2ea10862b4e5d4318aa5/skl2onnx/common/_topology.py#L930-L931\r\n\r\nThat happens because something goes wrong in `_initialize_graph_status_for_traversing` or to be more precise in `unordered_variable_iterator`: Since one operator contains an input variable that is not part of `Scope.variables` anymore, this variable is not yielded by `unordered_variable_iterator` and hence `is_fed` is never set (in fact it was still set to `None`).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/314cd07c19a78597c15c2ea10862b4e5d4318aa5/skl2onnx/common/_topology.py#L1084-L1090\r\n\r\nHope this makes some sense.

However, `scope.temp().variables` does not equal `scope.variables`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> scope.variables\r\n{'input': Variable(raw_name='input', onnx_name='input', type=Int64TensorType(shape=[None]))}\r\n>>> scope.temp().variables\r\n{}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's why `_parse_sklearn(scope.temp(), model, inputs, custom_parsers=custom_parsers)` produces an output variable that's with an ONNX name that's already taken:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> _parse_sklearn(scope.temp(), model, inputs, custom_parsers=custom_parsers)\r\n[Variable(raw_name='input', onnx_name='input', type=Int64TensorType(shape=[None]))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas `_parse_sklearn(scope, model, inputs, custom_parsers=custom_parsers)` does not:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> _parse_sklearn(scope, model, inputs, custom_parsers=custom_parsers)\r\n[Variable(raw_name='input', onnx_name='input1', type=Int64TensorType(shape=[None]))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe we should use something like `deepcopy(scope)` here instead of `scope.temp()`?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/f33fc0012b280406a18a5bdb9a03de2c2e4f251d/skl2onnx/_parse.py#L554-L555\r\n\r\nI also think that we should add the `onnx_name` and not the `raw_name` to the `reserved` list. That is because I don't see how we can assume that the `raw_name` is unique and not already taken in the

When you say 'variable names', do you mean the `raw_name` property or the `onnx_name` property? I agree that `onnx_name`s have to be unique but I don't believe `raw_names`s have to. I also don't think this is a constraint in `sklearn-onnx` because we can declare several variables with the same `raw_name` and the `get_unique_variable_name` will create unique `onnx_name`s:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/2fd16a0053042030f135d1c3ae43fc999eb61f92/skl2onnx/common/_topology.py#L630-L637\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand why suddenly this would be an issue if one of the variables happened to be in input. Maybe you could help me out here. 🙁 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/908965289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janjagusch","id":25852654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODUyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25852654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch","html_url":"https://github.com/janjagusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janjagusch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5230522299,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIzMDUyMjI5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5230522299","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T07:14:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5230522308,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMzA1MjIzMDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5230522308","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T07:14:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/909031195","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/718#issuecomment-909031195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/718","id":909031195,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCa0gS842Lrcb","user":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-31T08:45:03Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T09:54:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"There was no test about input and output sharing the same raw_names.
