I don't think DictVectorizer supports having different key types either:\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer\r\n\r\ndict1 = [\r\n    {0: -0.3, 1: 3.1, 2: 2.1, 3: 5.6, 'city': 'London'},\r\n    {0: 1.3, 1: 3.1, 2: 2.1, 3: 5.6, 'city': 'Paris'},\r\n]\r\nDictVectorizer(sparse=False).fit_transform(dict1)\r\n\r\nTypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'\r\n\r\nYou could, however, make all the keys as string and have different types of values. For example:\r\ndict1 = [\r\n    {'0': -0.3, '1': 3.1, '2': 2.1, '3': 5.6, 'city': 'London'},\r\n    {'0': 1.3, '1': 3.1, '2': 2.1, '3': 5.6, 'city': 'Paris'},\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis should work with Scikit, but currently doesn't work with sklearn-onnx as DictionaryType expects a single value type. Perhaps, this could be fixed by accepting a list of value types in DictionaryType. I'll look into this.
