In practice we only use `novelty=False` and then we have constant `negative_outlier_factor_` as the score for the training points. In this sense the training of our LOF models is also our classification step. This is quite different than the usual paradigm. That is usually:\r\n\r\n`data set` --> `model` = `trained_model`\r\n\r\nthen\r\n\r\n`new data point` --> `trained_model` = `prediction` and/or `anomaly_score`\r\n\r\nOur LOF setup\r\n\r\n`data set` --> `model` = `predictionS` and/or `anomaly_scoreS`\r\n\r\nI think this might be possible with an `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` if it is possible to expose `fit_predict()`. i.e. in Python\r\n\r\n```\r\nclassifier_lof = LocalOutlierFactor(contamination='auto', novelty=False)\r\n# Use LOF to classfy the data\r\nabm_mask = classifier_lof.fit_predict(A) == -1 # LOF does training and classification in the same step\r\nscores = -1 * classifier_lof.negative_outlier_factor_ # this gives us the scores for the predictions\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote with `novelty=False`, there won't be a `score_samples()` option.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/926999548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"penguinyaro","id":15057517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU3NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15057517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro","html_url":"https://github.com/penguinyaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5359031757,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCa0gS847ZkDEzwAAAAE_bFXN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5359031757","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-25T02:52:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5359031758,"node_id":"SE_lADOCa0gS847ZkDEzwAAAAE_bFXO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5359031758","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-25T02:52:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5364672267,"node_id":"REE_lADOCa0gS847ZkDEzwAAAAE_wmcL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5364672267","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T10:47:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5364672306,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOCa0gS847ZkDEzwAAAAE_wmcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5364672306","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github

trainable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/931403630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/931600166","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/736#issuecomment-931600166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/736","id":931600166,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCa0gS843hxcm","user":{"login":"penguinyaro","id":15057517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU3NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15057517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro","html_url":"https://github.com/penguinyaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penguinyaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T19:24:06Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T19:24:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Either
