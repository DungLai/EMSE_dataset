I compared with this unit test [test_pipeline_column_transformer_titanic](https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/blob/master/tests/test_sklearn_pipeline.py#L287). It turns out that the type of pclass is wrong. It is trained assuming it is an integer, but it is converted assuming it is a string in the example but an integer in the unit test. onnxruntime does not check that the array it receives does not match onnx input schema and probably interprets the string pointer as an int. The model still gives results which look ok because the onehotencoder replaces the values for this column by the same integer categories. That also explains why the results are different at every run.
