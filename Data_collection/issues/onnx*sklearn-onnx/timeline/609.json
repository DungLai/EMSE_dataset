It should be easier if the custom function could be directly written with onnx operators. That's one option : write the custom function with ONNX operators. The second option is to convert that function into a python operator onnxruntime can use. That's what is done by the package [ort-customops](https://github.com/microsoft/ort-customops). Both ways would probably require examples to guide users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/774459895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4836472519,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQ0ODM2NDcyNTE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/4836472519","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-03T09:29:54Z","project_card":{"id":62391561,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/62391561","project_id":12598971,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/12598971","column_name":"To
