Why does [sklearn-onnx](https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx) not declare a compatible version of protobuf as a dependency? We have skl2onnx pinned to version 1.11.1, but still encountered this issue. Specifically including `protobuf=\"3.19\"` in our pipfile doesn't seem to resolve the issue. skl2onnx  seems to be relying on `google.protobuf`, I'm not clear if this is an alias for `protobuf` or a different package.
