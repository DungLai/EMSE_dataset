One reason for it being this way is that Coreml output is zipmap-like schema, and one of the main goals at that time was to be fully compatible with Coreml. e.g. skl.model -> coreml.model ->onnxml == skl.model->onnxml. At this moment, this behaviour would be difficult to change as it would violate Windows backward compatibility, and the huge test case suite that would need to be updated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/505413568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"prabhat00155","id":7043157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDMxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7043157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhat00155","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhat00155/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/505416405","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/202#issuecomment-505416405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/202","id":505416405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTQxNjQwNQ==","user":{"login":"maxnoe","id":5488440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODg0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5488440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe","html_url":"https://github.com/maxnoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T12:10:48Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T12:10:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How
