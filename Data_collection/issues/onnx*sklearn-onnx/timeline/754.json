the bug**\r\nI am using the onnxruntime-node npm package to attempt to run my onnx model.

and Distribution: Mac OS 11.3\r\n- ONNX Runtime-Node version: 1.8.0\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- Below shows the JS code running the model and how the model was created in Python\r\n\r\n***JS Code***\r\n```bash\r\n const ort = require('onnxruntime-node')\r\n\r\n const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create('./test.onnx')\r\n\r\n const dataA = Float32Array.from([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

created***\r\n```bash\r\nfrom skl2onnx import convert_sklearn\r\nfrom skl2onnx.common.data_types import FloatTensorType\r\nimport onnxruntime as rt\r\n\r\ninitial_type = [('float_input',
