What's the most canonical way of doing: \r\n- Cut the onnx graph before the threshold operation (in Python) and then export the Serialized model. \r\n- Or adapt sklearn-onnx to export decision_function instead (or both) of full predict function  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/1049682508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"julien-blanchon","id":11278197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjc4MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11278197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon","html_url":"https://github.com/julien-blanchon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julien-blanchon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/1049693518","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/833#issuecomment-1049693518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/833","id":1049693518,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCa0gS84-kQ1O","user":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-24T10:10:48Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T10:10:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Short term solution: you can check the list of available options for all converters here: https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/auto_tutorial/plot_dbegin_options.html#list-of-available-options.
