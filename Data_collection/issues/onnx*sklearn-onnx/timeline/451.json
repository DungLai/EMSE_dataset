at this list, I'm thinking about something else since we could end up with many options in many converters to prevent a converter from using a specific list of operators. I'll do something about it next week then. The converter code would have to be updated the same way but you would know at converting time if a converter fails using only operators in the list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/622024887/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/622031491","html_url":"https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/451#issuecomment-622031491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/451","id":622031491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjAzMTQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"alexivaner","id":57290644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjkwNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57290644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner","html_url":"https://github.com/alexivaner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexivaner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T18:42:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T18:42:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@xadupre Okay, thank you for already put this in the to do list.
