One custom operator is implemented by onnxruntime and uses re2 to split a string into words. This option is supported by sklearn-onnx. There might be discrepencies as sklearn uses package re to tokenizer (re2 and re are not exactly the same).\r\n\r\nOther tokenizers are implemented in [onnxruntime-extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions) (see [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions/blob/main/docs/custom_text_ops.md#tokenizer)). For the time being, it would be difficult to insert one of these classifier in a scikit-learn pipeline and then convert it into ONNX (it is implemented unless you write your own converter).\r\n\r\nLet us know if this kind of features would be interesting for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/comments/872141968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5676783849,"node_id":"LE_lADOCa0gS843NGsKzwAAAAFSXNjp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onnx/sklearn-onnx/issues/events/5676783849","actor":{"login":"xadupre","id":22452781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUyNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22452781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre","html_url":"https://github.com/xadupre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xadupre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-26T10:15:14Z","label":{"name":"feature request","color":"EBBE89"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
