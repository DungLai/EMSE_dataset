R","body":"Hi @liangzimei , I tested out below two scenarios with latest master branch of tensorflow serving [repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving). \r\n\r\n*NOTE:* Currently master branch is broken with `builtin` modules missing error. Ebi, created a [patch](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/pull/1367) to fix it. So it did use patch to build docker images.\r\n\r\n### Clone Tensorflow Serving\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:tensorflow/serving.git\r\ncd serving\r\ngit pull origin pull/1367/head\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build MKL-DNN Docker images and Test\r\nI followed instructions from [here](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/docs/general/tensorflow_serving/InstallationGuide.md#example-serving-resnet-50-v1-model) to test `ResNet50-V1` model. \r\n\r\n1. Build image\r\n```\r\ncd tensorflow_serving/tools/docker\r\n\r\ndocker build \\\r\n    --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY} \\\r\n    --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY} \\\r\n    --build-arg http_proxy=${http_proxy} \\\r\n    --build-arg https_proxy=${https_proxy} \\\r\n    -f Dockerfile.devel-mkl -t tensorflow/serving:latest-devel-mkl .\r\n\r\ndocker build \\\r\n--build-arg HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY} \\\r\n--build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY} \\\r\n--build-arg http_proxy=${http_proxy} \\\r\n--build-arg https_proxy=${https_proxy} \\\r\n-f Dockerfile.mkl -t tensorflow/serving:mkl .\r\n\r\n```\r\n2. Get NCHW pre-trained model\r\n\r\n_NOTE: NCHW data format is optimal for Intel-optimized TensorFlow Serving._\r\n```\r\nmkdir /tmp/resnet\r\n\r\ncurl -s http://download.tensorflow.org/models/official/20181001_resnet/savedmodels/resnet_v1_fp32_savedmodel_NCHW_jpg.tar.gz \\\r\n| tar --strip-components=2 -C /tmp/resnet -xvz\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run Tensorflow model server for the downloaded model using built image\r\nTested on machine with `2-sockets and 28 cores each`. Below is the optimal configuration for this model. Setting 1/4th of physical cores gave optimal performance.\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  -p 8501:8501 \\\r\n  --name=tfserving_resnet_restapi \\\r\n  -v \"/tmp/resnet:/models/resnet\" \\\r\n  -e OMP_NUM_THREADS=14 \\\r\n  -e TENSORFLOW_INTER_OP_PARALLELISM=2 \\\r\n  -e TENSORFLOW_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM=14 \\\r\n  -e MODEL_NAME=resnet \\\r\n  tensorflow/serving:mkl &\r\n```\r\n4. Download client and Send predict requests\r\n\r\nDownload client\r\n```\r\n curl -o /tmp/resnet/resnet_client.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/serving/master/tensorflow_serving/example/resnet_client.py\r\n```\r\nSend Request\r\n```\r\n for i in {1..10};do python /tmp/resnet/resnet_client.py; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Result:**\r\n```\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 43.8565 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 43.6785 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 45.0794 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 44.5519 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 44.6467 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 44.8927 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 45.3638 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 44.973 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 45.6599 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 45.21 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build Eigen Docker images and Test\r\n\r\nI followed same instructions as above. Only change is we used `NHWC` data format with Eigen\r\n\r\n1. Build images\r\n```\r\ndocker build \\\r\n    --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY} \\\r\n    --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY} \\\r\n    --build-arg http_proxy=${http_proxy} \\\r\n    --build-arg https_proxy=${https_proxy} \\\r\n    -f Dockerfile.devel -t tensorflow/serving:latest-devel .\r\n\r\ndocker build \\\r\n--build-arg HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY} \\\r\n--build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY} \\\r\n--build-arg http_proxy=${http_proxy} \\\r\n--build-arg https_proxy=${https_proxy} \\\r\n-f Dockerfile -t tensorflow/serving:eigen .\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Get pretrained model\r\n```\r\nmkdir /tmp/resnet2 \r\n\r\ncurl -s http://download.tensorflow.org/models/official/20181001_resnet/savedmodels/resnet_v1_fp32_savedmodel_NHWC_jpg.tar.gz \\\r\n| tar --strip-components=2 -C /tmp/resnet2 -xvz\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run docker container, before start container make sure to stop previous container.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker rm -f tfserving_resnet_restapi\r\n\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  -p 8501:8501 \\\r\n  --name=tfserving_resnet_restapi \\\r\n  -v \"/tmp/resnet2:/models/resnet\" \\\r\n  -e MODEL_NAME=resnet \\\r\n  tensorflow/serving:eigen &\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n4. Send Request\r\n```\r\nfor i in {1..10};do python /tmp/karthik/git-repo/tfserving/resnet/resnet_client.py; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Result**\r\n```\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 79.6406 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 77.7406 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 72.6479 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 71.69 ms\r\nPrediction class: 286, avg latency: 74.3118
