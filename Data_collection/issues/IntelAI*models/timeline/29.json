These containers have all the code, dependency installs, and pretrained models needed to run the inference and accuracy scripts. All that you'll need to provide is the [preprocessed COCO dataset](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/tree/master/datasets/coco) and an output directory where log files will be written. The links above have instructions on how to run the containers for accuracy and inference. I ran these scripts for both FP32 and Int8 (both accuracy and inference scripts) to verify that they are working. The containers have \"quick start scripts\" (which are described in the docs), which make it easier to run common use cases. If you want to call the launch_benchmark.py script with your own args, you can still do that by giving the `python benchmarks/launch_benchmark.py ...` command instead of the quickstart script in the docker run command. For more information on how to do this, please see the [advanced container usages documentation](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/quickstart/common/tensorflow/ModelPackagesAdvancedOptions.md#docker).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/comments/754279122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmsuehir","id":13952606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir","html_url":"https://github.com/dmsuehir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4361567193,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0MzYxNTY3MTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/events/4361567193","actor":{"login":"dmsuehir","id":13952606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir","html_url":"https://github.com/dmsuehir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-22T19:38:42Z","assignee":{"login":"dmsuehir","id":13952606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir","html_url":"https://github.com/dmsuehir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/comments/849931670","html_url":"https://github.com/IntelAI/models/issues/29#issuecomment-849931670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/29","id":849931670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTkzMTY3MA==","user":{"login":"dmsuehir","id":13952606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir","html_url":"https://github.com/dmsuehir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsuehir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-27T20:48:46Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T20:48:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing
