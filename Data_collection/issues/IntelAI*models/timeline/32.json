This container has all the code, dependency code/installs, and pretrained models that are needed to run the model. All that you'll need to provide is the path to the [preprocessed COCO dataset](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/tree/master/datasets/coco) and an output directory where the log files will be written. The container also includes quick start scripts for common use cases. In your case, you can use the [`fp32_accuracy.sh`](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/quickstart/object_detection/tensorflow/ssd-resnet34/inference/fp32/fp32_accuracy.sh) script, which is using the same parameters mentioned above (like batch size 1, socket 0, and accuracy only). \r\n\r\nHere's an example of how the container can be used to run the accuracy test for SSD-ResNet32:\r\n```\r\nDATASET_DIR=/home/user/coco/output\r\nOUTPUT_DIR=/home/user/logs\r\n\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  --env DATASET_DIR=${DATASET_DIR} \\\r\n  --env OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR} \\\r\n  --volume ${DATASET_DIR}:${DATASET_DIR} \\\r\n  --volume ${OUTPUT_DIR}:${OUTPUT_DIR} \\\r\n  --privileged --init -t \\\r\n  intel/object-detection:tf-2.3.0-imz-2.2.0-ssd-resnet34-fp32-inference \\\r\n  /bin/bash quickstart/fp32_accuracy.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to not use the quickstart script or would like to call the launch_benchmark.py with different args, you can use the above command with `python benchmarks/launch_benchmark.py ...` instead of `/bin/bash quickstart/fp32_accuracy.sh`. For more information, please see the [model container advanced usages documentation
