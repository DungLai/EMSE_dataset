It would look something like:\r\n`docker run <intel-image-name> \r\n-e intra_op_parallelism=2 \r\n-e inter_op_parallelism=2\r\n-e OMP_NUM_THREADS=2\r\n-e KMP_BLOCKTIME=1` \r\n\r\nAnother thing to note here is, although you can assign specific cpu's for a container and run parallel containers at the same time it doesn't necessarily guarantee a performance improvement. Because, the resources are being constrained and the training might take longer than when it's using the entire system with shared cores.\r\n\r\nThe values you have set for intra_op/inter_op, OMP_NUM_THREADS etc. are based on the machine we have initially tested and those were the best known configurations that worked. However, as your hardware specs change these numbers should also change. \r\n\r\nCheck this link for more information about what each of those env variables mean and what values they need to be set to as per your hardware configuration:
