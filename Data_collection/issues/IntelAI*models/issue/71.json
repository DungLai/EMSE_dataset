Following this guide https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/docs/general/tensorflow_serving/InstallationGuide.md with `2.4.0` instead of `2.3.0`, the docker build successfully passes the build of tensorflow serving... but later results in errors when trying to copy the library files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncannot stat '/root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/*/external/mkl_linux/lib/*': No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nI can't seem to find the produced lib files anywhere in the intermediate containers.\r\n\r\nAny insight?","closed_by":{"login":"ashahba","id":12436063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2MDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba","html_url":"https://github.com/ashahba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashahba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
