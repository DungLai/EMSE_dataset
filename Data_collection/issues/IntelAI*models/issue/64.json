Interestingly, the training managed to finish with `bf16`, though the performance was much worse than `fp32`. I also did a similar test for `fp16`, whose performance was also worse than `fp32`. Since the CPU does not support `fp16` or `bf16`, I am very interested to know how TensorFlow handles such situation.","closed_by":{"login":"zhao1157","id":12959339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157","html_url":"https://github.com/zhao1157","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhao1157/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IntelAI/models/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
