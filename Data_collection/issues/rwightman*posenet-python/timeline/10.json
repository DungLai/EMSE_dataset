Ross , @rwightman .  I have a question. \r\n\r\n- The `pose_keypoint_coords` is a `10x17x2 ` 3d matrix. I could manage to modify and filter out the \r\n   array by defining an array `pose_keypoint_coords_modifed` I trued to return the \r\n  `keypoints_coords_,modified ` but it returned an error \r\n ```\r\n   s = np.sum((exist_pose_coords - keypoint_coords) ** 2, axis=2) > squared_nms_radius\r\n   ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (1,16,2) (17,2) \r\n ```\r\nI guess i have to do , reshape it to a matrix `16x2` before retruning that in the fucntion. \r\n\r\n-  If i understand it correctly the keypoints currently arranged are in the order \r\n```\r\n    x,0,y0 --> nose \r\n    x1,y1 ----> left eye\r\n    x2,y2 ----> Right eye \r\n    ........\r\n    x16,y16\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n-  In the file `webcam_demo.py`  The pose_decode function `posenet.decode_multi.decode_multiple_poses`  is executed per frame right ? Every frame in the video the `posenet` model  right ?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\n-   Another question I have is , that if i want to , do modfications of  `keypoint_coords` , per frame. I can do perhaps something like \r\n   `keypoint_coords[frame_count]` \r\nand save it , to a file for each frame ?
