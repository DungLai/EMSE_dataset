I did notice that performance falls off significantly with low dynamic range (noisy, low-light images). You can try to fiddle with the thresholds, filter the images, apply gain, etc. Overall though it's a performance optimized solution. Some of the other solutions with more capable models and tracking will likely handle more people and more adverse imaging conditions better but at the cost of much higher compute requirements. Good luck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/473108984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2205134478,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNTEzNDQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/events/2205134478","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T23:56:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
