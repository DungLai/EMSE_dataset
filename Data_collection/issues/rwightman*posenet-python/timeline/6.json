These frame based pose algorithms suffer from frame to frame glitches and disappearance/reappearance of the parts or person that are quite noticeable for video sequences. Additionally there is no identifier for each detection that remains constant from frame to frame if you're doing analytics.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't see the value for saving compute. If you're running the base CNN on any sort of GPU I imagine it would be much faster than pixel based tracking algorithms running on a CPU. The forward pass through the CNN is 3-5ms on a decent GPU, faster than the Python post processing code for NMS and traversal of the parts for scoring. I can't see any pixel based tracking algorithm being better than that, it's likely several times worse. If you're running the NN on a CPU, there might be some benefit but seems like it'd be a wash.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/469524428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/470427222","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/6#issuecomment-470427222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/6","id":470427222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDQyNzIyMg==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T08:10:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T08:10:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, thanks, but there are any way of knowing if the person has disapeared, I though of doing a general mean of all the points and track that one to know if the person is there or has moved, also I thought of doing the same for head, chest and arms.

The score is used to evaluate whether each part is valid for each detection.\r\n\r\nFor the actual poses though, there is no consistent ordering from frame to frame in terms of which pose corresponds to which person you're hoping to track. The tracking algorithm needs to perform that matching reliably for the unique ids to work. I'd make sure your tracking bbox includes the whole person in each detection to provide enough features for the tracking detector to work. You'd also want to improve the matching of new CNN parts detection to existing tracking detections. Maybe calculate centroid distances or bbox overlap volumes and use greedy matching of smallest distance or biggest overlap vol.\r\n\r\nYou could search github and other places for solutions to the tracking part of the PostTrack (https://posetrack.net/leaderboard.php) challenge... see if you can find any code for the multi-frame part that would mesh well with these sorts of part detections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/470610343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2300678242,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwMDY3ODI0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/events/2300678242","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-25T15:43:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
