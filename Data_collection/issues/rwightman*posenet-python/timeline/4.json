My hunch is it'll be a minimal gain but easy enough to try. I'll give it a shot sometime this week.\r\n\r\nOn my PyTorch version of this I achieved an extra 10-20fps (and much less CPU use) by keeping the part scoring on the GPU using max_pool and some other torch ops... I didn't want to fiddle with doing that in TF graph land so it's not in this port. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/459050827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2114542483,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxMTQ1NDI0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/events/2114542483","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"36426c52ed040a95b30863fe0bdc32b3db9ae528","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/commits/36426c52ed040a95b30863fe0bdc32b3db9ae528","created_at":"2019-02-03T22:35:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/460095644","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/4#issuecomment-460095644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/4","id":460095644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDA5NTY0NA==","user":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-03T22:37:25Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T22:37:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Didn't appear to have a major impact.
