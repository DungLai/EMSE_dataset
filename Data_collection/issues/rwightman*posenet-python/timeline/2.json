I had wanted to throw something in for that, but it's non-trivial and I've had other priorities. If I tackle it someday it'll likely be in the PyTorch version that I made.\r\n\r\nThe paper that Google's impl was based on is: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08225  ... you can get an idea of what training would involve from that\r\n\r\nMicrosoft released a recent human pose estimatgion model with training code: https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch ... based on their 'only tested with 4 P100 GPUs', it's likely a fair bit more resource intensive than these models. However, some ideas for training a smaller model could likely be gleaned from their code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/comments/457268694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2205135210,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNTEzNTIxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwightman/posenet-python/issues/events/2205135210","actor":{"login":"rwightman","id":5702664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5702664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman","html_url":"https://github.com/rwightman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwightman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T23:56:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
