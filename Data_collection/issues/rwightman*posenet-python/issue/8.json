Going trough the code I realize that there are a variable \"max_pose_detections\" in the decode_multi to define the maximum number of people detected. There is a way of improving the detection of people to detect more, as changing the illumination or contrast of the image. I suppose that this problem can be partially solve using a training with data created and labeled to that case of use.\r\n\r\nAlso if there is a way of differentiating people very close from another, as when people are very close there a many times when it combines the points as it is one person.
