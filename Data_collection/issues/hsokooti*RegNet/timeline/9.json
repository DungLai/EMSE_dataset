About the stitching issue, is the attached DVF obtained from the decimation3 network?\r\nUnfortunately,  I do not have any DVF samples from the decimation3 network in the meantime. However, I checked the results of [decimation4](https://github.com/hsokooti/RegNet/blob/master/functions/RegNetModel/decimation4.py) network and apparently there is no issue in the stitching process:\r\n![Sample DVF_s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12530760/64713496-4438ee80-d4bd-11e9-9fc7-ae48331eac7a.png)\r\nThe input size of this network is 105 and the output size is 21. It is possible to increase the input/output size with a multiple of 4 at the test time. \r\n\r\n2. Your point is completely true.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/530448906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hsokooti","id":12530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/530614527","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/9#issuecomment-530614527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/9","id":530614527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDYxNDUyNw==","user":{"login":"cs123951","id":13451757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDUxNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13451757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951","html_url":"https://github.com/cs123951","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T00:20:41Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T00:20:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your rapid reply!
