Only the index coordinate will change. \r\n\r\nIf your landmarks are in the index coordinate, you can convert them to the world coordinate before resampling, for example by `sitk::Image::TransformIndexToPhysicalPoint()`. After performing the resampling then these physical points can be converted back to indices: `sitk::Image::TransformPhysicalPointToIndex()`. \r\n\r\nFor more info, you can check some examples on the [SimpleITK tutorial](https://simpleitk-prototype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/plot_image.html)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/651375491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hsokooti","id":12530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/654490660","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/10#issuecomment-654490660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/10","id":654490660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDQ5MDY2MA==","user":{"login":"hsokooti","id":12530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T22:10:35Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T22:10:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I guess it makes the pipeline much straight-forward, but it is not necessary.
