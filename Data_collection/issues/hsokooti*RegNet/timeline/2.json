Indeed, you are right that this version of the code is not very readable. I've updated most parts of the code. I'll try to merge them here as soon as possible. Any suggestions about the code are really welcome and I would appreciate it. You might contact me by [email](https://www.lumc.nl/org/radiologie/medewerkers/1026263?setlanguage=English&setcountry=en).  \r\n\r\nThe difference between the function blob() and smooth() is that in blob() the Guassian blob have (almost) no overlap. At this version, the DeformedArea can only be used for debugging. Previously, it was used to force that all samples were chosen in this area to avoid having many zero displacement vector field in the training/validation phase.
