About the extension, you can define it for your own database in the `setting_utils.py`. For example,  in line 88, this is defined for the DIR-Lab_4D:\r\n```python\r\n    elif selected_data == 'DIR-Lab_4D':\r\n        data_setting['Dim'] = '3D'\r\n        data_setting['ext'] = '.mha'\r\n        data_setting['imageByte'] = 2              # equals to sitk.sitkInt16 , we prefer not to import sitk in SettingUtils\r\n        data_setting['types'] = ['T00', 'T10', 'T20', 'T30', 'T40', 'T50', 'T60', 'T70', 'T80', 'T90']     # for eg: 'Fixed' or 'Moving' : actually Fixed indicates baseline and Moving indicates followup\r\n        data_setting['expPrefix'] = 'case'         # for eg: case1\r\n        data_setting['defaultPixelValue'] = -2048  # The pixel value when a transformed pixel is outside of the image\r\n        data_setting['voxelSize'] = [1, 1, 1]\r\n        data_setting['AffineRegistration'] = True\r\n        data_setting['UnsureLandmarkAvailable'] = False\r\n        data_setting['CNList'] = [i for i in range(1, 11)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo check all addresses, I suggest running and testing the following line:\r\n```python\r\noriginal_image_address = su.address_generator(setting, 'originalIm', data='DIR-Lab_4D', cn=1, type_im=0, stage=1)\r\n```\r\nI hope that this can help.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/436777852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hsokooti","id":12530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/437076701","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/7#issuecomment-437076701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/7","id":437076701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzA3NjcwMQ==","user":{"login":"markemus","id":28574774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTc0Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28574774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus","html_url":"https://github.com/markemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-08T16:59:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T16:59:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Very helpful, thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/comments/437076701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"markemus","id":28574774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTc0Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28574774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus","html_url":"https://github.com/markemus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markemus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
