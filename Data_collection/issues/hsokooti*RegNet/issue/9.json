From the function “next_sweep_patch()” in functions.reading.real_pair, it seems that you get patches from image pair, and then concatenate these patches to form DVF. But this is easy to generate wrong correspondings between adjacent DVF. i.e. It's obvious that there are traces between patches in the final DVF. Like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13451757/64683762-798e0e00-d4b6-11e9-9170-f53d0719a2ca.png)\r\n\r\nHow to solve this problem? \r\n\r\n2.  The input size in Function.RegNetModel.decimation3 is (155,155,155) and the output size is (27,27,27,3). Then the output is the DVF for the center part (27,27,27) in (155,155,155)?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot if you could answer my doubts.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cs123951","id":13451757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDUxNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13451757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951","html_url":"https://github.com/cs123951","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs123951/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
