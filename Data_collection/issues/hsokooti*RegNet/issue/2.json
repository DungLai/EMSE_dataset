I have read your paper and it looks interesting... hence I would like to replicate it myself. However I do notice that (IMO) your code can be improved. Both in terms of readability as well as reduction in redundancy. Since I want to help to improve it, I would like to offer my suggestions. However I don't know how to 'post' these.. are you able to help me with that?\r\n\r\nBesides that I have, for now, one question that I want to ask. In the script where you create synthetic DVFs, there is a option for blob() and smooth(). Both create a DVFb, but blob(), in addition, creates an DeformedArea surface.\r\nAs far as I could tell, the DVFb is introduced to transform one set of images to a transformed version. This fixed and moved image are then used to train the model.\r\nHowever, I cant find where the DeformedArea object is used again. I believe you do show an image of that in the README.md, but I don't see that it transform some original image like DVFb does. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hsokooti","id":12530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti","html_url":"https://github.com/hsokooti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsokooti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hsokooti/RegNet/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
