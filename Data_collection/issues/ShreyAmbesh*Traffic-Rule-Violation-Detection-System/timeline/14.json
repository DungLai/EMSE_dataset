This can be fixed by scheduling all the request at particular intervals and using a queue or eliminating the openalpr and making your own custom solution for detecting License Plate and License Plate Number.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ShreyAmbesh/Traffic-Rule-Violation-Detection-System/issues/comments/510602229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ShreyAmbesh","id":31286953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjg2OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31286953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyAmbesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2476871457,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ3Njg3MTQ1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ShreyAmbesh/Traffic-Rule-Violation-Detection-System/issues/events/2476871457","actor":{"login":"ShreyAmbesh","id":31286953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjg2OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31286953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyAmbesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyAmbesh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-11T18:31:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
