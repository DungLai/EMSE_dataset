As far as I know, Python3 itself has the module with the name ```parser```. I changed the file name of ```parser.py``` to some other names, and then it works. Hope to change the name. \r\n\r\nthis is a screenshot (sorry, this is another repo's)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37621591/65399160-b37fde00-dded-11e9-9038-c9bf3721086f.png)\r\n\r\nand this is the description of that. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37621591/65399204-df02c880-dded-11e9-8e50-1917e080b535.png)\r\n\r\nchange the name of the file, and then it works. (no GPU version is running...)\r\n\r\n? I guess that you are using Python 2.7, instead of Python 3. (sorry, i am now using Microsoft Windows for example, I remembered that when I use Ubuntu to run the same code several months ago, I have met the same problem... (I also use Python 3 in Ubuntu) \r\nAnd I hope ALL THE ```parser``` names can be changed. \r\n\r\nyours sincerely, \r\n@wmf1997. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/GraphWaveMachine/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/GraphWaveMachine/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
