Just another doubt, in the function sample_and_group, if the flag use_xyz is set to true, we have : new_points = tf.concat([grouped_xyz, grouped_points], axis=-1) # (batch_size, npoint, nample, 3+channel). To use XYZ values only, instead of setting (R,G,B) = (0,0,0), I was instead doing new_points = grouped_xyz which gives me significantly different results. I can't figure out why this creates that much of a difference as I was grouping X,Y,Z coordinates without the concatenated (R,G,B) = (0,0,0) values. Can you please help me with this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/comments/568163589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Shubhendu-Jena","id":12934176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTM0MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12934176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena","html_url":"https://github.com/Shubhendu-Jena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shubhendu-Jena/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
