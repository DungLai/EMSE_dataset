Was it done with 2048 points as in your FlyingThings3D training script or with 16384 points as with your KITTI evaluation script? I tried finetuning with 2048 points on KITTI and then evaluating with your KITTI evaluation script using 8192 points and the results become worse compared to what they were before finetuning. I'd be grateful if you could provide any inputs regarding the same. I'd be also grateful if you could share the script for converting point cloud into chunks for KITTI finetuning/evaluation.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
