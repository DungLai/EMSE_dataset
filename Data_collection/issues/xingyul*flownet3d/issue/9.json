I want to know what is the \"residual flow\" . Did you just estimate scene flow twice? And I want to know the detail of how to translate the scene flow into the rigid motion estimation, how you \" fit a rigid transformation from the point cloud 1 to the point cloud 2 + scene flow, as they have one-to-one correspondences \" ?
