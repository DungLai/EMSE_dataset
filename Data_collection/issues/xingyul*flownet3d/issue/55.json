Therefore if we only need the pointcloud data to use the network, I don't understand why need to input optical flow data and gt data to get the sceneflow in training and evaluation? I think maybe it turns optical flow and gt into the correct sceneflow and makes the sceneflow as the label to train and test. Am I correct? If it is incorrect, what is the funtion of input optical flow and gt?\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
