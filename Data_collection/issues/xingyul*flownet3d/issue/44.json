The average 3D EPE result is approximately 0.175m, better than what was reported in the paper\". However, this is true only for the dataset with ground points. However, your preprocessed dataset here is without ground points, for which the EPE mentioned in the paper is 0.122, much lower (better) than the EPE you're getting with the KITTI evaluation script. Please help me resolve this discrepancy. Is it that the dataset is with ground points or is there an issue with the KITTI evaluation script?\r\n\r\nBest Regards","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
