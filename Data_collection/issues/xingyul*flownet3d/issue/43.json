Am I doing something wrong? I've tried with models both trained from scratch as well as the pre-trained model given by you and I've used both cases when RGB values are used and when (R,G,B) = (0,0,0). Please let me know what might be the cause of this discrepancy. \r\n\r\nBest Regards","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
