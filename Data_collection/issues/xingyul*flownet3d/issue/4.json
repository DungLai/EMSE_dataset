I have trained the model and obtained close results to the paper on FlyingThings3D dataset. I have some problems. 1). How to visualize the scene flow like your paper? 2).  When will the training and test on the KITTI dataset be released? And, can you provide the pre-trained model? Thank you very much!\r\nBest,\r\nZhai","closed_by":{"login":"xingyul","id":25826644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODI2NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25826644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul","html_url":"https://github.com/xingyul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
