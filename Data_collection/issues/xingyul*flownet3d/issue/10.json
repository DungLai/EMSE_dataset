I tried again this code with the evaluation set from `FlyingThings3D`, that you provided, to verify that performance are unchanged.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to feed the network with point clouds (xyz + colors in [0, 1]) from `YCB` I am getting very weird results.\r\n\r\nAs an example consider the following two frames involving the `Cracker Box` object\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-16 12-21-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6014499/59562810-71e2d880-9031-11e9-816f-774a540bc469.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, the point clouds represent one of the faces of the box after it undergoes a small rotation. The rotation is such that the maximum change between points of the two frames is in the order of `~ 4cm` as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nWhen doing inference, the translation vectors from the frame on the left to the frame on the right are very strange and not compatible with that motion, something like\r\n```\r\n[[[-0.25203004 -0.04336617 -0.24234553]\r\n  [-0.25667757 -0.05793389 -0.23309565]\r\n  [-0.25017104 -0.03977326 -0.2452542 ]\r\n  ...\r\n  [-0.2619986  -0.07882687 -0.21964237]\r\n  [-0.26357266 -0.0843826  -0.21680456]\r\n  [-0.26159576 -0.07794474 -0.21985136]]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think the point clouds I am feeding to the network are too different from the data from the `FlyingThings3D` dataset such that the network is not able to generalize with a model trained on that dataset?\r\n\r\nAlso, I saw that, within the model `model_concat_upsa.py`, several `radiuses` are defined, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRADIUS1 = 0.5\r\nRADIUS2 = 1.0\r\nRADIUS3 = 2.0\r\nRADIUS4 = 4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nplus some other hardcoded radius like `radius = 5.0`,  `radius = 2.4`, `radius = 1.2` and `radius = 0.6` in the definitions of the layers.\r\n\r\nIn your experience, are these values critical for the network? In case I need to the re-train the network with point clouds, optical flow and colors from scenes involving small objects, e.g. from `YCB` dataset, should I care in selecting them carefully or they are general enough?\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the point clouds (xyz + colors) of the two frames (files `frame0.txt` and `frame1.txt`) and the results of the inference (file `predicted_val.txt`) obtained using the pre-trained model available in this repository.\r\n\r\nThank you for your availability.\r\n\r\n[frame0.txt](https://github.com/xingyul/flownet3d/files/3294039/frame0.txt)\r\n[frame1.txt](https://github.com/xingyul/flownet3d/files/3294040/frame1.txt)\r\n[predicted_val.txt](https://github.com/xingyul/flownet3d/files/3294041/predicted_val.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"xingyul","id":25826644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODI2NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25826644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul","html_url":"https://github.com/xingyul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingyul/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xingyul/flownet3d/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
