As for your questions:\r\n\r\n> I cannot see multiple plots?\r\n\r\nDo you mean multiple plots on one figure or logging multiple figures? For the former, each plot on the figure corresponds with one execution of your python script. For the latter, log the scalar with a different string name. \r\n\r\n> I can only see thoughts from another collection now, and new ones don't seem to get added?\r\n\r\nMy bad, forgot to add that feature. I have updated the master branch to include this.\r\n\r\n> When switching tabs, the plot becomes smaller, and can only be reset by deselecting and selecting the experiment?\r\n\r\nSo after a bit of playing around, I found this to be the case if you filter the table while the plots tab is not active. Haven't investigated this further though. I will leave this issue open for this bug.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes selecting multiple experiments for comparison results in only seeing the last selected experiment?\r\n\r\nShould be fixed now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbli/ml_board/issues/comments/412252395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bbli","id":28494324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDk0MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28494324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli","html_url":"https://github.com/bbli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbli/ml_board/issues/comments/412273415","html_url":"https://github.com/bbli/ml_board/issues/2#issuecomment-412273415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbli/ml_board/issues/2","id":412273415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI3MzQxNQ==","user":{"login":"222464","id":1609713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464","html_url":"https://github.com/222464","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/222464/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T12:56:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T12:56:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I will give these fixes a try!\r\n\r\n> Do you mean multiple plots on one figure or logging multiple figures?\r\n\r\nI logged two scalars under different names in one run, and the second one wouldn't display.
