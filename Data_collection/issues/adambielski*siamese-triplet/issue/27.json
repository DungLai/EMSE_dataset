Thanks for sharing such elegant codes.\r\n\r\nI have a  small question, in TripletMNIST(Dataset) class.  your annotation  about testsets is \"Test: Creates fixed triplets for testing\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in the code it is \r\n            triplets = [[i,\r\n                         random_state.choice(self.label_to_indices[self.test_labels[i].item()]),\r\n                         random_state.choice(self.label_to_indices[\r\n                                                 np.random.choice(\r\n                                                     list(self.labels_set - set([self.test_labels[i].item()]))\r\n                                                 )\r\n                                             ])\r\n                         ]\r\n\r\nI think it maybe should be the followings:\r\n\r\n            triplets = [[i,\r\n                         random_state.choice(self.label_to_indices[self.test_labels[i].item()]),\r\n                         random_state.choice(self.label_to_indices[\r\n                                                random_state.choice(\r\n                                                     list(self.labels_set - set([self.test_labels[i].item()]))\r\n                                                 )\r\n                                             ])\r\n                         ]\r\n\r\n\r\nI means use random_state.choice instead of np.random.choice of the original code, in order to create fixed testsets.\r\n\r\nI am not sure If I am right, can we discuss it?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
