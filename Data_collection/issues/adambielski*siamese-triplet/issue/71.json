I am using your custom sampler for a project of mine. I am currently using MNIST dataset loaded from torchvision. When I use your sampler I got the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Caught ValueError in DataLoader worker process 0.\r\nOriginal Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/worker.py\", line 287, in _worker_loop\r\n    data = fetcher.fetch(index)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/fetch.py\", line 49, in fetch\r\n    data = [self.dataset[idx] for idx in possibly_batched_index]\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/fetch.py\", line 49, in <listcomp>\r\n    data = [self.dataset[idx] for idx in possibly_batched_index]\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torchvision/datasets/mnist.py\", line 127, in __getitem__\r\n    img, target = self.data[index], int(self.targets[index])\r\nValueError: only one element tensors can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know what may be causing this error.
