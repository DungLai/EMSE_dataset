It turns out that even for simple MNIST classification network, the training cannot progress at all. It is true that ReLU imposes the additional constraint that only the positive quadrant can be used, but still it surprises me that the training loss stays at 2.3, which means nothing.\r\n\r\nDid you adopt PReLU as conscious choice and what was the rationale? Thank you so much.","closed_by":{"login":"w-hc","id":17956191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTU2MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17956191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc","html_url":"https://github.com/w-hc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w-hc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
