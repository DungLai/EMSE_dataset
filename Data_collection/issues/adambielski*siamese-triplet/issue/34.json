My experiments consist of extracting features for each image in the test dataset and using these features for the task of image retrieval. I'm saving the trained model, but I'm not able to load to extract the features of each image because the model is trained for a triplet format input. Some idea?","closed_by":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
