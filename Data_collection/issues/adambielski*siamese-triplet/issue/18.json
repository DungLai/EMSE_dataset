It turns out that it is because some of the distances equal to 0 (very unlikely to happen) and consequently the derivative sqrt(d) to d is nan. I added a small smooth constant to solve this problem and perhaps you should consider adding a smooth parameter too.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
