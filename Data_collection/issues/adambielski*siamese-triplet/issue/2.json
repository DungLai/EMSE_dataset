I am even more surprised that the online sampling with negative mining does not seem to perform better than random sampling?\r\nI understand you're using a 2d embedding space, but still. Do you have any quantitative numbers using maybe a higher dimensional space?\r\nCould be interesting to plot in 3D as well.","closed_by":{"login":"maria8899","id":25709048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzA5MDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25709048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899","html_url":"https://github.com/maria8899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maria8899/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
