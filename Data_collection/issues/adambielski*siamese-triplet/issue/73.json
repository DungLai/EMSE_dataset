I see you are using combinations() functions to generate anchor positive pairs. Shouldn't you generate these pairs using permutations()? Example : if I have two labels - label A having embeddings at indices 0, 2 and label B having embeddings at indices 1, 3. \r\n\r\nUsing your code I am getting <anchor, positive, negative> triplets as: <0,2,1>, <0,2,3>, <1,3,0>, <1,3,2>.\r\n\r\nHowever, using this I am not getting triplets <2,0,1>, <2,0,3>...., etc. using combinations() as written in your code. These will be different from <0,2,1> and <0,2,3> right?\r\n\r\nKindly help me out in understanding why you used combinations() function and claiming that you have got all anchor-positive pairs? If you have read about this from a paper, kindly cite it for me. It's quite urgent. Looking forward to your reply.
