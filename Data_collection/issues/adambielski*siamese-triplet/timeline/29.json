You need to change it accordingly.\r\nTo avoid this you could use a network that uses global average pooling after the last spatial output (e.g. after the last convolutional layer), then your input vector has the size of number of channels which doesn't rely on input size. Then you can reshape and apply one last linear layer. You can look at ResNet or Inception networks as an example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/comments/492624489/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2343055354,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM0MzA1NTM1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/events/2343055354","actor":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-15T11:59:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/comments/518869492","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/29#issuecomment-518869492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/29","id":518869492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODg2OTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"BubuNunu","id":28540610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTQwNjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28540610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu","html_url":"https://github.com/BubuNunu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BubuNunu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T22:37:46Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T22:37:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could you give an example for the modification?
