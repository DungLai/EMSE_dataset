for response. I knew Facenet was a famous example. \r\n\r\nI meant, do you have any plan to include such a larger dataset with more classes into this project ? Facenet was trained on too huge dataset, though. \r\nI am looking for some dataset which provides ~10K classes, with ~10 samples per class, that is, about 100K training examples. -- basically something trainable on one GPU.\r\n\r\nAnd I enjoy your Pytorch code, not Google's TF 1.x facenet code :) Besides, Google did not and cannot open source that dataset.
