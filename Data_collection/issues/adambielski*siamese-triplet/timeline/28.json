That's why we also count the non-zero loss triplets as one of the metric. If you take these into consideration when averaging, it may turn out that the loss in fact decreases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/comments/488705917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2314771943,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxNDc3MTk0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/events/2314771943","actor":{"login":"thouis","id":473043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzA0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis","html_url":"https://github.com/thouis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-02T14:55:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2314771944,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTQ3NzE5NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/events/2314771944","actor":{"login":"thouis","id":473043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzA0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis","html_url":"https://github.com/thouis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thouis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-02T14:55:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2316826521,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMxNjgyNjUyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adambielski/siamese-triplet/issues/events/2316826521","actor":{"login":"adambielski","id":14027793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI3Nzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14027793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski","html_url":"https://github.com/adambielski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambielski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T09:13:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
