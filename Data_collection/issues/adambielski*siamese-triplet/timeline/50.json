In my implementation TripletNetwork takes a triplet as an input - an anchor, a positive and a negative and returns a triplet of embeddings in the same order; so we need to sample the triplets before

All that TripletNetwork does is running the EmbeddingNet for anchors, positive and negative inputs.\r\n\r\nIf we want to use OnlineTripletLoss, we do not sample the triplest before feeding them to the network, we simply get the embeddings for a batch of images (that's why we use EmbeddingNet that only takes one input and returns one output) and use their labels (in a triplet selector) to create triplets afterwards and compute the loss on the computed embeddings.
