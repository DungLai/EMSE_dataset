Everything works successfully for several, but for some .pdb files, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`Found atoms with resnames ['GLY'] in the Molecule which can cause issues with the voxelization. Please make sure to only pass protein atoms and metals.`\r\n\r\nI was wondering why GLY within .pdb files does not work for voxelization, given that it's a valid residue. Also, how can I clean or fix a Molecule object that contains GLY, so I can voxelize it? I'm happy to provide more information or code.
