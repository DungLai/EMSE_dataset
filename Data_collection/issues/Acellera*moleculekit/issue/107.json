I was rencetly using MoleculeKit to process some protein PDB files.  For some reason, MoleculeKit thought that some protein atoms were non-protein atoms. The following is the code I ran with the attached PDB file ([test_pdb.txt](https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/files/8579604/test_pdb.txt), renamed to test_pdb.txt because github didn't like a file with pdb suffix).\r\n```python\r\nfrom moleculekit.molecule import Molecule\r\nfrom moleculekit.tools.atomtyper import prepareProteinForAtomtyping\r\nmol = Molecule('test.pdb')\r\natoms = mol.get('name')\r\nprotsel = mol.atomselect('protein')\r\natoms[~protsel]\r\n```\r\nwhich outputs\r\n```python\r\narray(['CE1', 'NE2', 'HE1', 'HE2'], dtype=object)\r\n```\r\nWhich buffled me because these atoms are protein atoms apparently. So, I then went on to run these two lines of code to find out what residue(s) these atoms belong.\r\n```python\r\nresids = mol.get('resid')\r\nresids[~protsel]\r\n```\r\nwhich outputs\r\n```python\r\narray([515, 515, 515, 515])\r\n```\r\nResidue 515 happens to be a HIS.  Can you please help look into what might have caused this? Thanks a lot!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"computbiolgeek","id":14857395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU3Mzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14857395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek","html_url":"https://github.com/computbiolgeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
