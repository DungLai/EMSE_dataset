Like mentioned in Issue #12, sometimes it is not possible to create a SmallMol. I am trying to reproduce the KDeep-paper. You said me already, that during the dev of the paper, the SmallMol-Class does not exist and you use the Molecule-Class.\r\n\r\nWell If I create the Molecule class from a ligand, than I get an Error in getVoxelDescriptor(), that my Mol is not a protein.\r\nIs the only option, the deactivation of the validitychecks?\r\nHow I get a similar result like it was used in the 'old' package. \r\n\r\nIf this is not possible, I think I have to use the old version of the package. But then I need to have my data in the ptbqt-format form AutoDock4. Can you give me a hint, how you have converted the files in the ptbqt-format?
