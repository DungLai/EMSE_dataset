Applying now this function to my test case, the extracted channels were all zeros except from the last, and i found that it is caused by the `mol.atomtype` which is an array of empty values. In the `version=2` branch of `getChannels` there is a specific atom_typing extraction. Maybe it should be added something similar and to the `version=1` branch?","closed_by":{"login":"stemylonas","id":44260477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjYwNDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44260477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas","html_url":"https://github.com/stemylonas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stemylonas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
