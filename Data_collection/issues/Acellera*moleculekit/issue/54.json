In particular, nothing happens after executing the following lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom moleculekit.molecule import Molecule\r\nfrom moleculekit.tools.voxeldescriptors import getVoxelDescriptors, viewVoxelFeatures\r\nfrom moleculekit.tools.atomtyper import prepareProteinForAtomtyping\r\nfrom moleculekit.smallmol.smallmol import SmallMol\r\nfrom moleculekit.home import home\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nslig = SmallMol('benzamidine.mol2')   # I have placed benzamidine.mol2 in the same folder\r\nlig_vox, lig_centers, lig_N = getVoxelDescriptors(slig, voxelsize=0.5, buffer=1)\r\nslig.view(guessBonds=False)\r\nviewVoxelFeatures(lig_vox, lig_centers, lig_N)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried both in jupyter notebook and in iPython. I have installed `moleculekit` through conda (`conda install moleculekit -c acellera`) and the version of VMD installed in my system is `VMD for LINUXAMD64, version 1.9.3 (December 1, 2016)`. VMD is precompiled. My OS is Ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nI have searched the documentation but I haven't found any info on how to make VMD work. Do you think you could give me some guidance?
