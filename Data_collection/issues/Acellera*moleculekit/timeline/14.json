Also the selenium error raises after filtering of protein and preperation function.\r\n\r\nThe filtering of the Chain seems problematic. I would assume, that the ligand is not always in the same chain. So it seems like, I have to filter this for every molecule manually. For around 4k complexes this seems not doable. Did you know a method, how one can do this automatically?\r\nMaybe this could be the last trick.\r\nAlso, does it not change the chemical properties of the molecule, if one is filtering out some sidechains? \r\nI would expect a big influence on the chemical properties, the voxel-features and also on the binding behavior. But I do not know. This is just a rough assumption. What is your opinion to this?\r\n\r\nIs there any case, in which the deactivation of validitychecks is a good idea? \r\n\r\nNevetheless. In some cases the ligand has for example 5 bonds for a carbon. The converting with autodock can fix this, but nobody knows, if the result is the experimental ligand and in the worst but not unprobable case, the fixed ligand is wrong and the binding affinity does not match to the complex anymore. It seems, that this could be a problem and could lead to a bias in a CNN. \r\nBut this is just a really rough assumption and thats why I am sceptical if this is a good idea. \r\nBut this is another Problem, which is not part of this
