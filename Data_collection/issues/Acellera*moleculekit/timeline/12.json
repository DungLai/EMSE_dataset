devs,\r\n\r\nI have a short question to the Topic getVoxelDescriptors. Like mentioned in Issue #12, sometimes it is not possible to create a SmallMol. I am trying to reproduce the KDeep-paper. You said me already, that during the dev of the paper, the SmallMol-Class does not exist and you use the Molecule-Class.\r\n\r\nWell If I create the Molecule class from a ligand, than I get an Error in getVoxelDescriptor(), that my Mol is not a protein.\r\nIs the only option, the deactivation of the validitychecks?\r\nHow I get a similar result like it was used in the 'old' package. \r\n\r\nIf this is not possible, I think I have to use the old version of the package. But then I need to have my data in the ptbqt-format form AutoDock4. Can you give me a hint, how you have converted the files in the ptbqt-format?

This is the dataset, which was used in the KDeep-paper of your group. Because I want to reproduce the results of the paper as baseline for masterthesis, I have to use this data. You can get the data here http://pdbbind.org.cn/. In this case, this are data from the refined set of 2016.\r\n\r\nFrom around 3700 data for the training-set of the NN, 1200 leads to this errors.\r\nOne of the supporter of the HTMD has said, that during the dev of this paper, no SmallMolecule class was avaible and I should use the Molecule-class instead. Like mentioned in issue #13 this seems not as a good idea. So how I can get the voxelized data for the NN with your software?\r\n\r\n`sm = SmallMol('1a1e_ligand.mol2', force_reading=True, removeHs=False, fixHs=False)`\r\n\r\nThis kind of stuff is working for some of the data. The first question I have is maybe a little bit stupid, but there are hydrogen in the files. Does this not mean, that they are allready protonated?\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, there are some files, which I can not read in, also with this trick. For example the complex \"1ols\" failed to read with this.\r\n\r\nSo in general, there must be an option, to get the voxelised data with features for the ligands, to reproduce the results of KDeep. In the paper they mentioned, that HTMD is the software, which can be used to get these. But actually I can not see, how I can do this. Or better how should do this.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have an idea, what is the fastest way to get the voxelised data for the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this comment is an combination from this issue and the closed issue #13.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/498964394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BioFreak95","id":32635839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjM1ODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32635839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95","html_url":"https://github.com/BioFreak95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/498973778","html_url":"https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/12#issuecomment-498973778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/12","id":498973778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODk3Mzc3OA==","user":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T07:39:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T07:39:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm sorry but I cannot help you clean the PDBbind dataset.

The issue with the element names is solved as far as I'm concerned in the last version.\r\n\r\nDon't disable the validity checks. The option is only there for performance reasons if all your data is already perfect and you don't want to waste time doing the checks.\r\n\r\nThe error you get means that there are no bonds in the molecule which is very weird. Do a `%debug` when it throws the error in `ipython` and check what the `mol` object contains and do `mol.view(guessBonds=False)` which will show the structure with the bonds it contains (probably not bonds, just dots in space). Then you can figure out why the bond guessing failed. My guess is that the structure is probably broken or empty.\r\n\r\nAlso as a general suggestion to get better answers online, keep the error reports a bit more concise otherwise it's hard to answer to so many questions over so many posts.
