After executing the script, I realized that VMD wasn't running properly in my laptop because VMD windows didn't show up in general (so the problem wasn't specific to `moleculekit`, but was system-wide). I don't know what the problem was, maybe the `$DISPLAY` variable wasn't being used properly, but I reinstalled VMD and that fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nSince everything is working fine now I'll close the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/686600273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgarort","id":26173140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTczMTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26173140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort","html_url":"https://github.com/mgarort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3725528707,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzcyNTUyODcwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/events/3725528707","actor":{"login":"mgarort","id":26173140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTczMTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26173140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort","html_url":"https://github.com/mgarort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarort/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T16:14:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
