I'm trying to point out that this only happened because of your specific conda setup\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(base) stefan@spectre:~$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\r\n(base) stefan@spectre:~$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\r\n(base) stefan@spectre:~$ ipython\r\nCommand 'ipython' not

can be installed with:\r\nsudo apt install ipython\r\n(base) stefan@spectre:~$ conda install ipython\r\n```\r\n\r\nipython doesn't come installed with Miniconda. \r\nThe issue you had only exists because you *explicitly* installed ipython in your base environment and then created a different environment with moleculekit. \r\nThis would not have happened if a) you installed moleculekit in your base environment b) you hadn't installed ipython in the main environment c) if you were using Jupyter (which many people use). Should we also install jupyter, or Spyder because some people use it?\r\n\r\nExamples which don't put ipython in their deps:\r\n* PyEmma: https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA/blob/devel/setup.py#L291\r\n* MDTraj: https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/blob/master/setup.py#L258\r\n* Biopython:

https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder/blob/master/setup.py#L82\r\n\r\nI'm totally up for writing a user guide or \"Get started\" tutorial which shows how to use moleculekit and suggesting to use ipython or jupyter.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/549557264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/553202294","html_url":"https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/38#issuecomment-553202294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/38","id":553202294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzIwMjI5NA==","user":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T01:58:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T01:58:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated
