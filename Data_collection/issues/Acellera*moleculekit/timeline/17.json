Thanks for picking it up. It's in the assumption that you cannot have less bonds than atoms while of course you can have one less bond than atoms. I will fix the bond check.\r\n\r\nAs for the PDB it's a funny workaround you found. The bond guesser returns undirected bonds (one per pair) but when we write to PDB we write them directed (two per pair, both ways). So then you have double the bonds and it passes the check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/511319263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/511320284","html_url":"https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/17#issuecomment-511320284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/17","id":511320284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTMyMDI4NA==","user":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T08:47:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T08:47:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed here: https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/commit/53681e95e064b55a3c7d20ef9fa96a775a7f1cbe\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the fix either wait for a new release or use directly the moleculekit source code from github.
