It guesses bonds based on atom distances and elements and anything that is not bonded to the protein is regarded as non-protein. In your case there might be some larger-than-normal distance in the atoms of that histidine, or maybe it's lacking backbone N, CA, C atoms (which also makes VMD guess stuff as non-protein).\r\nIf you manage to build it with amber.build you should be able to do correct atom-selections using the prmtop since the bonds will be exact.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/1111816253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/1112812826","html_url":"https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/107#issuecomment-1112812826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/107","id":1112812826,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCp7fnc5CVC0a","user":{"login":"computbiolgeek","id":14857395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU3Mzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14857395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek","html_url":"https://github.com/computbiolgeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computbiolgeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-29T02:02:28Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T02:02:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Stefen, thanks for the quick reply.
