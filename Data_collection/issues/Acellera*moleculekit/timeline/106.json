They moved now to `toml` and `cfg` files instead. The issues is that we determine the package version dynamically in the `setup.py`\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    version = (\r\n        subprocess.check_output([\"git\", \"describe\", \"--abbrev=0\", \"--tags\"])\r\n        .strip()\r\n        .decode(\"utf-8\")\r\n    )\r\nexcept Exception as e:\r\n    print(\"Could not get version tag. Defaulting to version 0\")\r\n    version = \"0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is great for not bothering to update the version at every release but when you install it via pypi it will try to run setup.py, there are no tags defined (since it's not a git repo), default to version=0 and throw the error. \r\nI'll need to eventually take a look at the new setuptools methodology but pip installation of moleculekit is not officially supported anyway so I'm not in a big hurry.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/1147122424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6750755967,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCp7fnc5Il61qzwAAAAGSYFx_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/events/6750755967","actor":{"login":"duerrsimon","id":16979577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTc5NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16979577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon","html_url":"https://github.com/duerrsimon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-06T07:09:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6750755973,"node_id":"SE_lADOCp7fnc5Il61qzwAAAAGSYFyF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/events/6750755973","actor":{"login":"duerrsimon","id":16979577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTc5NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16979577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon","html_url":"https://github.com/duerrsimon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duerrsimon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-06T07:09:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/comments/1147126591","html_url":"https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/106#issuecomment-1147126591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Acellera/moleculekit/issues/106","id":1147126591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCp7fnc5EX8M_","user":{"login":"tonigi","id":2752011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2752011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi","html_url":"https://github.com/tonigi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonigi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-06T07:14:51Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T07:14:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Perhaps
