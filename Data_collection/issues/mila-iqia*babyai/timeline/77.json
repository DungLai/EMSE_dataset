It seems like this mask initialization would have been an issue but the memory initialization (zero at the start of every process) seems to take care of it. Basically the purpose that needed to be served was that the memory should be zero at the start of experience of each process. Since the memory is itself zero initialized, this will be taken care of. \r\n\r\nI am closing this issue :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/comments/507903375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chitwansaharia","id":16670698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjcwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16670698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia","html_url":"https://github.com/chitwansaharia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2456077845,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ1NjA3Nzg0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/events/2456077845","actor":{"login":"chitwansaharia","id":16670698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjcwNjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16670698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia","html_url":"https://github.com/chitwansaharia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitwansaharia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-03T01:33:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
