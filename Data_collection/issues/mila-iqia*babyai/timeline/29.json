By then we really need to generate the demos and make sure that the code to run the experiments is still working correctly. Might be wise to start some test runs without waiting for all the demos to be

When working on a subgoal with `reason=\"Open\"` the agent can interrupt going to the door and go to the respective key instead. The agent commits in such case to go the specific locked door, even if it later finds a suitable open door. Such a commitment is necessary in order to remember to drop the key. \r\n\r\nAfter the above change, an issue arose whereby it was not clear when the agent should drop the key after opening the door and when it shouldn't. I figured that the agent should always drop the key unless it had already had the key when it decided to walk to the door. `reason=\"UnlockAndKeepKey\"` was introduced to handle this case. \r\n\r\nThe bot gained some speed (see below). 1M demo test is yet to be launched.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(babyai) ╭─dzmitry@dzmitry-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-5th ~/Dist/baby-ai-game  ‹dima-faster-unlock*› \r\n╰─$ python3 -m scripts.eval_bot --level GoToImpUnlock --num_runs 200                          \r\n   GoToImpUnlock: 100.0%, r=0.830, s=108.94\r\ntotal time: 41.5s\r\ntotal episode_steps: 21787\r\ntotal bfs: 35436\r\ntotal bfs steps: 3115704\r\n(babyai) ╭─dzmitry@dzmitry-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-5th ~/Dist/baby-ai-game  ‹master› \r\n╰─$ python3 -m scripts.eval_bot --level GoToImpUnlock --num_runs 200\r\n   GoToImpUnlock: 100.0%, r=0.817, s=117.06\r\ntotal time: 37.9s\r\ntotal episode_steps: 23413\r\ntotal bfs: 36966\r\ntotal bfs steps: 3387158\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2106876497,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjEwNjg3NjQ5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/events/2106876497","actor":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-30T15:35:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
