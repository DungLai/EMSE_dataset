I am currently running the task GoToRedBallGrey with the settings bow_endpool_res. \r\nAccording to the babyai paper, the observations should be 7x7x3 showing the pixels in front. \r\n\r\nHowever, here are 3 different episodes that I saved which confused me alot. \r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me where the agent is in the 7x7x3 screen? \r\n\r\nMoreover, in both of these trajectories, **sometimes the field of view moves**, --- and --- **sometimes a pixel in the environment moves**. It is unclear to me how this corresponds to an **agent-centric point of view** in **GoToRedBallGrey** -- hence I want to ask if there is **possibly a bug in the implementation of the GoToRedBallGrey task**\r\n\r\n\r\n![Movie_babya5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56416888/199165794-06ab26ab-a6ce-4b64-9820-d4ec9f1e8e8a.gif)\r\n![Movie_babyai4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56416888/199165797-2d66412d-e64d-4472-811a-55cbd0c47610.gif)\r\n![Movie_babyai3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56416888/199165799-238bbda7-17c9-464a-9948-7424cd0e5eae.gif)\r\nto me). \r\n\r\n(By contrast, when I tried the 56x56x3 screen that you get when you run setting pixels_endpool_res, the agent is very obvious (red triangle) and everything in that setting is clear \r\n\r\nAny insight into this matter would be really really awesome!
