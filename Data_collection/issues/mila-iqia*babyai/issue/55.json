I used the il pretrained model (GoToSeq-1) for the former environment, and the rl pretrained model (PickupLoc-4_best) for the latter. I was expecting to get success rates approximately equal to what has been mentioned in the paper, but I got only 13%, and 65% for the respective cases.\r\nI just ran the evaluate.py script giving in the correct arguments for the mentioned environments and the models. I even ran the enjoy.py script to visualize the performance of these models, but even that did not seem to be too good.\r\nAm I doing something wrong over here, or are these not the best pretrained models?\r\nI have attached the output for the respective evaluation runs for the two cases.\r\n![gotoseq-1_results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13129062/53836107-24989a80-3f5d-11e9-996b-9f6850793ae0.png)\r\n![pickuploc-4_best_results png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13129062/53836108-24989a80-3f5d-11e9-9681-3043f034a3c2.png)\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
