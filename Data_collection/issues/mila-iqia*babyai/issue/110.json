It seems that the gym and gym-minigrid versions are not specified in the repo. I tried gym-minigrid==1.0.2 and gym==0.24.1, and it gives the following error when I run `scripts/train_rl.py --env BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"scripts/train_rl.py\", line 114, in <module>\r\n    reshape_reward)\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/Desktop/babyai/babyai/rl/algos/ppo.py\", line 22, in __init__\r\n    aux_info)\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/Desktop/babyai/babyai/rl/algos/base.py\", line 82, in __init__\r\n    self.obs = self.env.reset()\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/Desktop/babyai/babyai/rl/utils/penv.py\", line 42, in reset\r\n    results = [self.envs[0].reset()] + [local.recv() for local in self.locals]\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/anaconda3/envs/babyai/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/wrappers/order_enforcing.py\", line 42, in reset\r\n    return self.env.reset(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/anaconda3/envs/babyai/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/wrappers/env_checker.py\", line 47, in reset\r\n    return passive_env_reset_check(self.env, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/anaconda3/envs/babyai/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/utils/passive_env_checker.py\", line 247, in passive_env_reset_check\r\n    _check_obs(obs, env.observation_space, \"reset\")\r\n  File \"/home/lthpc/anaconda3/envs/babyai/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/utils/passive_env_checker.py\", line 115, in _check_obs\r\n    ), f\"{pre} is not contained with the observation space ({observation_space})\"\r\nAssertionError: The observation returned by the `reset()` method is not contained with the observation space (Dict(image: Box(0, 255, (7, 7, 3), uint8)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI somehow fixed this by downgrading gym to 0.10.9, but I wonder if the versions of gym and gym-minigrid may affect the environment. Also, the latest version of gym-minigrid no longer supports python 3.6, which was specified in environment.yaml. So can you specify the gym and gym-minigrid versions you used for producing your results?
