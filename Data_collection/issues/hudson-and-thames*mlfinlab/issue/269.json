So I think we should make the threshold argument of the standard bar in the data structure to take in both static (int) and dynamic (pd.Series with datetime_index) threshold. This can let the user sample the volume and dollar_volume bars with a dynamic threshold and adapt to the changes in the market. This was also mentioned in the book Adv. in Financial ML (page-28, 2nd paragraph). He advised not to keep the size of the bar constant over time, instead dynamically adjust it as a function of the free-floating market capitalization of a company (in the case of stocks), or the outstanding amount of issued debt (in the case of fixed-income securities).","closed_by":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/269/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
