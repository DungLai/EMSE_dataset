When I am trying to use get_daily_vol function to get the volatility threshold and type in a value for the lookback period, I discovered from the result that no matter the lookback period equals to 10 / 50 / 100, the daily_vol series always starts on the 63rd dollar bar with a NAN and followed by different numeric values till the end.\r\n\r\nIs there any bug for the function? Because I assume the lookback period should somehow affect the starting point of the daily_vol series. Thank you.
