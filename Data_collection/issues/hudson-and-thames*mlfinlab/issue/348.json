I left the default argument of num_threads=8 as is.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is due to an issue with the multiprocessing library. I have stepped through the function call, and once execution enters the threading.py file (...\\Anaconda\\envs\\env_mlfinlab\\Lib\\threading.py), creation of the Thread class is where execution becomes slow.\r\n\r\nTo check my logic, I then removed mp_pandas_obj() call from the cusum.py file and ran _get_s_n_for_t() directly, execution time was ~90ms. Based on this the issue is in the multiprocessing component.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce -\r\n1. from mlfinlab.structural_breaks.cusum import get_chu_stinchcombe_white_statistics\r\n2. Prepare input data as per the required parameters.\r\n3. get_chu_stinchcombe_white_statistics(series=input_series[\"log_price\"], test_type=\"two_sided\")\r\n\r\nExpected behavior -\r\nI expect the get_chu_stinchcombe_white_statistics() call to run forever with no end.\r\n\r\nDesktop -\r\n\r\nmlfinlab 0.10.0\r\n\r\ncompiler   :  MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)\r\nsystem     : Windows\r\nversion    : 1909 Build 18363.836\r\nmachine    : x64\r\nprocessor  : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz, 3192 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
