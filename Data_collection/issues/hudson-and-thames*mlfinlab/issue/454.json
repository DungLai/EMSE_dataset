Please describe.**\r\nCan I suggest to change the file format requirement for get_dollar_bars() and similar functions to use [parquet](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/python-parquet-update/)  file format instead. Parquet also works with [Dask](https://dask.org) which can speed up the precessing even more.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nread and write files as parquet file format instead of CSV.\r\nIn addition it would be more convenient to pass in the relevant columns separately to remove the necessity to be constrained to 3 columns only in the file. This can be easily done in parquet.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatively HDF5 could be considered too.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe processing can be sped up in any case by using Dask. Works with CSV and parquet.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stnatter","id":28284489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Mjg0NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28284489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter","html_url":"https://github.com/stnatter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnatter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
