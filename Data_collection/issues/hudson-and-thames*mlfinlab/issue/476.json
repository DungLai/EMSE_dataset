Install mlfinlab in Google Colab using: `!pip install mlfinlab`\r\n2. Import any function, e.g: `from mlfinlab.datasets import load_tick_sample`\r\n3. Check the type of the returned object: `type( load_tick_sample() )`\r\n4. This returns NoneType\r\n\r\n**System**\r\nOnly tested in Google Colab.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n- Inspecting the source code shows that the functions now just pass instead of doing any logic.\r\n- Installing a previous version using `!pip install 'mlfinlab<0.15.1` is a temporary work around.","closed_by":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
