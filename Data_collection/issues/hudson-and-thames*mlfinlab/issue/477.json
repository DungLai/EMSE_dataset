Please describe.**\r\nHi, recently I consider becoming one of the sponsor and using your library in my trading bot, so I first tested the compatibility on docker with python 3.7.9 installed.\r\nAfter I installed the vectorbt, which is a backtesting framework for my bot, I realized that vectorbt depend on an library called numba with the version >= 0.50.1. But mlfinlab needs the version exactly equal to 0.49.1. I didn't find a good solution to resolve this. So I wonder if it's possible for you to loose the dependency of numba to make the installation smoother. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently I'm using miniconda to manage these dependencies but it also gave the warning of this issue I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBest regards, KT\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
