Please describe.**\r\nI was reading today chapter 5 in the book. A have also checked your frac_diff_ffd  function to implement fractional differentiation. Is it possible to find the \"optimal\" value of diff_amt, where optimal means as low as a possible value of diff_amt that makes times series stationary? I know I can do it on my own by using some kind of optimization method, but maybe you have already implemented this procedure?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to write a function that automatically finds the lowest value of frac_diff that makes series stationary.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI checked notebooks, but they don't try to find optimal value.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNo additional context.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MislavSag","id":33196375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTk2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33196375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag","html_url":"https://github.com/MislavSag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MislavSag/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
