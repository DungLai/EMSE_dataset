generate index for indicator matrix from t1 and index\r\n    bar_index.extend(triple_barrier_events.t1)\r\n    bar_index = sorted(list(set(bar_index)))  # drop duplicates and sort\r\n```\r\nSo the information about the time span length is gone, and the lengths of all label spans are always 2.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```Python\r\n>>> from mlfinlab.sampling.bootstrapping import get_ind_matrix\r\n>>> ind_mat = get_ind_matrix(triple_barrier_events)\r\n>>> np.all(ind_mat.sum(axis=0) == 2)\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nReturn `False`.\r\nLike bottom of afml page 65, some columns may have more than two 1s.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
