Just wanted to notify you of a couple of free sources that I managed to find back when I was playing around with Advances in Financial Machine Learning. \r\n\r\n1. [Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/). Offers free historical tick data for some futures, though you do have to register.\r\n2. Most crypto exchanges offer tick data but not historical (see [Binance API](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md)). So you'd have to run a script for a few days.\r\n\r\nThought that these might be worth mentioning in the docs. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert","closed_by":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
