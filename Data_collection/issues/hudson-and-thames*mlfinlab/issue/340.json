The index contains second to second granularity.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the `get_daily_vol` function, I get the error\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlfinlab.util.get_daily_vol(df[\"close\"], 50)\r\n>>> ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (40387,) (40351,) \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that when reindexing to daily close, some of the values get dropped [here](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/blob/master/mlfinlab/util/volatility.py#L34), so then the error occurs [here](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/blob/master/mlfinlab/util/volatility.py#L36).\r\n\r\nI even tried coding the function myself from scratch from the book since its so short, and I get the same error.\r\n\r\nProbably this is not a bug in the code, but more likely an issue with the data I am feeding in? Although the documentation does say that `close` is a `pd.Series` and `lookback` is an `int`, so I cannot see the issue. Here is a sample of the data, \r\n\r\n```\r\ndf\r\n>>>\r\nTimeStamp                   close\r\n2018-02-10 00:10:18         8700.00\r\n2018-02-10 00:20:27         8791.01\r\n2018-02-10 00:21:13         8800.00\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nis there something wrong with this data? What datatype(s) would you suggest inputting into `get_daily_vol`?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
