This flexibility is really great, but I fear some users might not realise it. The \"labels\" part of the name is actually a placeholder for both \"events\" and \"bins\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to best tackle this, but I would suggest first changing the name to a ```get_trend_scanning_labels()``` format to be in line with the ```get_events()``` and ```get_bins()``` naming convention.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the name, ```get_trend_scanning_events_and_bins()``` would be more precise but too lengthy. So I would suggest:\r\n\r\n- either splitting the function in two like for triple barrier events:\r\n```\r\nget_trend_scanning_events()\r\nget_trend_scanning_bins()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- or fuse the two triple barrier functions in one using the \"labels\" convention:\r\n```\r\nget_triple_barrier_labels()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis second option could additionally open the road to getting a single ```get_bins()``` function that could accept labels from both approaches for meta-labelling.\r\n\r\nI hope my suggestion is not too confusing, I can try to clarify if needed.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
