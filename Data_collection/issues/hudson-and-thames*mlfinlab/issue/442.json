It wont even have the same weights, this is very concerning as 1 new data entry shouldn't be able to affect the previous days weights or returns, instead the OLPS algo should just trade accordingly\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Download dataset and remove the latest date entry\r\n2. Train any kind of OLPS model on this dataset\r\n3. Go back into your dataset and add the latest date entry to it again\r\n4. Run the OLPS model with the given hyperparameters and see it crush itself on the new data.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAdding a new date entry shouldn't affect previous days weights or returns.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
