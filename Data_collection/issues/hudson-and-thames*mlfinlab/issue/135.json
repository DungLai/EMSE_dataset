Go to `research/Chapter10/Chapter10/Chapter10_Exercises.ipynb`\r\n2. At the end of exercise 10.3 add the following code and run the cell:\r\n    `from mlfinlab.bet_sizing import bet_size_budget`\r\n    `df_events2['side'] = 1`\r\n    `bet_size_budget = bet_size_budget(df_events2['t1'], df_events2['side'])`\r\n    `display(df_events2.head(10))`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDataFrame will be displayed with the `bet_size` column full of `NaN` values.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n - mlfinlab==0.4.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingfischer16","id":17887920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODg3OTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17887920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16","html_url":"https://github.com/kingfischer16","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingfischer16/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
