Those are not found in the original papers either, where the authors do provide a sound derivation, most probably neglecting pathological (yet not extreme) cases in the final result.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the function may return, `inf`, `nan` or a complex number, which of course do not make sense for the SR even if a CDF could formally be extended to the complex domain too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a known design choice, but users may like a diagnostic warning or even an error should any formula be undefined for a given input. This could be the case by other functions implemented in the library.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n`probabilistic_sharpe_ratio(1.2, 1.0, 2, 2, 3)`\r\n\r\nThank you,","closed_by":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
