@peoples-hedge-fund,\r\n\r\nWe've recently released MlFinLab 1.3.0, which supports Python 3.8, 3.7, and 3.6. Now it can be used on Google Colab 🙌 \r\n\r\nWe've also relaxed the hard dependencies, which means integration in existing environments will be much easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/878161542/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5006626736,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTAwNjYyNjczNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/5006626736","actor":{"login":"peoples-hedge-fund","id":79300385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzAwMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79300385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund","html_url":"https://github.com/peoples-hedge-fund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-12T10:25:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5006626745,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUwMDY2MjY3NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/5006626745","actor":{"login":"peoples-hedge-fund","id":79300385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzAwMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79300385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund","html_url":"https://github.com/peoples-hedge-fund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peoples-hedge-fund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-12T10:25:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5043247118,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA0MzI0NzExOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/5043247118","actor":{"login":"PanPip","id":16906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA2OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip","html_url":"https://github.com/PanPip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PanPip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-20T09:39:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"
