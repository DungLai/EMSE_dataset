@proskurin \r\n\r\nSorry, I have been vague in my fix suggestion.\r\nBy reverse order, I don't mean building one bar using ticks in reverse order per se, but build the last bar (let's call it _**b**_) using the last 1000 ticks (in time order), then proceed with the _**b-1**_, and so on. So no lookahead bias.\r\n\r\nBut a more simpler way would just be to keep it like it is now, but starting with a multiple of the thresholds. That way, the last bar would be complete in the sense that I expressed.\r\n\r\n> There is nothing bad that some trades are not used in the latest bar. \r\n\r\nWith the current algorithm, if the last bar by any chance is built using only 10 ticks whereas we ask for a threshold of 1000, I do think it's a problem. I don't see how a ML algorithm could not be misled from a `volume` and `cum_buy_volume` perspective, for instance.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/568727636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flamby","id":1496003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTYwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1496003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby","html_url":"https://github.com/flamby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2906726208,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkwNjcyNjIwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2906726208","actor":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-24T11:17:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2906726210,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MDY3MjYyMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2906726210","actor":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-24T11:17:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/568728241","html_url":"https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/166#issuecomment-568728241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/166","id":568728241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODcyODI0MQ==","user":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-24T11:20:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T11:20:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The

Sorry for that.\r\n> \r\n> Regarding the fact that the algorithm simply drops the last ticks, from a trading perspective, that could be problematic if latest ticks prices drift significantly, would you consider my suggestion of starting the bars creation with a multiple of the threshold then?\r\n\r\nThe implementation is built for a research environment and not for a live data feed. It is under those conditions which I believe the implementation will provide the correct sampling.\r\n\r\nIf you are using this on live data then the ticks being dropped will be a problem but the expectation is that user will need to build a new implementation for a live data feed.
