 These OLPS methods can be used to higher frequency when I use the datetime format correctly.  So this issue is closed. \r\n2.  As authors have mentioned in essays,  these OLPS can be used in high frequency trading. The math they use does not restrict on this. \r\n3.  I tested more products besides ETFs and benchmarks. To share some results,  1)  these OLPS methods may describe the price movement in certain time period of each product, but cannot fits for all time.  2) I would say one method may fit the price movement best for a time rather than which method is the best all the time.
