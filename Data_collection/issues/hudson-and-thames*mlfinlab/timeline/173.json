Thank you for using mlfinlab in such a detailed manner and for reaching out!\r\nI am the original author of the idea implemented here, so I can fully share intuition behind mentioned code.\r\n\r\n> At the moment that the Bar Generation criteria is reached it is expected that the current row would contain information from last line of current date \r\n\r\nThat is not the case here as it is impossible to decide on the current tick whether it is the end of the bar or not. So, here we use the next tick to decide whether its bar label equals current bar label. It means that daily timestamp label e.g. 01.05 00:00:00 (mm.dd HH:MM:SS) contains information from 01.04 00:00:00 inclusively and 01.05 00:00:00 exclusively to entirely avoid look-ahead bias. We were discussing the possiblity of implementing label side parameter (right as it is here, or left i.e. 01.04 00:00:00 as in your OHLC sources) and also inclusion/exclusion of right/left bounds, so I would be excited if you could share your thoughts on the relevance of this change.\r\n\r\n> (since close_price = price and date_time = self.timestamp).\r\n\r\ndate_time is a current tick timestamp, while self.timestamp is a bar label, so their equality sign here is not entirely correct.\r\nIn case with close_price you are absolutely correct, information of a new bars tick is used by previous bar, it is a bug, thank you for pointing that out, we will correct it ASAP.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nArtem","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/578400793/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"artem-matiash","id":29844433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODQ0NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29844433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-matiash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-matiash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2979275658,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk3OTI3NTY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2979275658","actor":{"login":"ro99","id":2497240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99","html_url":"https://github.com/ro99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-25T12:03:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2979275661,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NzkyNzU2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2979275661","actor":{"login":"ro99","id":2497240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99","html_url":"https://github.com/ro99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ro99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-25T12:03:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2979286304,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyOTc5Mjg2MzA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2979286304","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-25T12:30:37Z","assignee":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.gith
