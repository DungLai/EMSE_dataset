 thank you very much for your suggestion. We've made an extensive research regarding Kalman filter tuning and found out that tuning Kalman filter is more of an art rather than science. There are so many ways to do that starting from ALS to cross-validation. That is why we decided not to implement auto-Kalmantuning, because:\r\n1) PyKalman already has EM-algorithm to tune Kalman filter params\r\n2) At the end, a researcher will choose domain-specific method to tune the
