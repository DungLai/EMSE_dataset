We've got a massive performance increase comparing to the book implementation, but it is still slow on very big data sets. You can try optimize algorithm complexity, or try to Cythonise that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/561562729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2853323954,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg1MzMyMzk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2853323954","actor":{"login":"motomoto1225","id":57005105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDA1MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57005105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225","html_url":"https://github.com/motomoto1225","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-04T09:52:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2853323956,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NTMzMjM5NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2853323956","actor":{"login":"motomoto1225","id":57005105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDA1MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57005105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225","html_url":"https://github.com/motomoto1225","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motomoto1225/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-04T09:52:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2913860112,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkxMzg2MDExMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2913860112","actor":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-30T12:47:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
