Description\r\n\r\nIn this PR the following issues are fixed:\r\n \r\nFixes #97 \r\n- Added function plot_min_ffd from **Advances in Financial Machine Learning, page 85** to `fracdiff.py`\r\n- Created a unit test for this function in `test_fracdiff.py`\r\n- Added section **Stationarity With Maximum Memory Representation** to documentation\r\n\r\nFixes #227 \r\n- Fixed a typo in the **Sequentially Bootstrapped Bagging Classifier/Regressor** example in the documentation\r\n\r\nFixes #248 \r\n- Added an option of setting the desired number of PCA features to the `get_orthogonal_features` function from module **Feature Importance**\r\n\r\nFixes #269 \r\n- Added an option of setting a dynamic threshold to functions from module **Data Structures/Standard Bar**: `get_dollar_bars,` `get_volume_bars`, `get_tick_bars`.\r\n- Example of how it works added as a tip to **Data Structures/Standard Bar** documentation.\r\n\r\nFixes #285 \r\n- Fixed a typo in the **Tail Sets** example in documentation\r\n\r\nFixes #289 \r\n- Fixed duplication of sorting in `sampling/bootstrapping.py`.\r\n\r\nFixes #324 \r\n- Added user warnings when probabilistic_sharpe_ratio function output is inappropriate (`nan/inf/complex`) \r\n\r\n**Also:**\r\n- Pylint version updated from `2.4.3` to `2.5.3` as it fixes some previously encountered bugs (such as E1136: Value '...' is unsubscriptable for the shape of np.array)\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking

\r\n\r\n- [x] test_fracdiff.py\r\n- [x] test_backtest_statistics.py\r\n- [x] test_feature_importance.py\r\n- [X] test_standard_data_structures.py\r\n\r\n**Test Configuration**:\r\n* Windows 10\r\n* PyCharm\r\n\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly
