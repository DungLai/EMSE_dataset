pandas: 0.25.3 -> 1.0.4\r\n  - numpy: 1.17.3 -> 1.18.5\r\n  - scikit-learn: 0.21.3 -> 0.23.1\r\n  - scipy: 1.3.1 -> 1.4.1\r\n  - matplotlib: 3.1.1 -> 3.2.1\r\n  - cvxpy: 1.0.25 -> 1.1.1\r\n- Travis CI build process is updated:\r\n  - Now pylint shows only important results output and raw metrics tables (no dependency tree and unneeded tables)\r\n  - All Warnings and leaked Errors during unit tests were fixed\r\n  - During the build, only the errors in tests are displayed without unnecessary prints from test functions\r\n  - Previous unit tests + coverage procedure was replaced by only coverage since errors in unit tests will anyways show during coverage test\r\n  - Build time decreased from 40 minutes to 24 minutes\r\n- Some unit tests were adjusted to decrease testing time and adjust to new versions of packages\r\n- Functions that use multiprocessing (labeling, sample weights, sb_bagging, structural breaks) now have an option to silence the report of progress on asynch jobs\r\n- Documentation issues were fixed\r\n- All sphinx warnings were fixed\r\n- Small imbalance sample dataset added\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #190, #197, #228, #249, #313, #335, #356, #358, \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThe following changes were tested on all previous MlFinLab unit tests.\r\n\r\nUnit test values were changed only if the method algorithms was changed in the used package (mostly scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier and BaggingClassifier functions). Or if the test dataset was decreased to improve testing time.\r\n\r\n**Test Configuration**:\r\n* Windows 10\r\n* PyCharm\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this
