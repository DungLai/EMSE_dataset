It also means you have to use Python 3.8 and  pip==20.1.1.\r\n\r\nIt is very very important that you use the versions we specify. By using other versions we can't guarantee that the code will work as expected. In fact, we know that it won't.\r\n\r\nWe are going to drop the TF dependency which will make the library much lighter but you will need to install it if you want to use synthetic data generation.\r\n\r\nWe will release 1.0.1 today. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nJacques
