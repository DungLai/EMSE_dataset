should add that when a very large trade comes in, say 2 times bigger than the threshold, we only sample once and discard the remainder volume, then count from the next trade.\r\n\r\nThis was deliberate as the threshold is used to signal when to sample as a proxy for information. Thus sampling multiple times per trade doesnt make sense.\r\n\r\nThe cum volume, price, and ticks in the output dataframe is to be used for sanity checks.
