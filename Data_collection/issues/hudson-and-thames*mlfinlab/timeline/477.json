@gary9716, \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't change the version numbers, if we do, something will break. \r\n\r\nWe noticed that many users expect to have relaxed versioning but everytime we change the versions, our unit tests pick up breaking changes. Thank God for 100% coverage. \r\n\r\nWe do update our libraries once a year, the next one is scheduled around April 2021. \r\n\r\nYou can also add a flag to your pip install to not install the dependencies. This would work but it's risky since I am quite confident something will break and you won't be able to tell which parts.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/748636904/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4133512586,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEzMzUxMjU4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/4133512586","actor":{"login":"gary9716","id":4500186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDAxODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4500186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716","html_url":"https://github.com/gary9716","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-20T17:34:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4133512588,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMzM1MTI1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/4133512588","actor":{"login":"gary9716","id":4500186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDAxODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4500186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716","html_url":"https://github.com/gary9716","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gary9716/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-20T17:34:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4133551597,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEzMzU1MTU5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/4133551597","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-20T18:23:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
