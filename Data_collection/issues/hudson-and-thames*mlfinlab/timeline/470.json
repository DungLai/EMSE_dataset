again! \r\nThank you for providing the data! I managed to reproduce your results. \r\n\r\nThere are a few things that can be done to improve your results: \r\n \r\n\r\n- Using daily data. \r\n\r\nThis approach is more tailored for the strategies with a longer holding period - daily data works best.\r\n\r\n- Using smaller training samples.\r\n\r\nSamples that are too large cause the integrals necessary for the root-finding to diverge, since the number of observations is included in its' calculation.\r\n\r\nHope it helps to achieve better results!
