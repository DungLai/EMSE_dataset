input/output formats are desireable, particularly to support the following use cases:\r\n\r\na) Processing a directory of csv files, for example daily tick data, 2019-10-25.csv, 2019-10-26.csv, etc.\r\nb) Streaming input in a server process.\r\n\r\nEssentially:\r\n    \r\n1) Param file_path_or_df is moved from constructor to batch_run method, as data is not yet available if streaming.\r\n2) New method _batch_iterator yields batches to within batch_run method.\r\n3) New method run calls self._extract bars method.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nBy supporting additional input/output formats, and streaming inputs, mlfinlab can be used to extract bars with tick data from websocket connections, etc.   \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x]
