In fact, I was on these yesterday. Dr Lopez de Prado has mentioned how to obtain the minimum value of diff_amt in the book. You can also see the implementation in the research [notebook,](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/blob/master/Chapter5/Chapter5_Exercises.ipynb) where the plot_min_ffd has been used. \r\nWhat I have done is just modified the plot_min_ffd function and to return the diff_amt value as soon as the p_value drops below 0.05.
