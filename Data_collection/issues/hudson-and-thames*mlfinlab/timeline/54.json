the bug**\r\nI'm not sure if issue #54 is for this.\r\n`add_vertical_barrier` does not handle business day.\r\nIf time delta is `num_days=1`, then `get_events` tends to label events on Fridays as 0,\r\nbecause `searchsorted` will return the index of the first bar next Monday.\r\n\r\nI think using `pd.tseries.offsets.BusinessDay` can solve this according to [Python | Pandas tseries.offsets.BusinessDay](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-tseries-offsets-businessday/)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```Shell\r\n>>> t_events\r\nDatetimeIndex(['2015-01-30 20:43:58.140000'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n>>> add_vertical_barrier(t_events, close, num_days=1)\r\n2015-01-30 20:43:58.140   2015-02-01 23:26:29.558\r\nName: date_time, dtype: datetime64[ns]\r\n>>> close.index[1102]\r\nTimestamp('2015-02-01 23:26:29.558000')\r\n>>> close.index[1153]\r\nTimestamp('2015-02-02 20:44:59.143000')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`add_vertical_barrier` should return (approximate)\r\n```\r\n2015-01-30 20:43:58.140   2015-02-02 20:44:59.143\r\nName: date_time, dtype: datetime64[ns]\r\n```\r\nrather than\r\n```\r\n2015-01-30 20:43:58.140   2015-02-01 23:26:29.558\r\nName: date_time, dtype: datetime64[ns]\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, there would be lots of unexpected 0 labels, and a algorithm would not trade on Fridays.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2531506812,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUzMTUwNjgxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2531506812","actor":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-03T22:25:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
