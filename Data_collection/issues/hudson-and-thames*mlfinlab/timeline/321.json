So I figured out why you are getting the error. Sharpe ratio calculation requires expected_asset_returns and not asset_returns. There is a little difference between the two\r\n\r\nasset_returns: This parameter refers to the returns dataframe/matrix for each asset indexed by date. This parameter is required for calculating the optimal number of clusters in the hierarchical clustering tree. Or, you can just specify the number of clusters if you do not want the algo to run the optimal clustering algo.\r\n\r\nexpected_asset_returns: This parameter refers to the expected asset return values (parameter mu used in portfolio optimisation lingo). Thus, for 10 assets in your portfolio, you will have one value per asset for the expected returns. This is why it is throwing an error. Note that this parameter is only required if you are using the sharpe_ratio as your allocation_metric.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense. I understand this needs to be specified in the documentation. I will update it properly soon. Stay tuned for the updates.

However, the calculation of the optimal number of clusters is part of the steps of the HCAA algorithm and since it can change with data, I do not run it beforehand (when the class object gets defined). All inputs to the algo are through the allocate() method, so it always runs when allocate() is called. This is also why I provided the option to specify the value as a parameter, if you know that for your data, the number of clusters will be in a certain range then you just specify it as a parameter.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the optimal number of clusters is calculated using Gap index which is a slow algorithm and that is why it takes time. I will be adding an option to use other methods to arrive at the number of clusters which are faster than the Gap method (Silhouette Index).\r\n\r\nThe asset returns dataframe is only required for \"expected_shortfall\" and \"conditional_drawdown_risk\". However, there was a bug in the code due to which it was always required. I have already fixed this in my PR which will be merged soon! After it gets merged, you will be able to just use your expected_asset_returns list and covariance matrix and you should be fine to

After it gets merged, you will be able to just use your expected_asset_returns list and covariance matrix and you should be fine to go!\r\n\r\nAnd that you would also be adding the silhouette index, which is faster than the Gap index.\r\n\r\nHave these been implemented / merged in yet? I had some thoughts and was planning on revisiting HRP / HCAA soon!\r\n\r\nThanks very much :)\r\n-Keith\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/636370013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchima","id":1223934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima","html_url":"https://github.com/kchima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/638474302","html_url":"https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/321#issuecomment-638474302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/321","id":638474302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODQ3NDMwMg==","user":{"login":"aditya1702","id":15054664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU0NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15054664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya1702","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1702/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T21:34:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T21:34:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kchima Currently, we are focussing on improving the documentation for portfolio optimisation.
