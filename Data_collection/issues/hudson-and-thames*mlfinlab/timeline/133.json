Sorry, it is our fault, docs should be:\r\n`price_bars = pd.read_csv('PRICE_BARS_FILE_PATH', index_col=0, parse_dates = [0])`, you pass price_bars.close as algorithm param in SequentiallyBootstrappedBaggingClassifier. However, the algorithm only needs date_time index of price bars so it actually doesn't matter if you path price_bars.close or price_bars.high because price info is not used in indicator matrix generation, only datetime index.
