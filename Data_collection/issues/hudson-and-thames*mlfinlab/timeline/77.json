Unit tests have been built to test `ch10_snippets.py` (the units that make up the user-level functions). The file `bet_sizing.py` also has the skeletons of the 2 other functions that must be added. A notebook for testing the `bet_size_probability()` function is included, but is not of tutorial quality. This will have to be polished in a future update with the other 2 functions.\r\n\r\nContributes to fixing issues #76 and #77\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThe unit test is included in the `bet_sizing` folder, but must be moved to the `test` folder when finished. The unit test file `test_ch10_snippets.py` contains all relevant test cases.\r\n\r\n- [x] test_get_signal\r\n- [x] test_avg_active_signals\r\n- [x] test_discrete_signal\r\n\r\n**Test
