@Eriz11 \r\n\r\nThe weights displayed for ``2019-05-26`` in the final ``all_weights`` is actually the weights predicted from data until ``2019-05-25``. Therefore, if we had ``{A:0.25, B:0.25, C:0.5}`` for ``2019-05-26``, it actually means based on the data until ``2019-05-25`` we decided to choose those weights for the day's start. The final returns are calculated from the change in daily returns for each portfolio. Also calling ``.weights`` gives you the most recent prediction based on the entire data.\r\n\r\nTo your first observation of calling ``.allocate()`` on the whole dataset for the last price, it is necessary to do that if the particular algorithm looks back for the whole duration (i.e. CORN, OLMAR-2, etc).\r\n\r\nTo your second observation, that should be a lot faster, but it does depend on which one you are choosing. ``RMR`` in particular does have its specific window frame, so as long as you input the correct number of data points and initial weight, it should be fine. However, for the CORN strategies, it is based on the entire historical window, so that might not be the best choice.\r\n\r\nFor *PD*, I think what you've done in *1* and *2* are perfectly valid to recalculate and append the results, but for *PD2*, I'm slightly reluctant to do so as simulating can be in different forms especially with different transaction costs considerations (something that I have not incorporated).\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out these things, I should clarify these issues in the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/650269172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3487277819,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ4NzI3NzgxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3487277819","actor":{"login":"Eriz11","id":33129094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI5MDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33129094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11","html_url":"https://github.com/Eriz11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:23:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3487277821,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0ODcyNzc4MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3487277821","actor":{"login":"Eriz11","id":33129094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI5MDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33129094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11","html_url":"https://github.com/Eriz11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eriz11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:23:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3487336965,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNDg3MzM2OTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3487336965","actor":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:40:30Z","assignee":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":

Therefore, if we had {A:0.25, B:0.25, C:0.5} for 2019-05-26, it actually means based on the data until 2019-05-25 we decided to choose those weights for the day's start. The final returns are calculated from the change in daily returns for each portfolio. Also calling .weights gives you the most recent prediction based on the entire data.\r\n\r\nSo, let's say that today `2020-06-26` after the close of X market I get all the `close` data up to and including today, input that into the `.allocate()` method (_without taking into account here that I could optimize the algorithm by just passing the `window` data for some implementations_) and the `.weights` attribute would be the weights that are chosen for `Monday start` in this case (i.e. `2020-06-29`).\r\n\r\nIf my assumption and understanding is correct (**correct me again if I'm wrong**), the implementation is even more brilliant and straightforward!\r\n\r\n> For PD, I think what you've done in 1 and 2 are perfectly valid to recalculate and append the results, but for PD2, I'm slightly reluctant to do so as simulating can be in different forms especially with different transaction costs considerations (something that I have not incorporated).\r\n\r\nUnderstood. I meant not as a \"must\" but more like an accesory implementation, but I'm sure that you will have better and more complete ideas for it!\r\n\r\nMany thanks
