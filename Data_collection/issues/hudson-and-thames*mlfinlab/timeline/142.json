If you start your research with questionable data then it compromises the quality of your research. \r\n\r\nMany people focus too heavily on these data structures. I think they are great and the imbalance bars have many interesting properties but most of the other techniques still work without applying a volume clock. \r\n\r\nYou may find that your statistical properties are still boosted by using dollar bars via minute by minute data.

@Jackal08 \r\n\r\nThank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nThe reason I want to use volume clock is that I am trading forex via MT4/MT5 platform. It is difficult to get forex tick data. Even for the 1min data, there is no \"dollar\" and no real \"volume\", because the \"volume\" is quotation changes in one minute. I want to make use of the fake \"volume\" to generate \"volume\" bar, then I can do further test.\r\n\r\nI hope the package could provide us a new method to generate \"dollar\" bar or \"volume\" bar from 1min data instead of tick data.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/546587835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"coolsnake","id":1031968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzE5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1031968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake","html_url":"https://github.com/coolsnake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coolsnake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2745983108,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc0NTk4MzEwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2745983108","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-26T09:45:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2745983110,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NDU5ODMxMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/2745983110","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-26T09:45:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/546589582","html_url":"https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/142#issuecomment-546589582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/142","id":546589582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjU4OTU4Mg==","user":{"login":"proskurin","id":14288229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14288229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin","html_url":"https://github.com/proskurin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/proskurin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-26T10:12:41Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T10:12:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@coolsnake
