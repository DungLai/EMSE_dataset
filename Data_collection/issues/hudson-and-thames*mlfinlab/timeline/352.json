@akwon31 \r\n\r\nOn Estimating Transaction Costs for Online Strategies\r\n\r\nI came up with a simple and crude Pandas-based methodology for computing online strategy transaction costs.\r\n\r\nIt uses three inputs:\r\n1) Transaction Costs.\r\n2) Weights of Portfolio Elements.\r\n3) Cumulative Returns of the Portfolio.\r\n\r\nSee below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Get Weights and Returns from All Tickers\r\n\r\nweights = strategy.all_weights\r\nreturns = strategy.portfolio_return\r\nreturns.columns = [\"cummulative_strategy_returns\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n# Helper Function for Estimating Transaction Costs from Rebalancing Portfolio\r\n\r\ndef compute_net_cummulative_returns(returns, weights, transaction_costs=0.005):\r\n    \r\n    print(\"Total Weighting Changes Per Ticker:\")\r\n    print(\"\")\r\n    print((weights != weights.shift(axis=0)).sum(axis=0))\r\n    daily_transaction_frame = ((weights != weights.shift(axis=0)).cumsum(axis=0)).diff()\r\n    daily_transaction_frame = daily_transaction_frame.fillna(value=1)\r\n    \r\n    gross_allocation = weights.mul(returns['cummulative_strategy_returns'], axis=0)\r\n    net_allocation_absolute = np.abs(gross_allocation.diff())\r\n    transaction_costs_per_ticker = net_allocation_absolute.mul(transaction_costs)\r\n    transactions_costs_aggregate = pd.DataFrame(transaction_costs_per_ticker.sum(axis=1), columns=[\"aggregrate_costs\"])\r\n    transactions_costs_aggregate = transactions_costs_aggregate.fillna(value=0)\r\n    transactions_costs_aggregate.iloc[0, transactions_costs_aggregate.columns.get_loc('aggregrate_costs')] = transaction_costs\r\n    profitability_elements = pd.concat([returns, transactions_costs_aggregate], axis=1)\r\n    net_cummulative_returns = pd.DataFrame((profitability_elements[\"cummulative_strategy_returns\"] - \\\r\n                                            profitability_elements[\"aggregrate_costs\"]), \r\n                                            columns=[\"net_cummulative_returns\"])\r\n\r\n    return daily_transaction_frame, net_cummulative_returns\r\n\r\ndaily_transaction_frame, net_cummulative_returns = compute_net_cummulative_returns(returns, weights, transaction_costs=0.005)\r\nnet_cummulative_returns\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the method in harmony with the other computations that are made by the sub-module? I just want to be sure that it is a\r\nlogically and mathematically sound approach.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n-C.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/650332017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cschiri","id":31516469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTE2NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31516469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri","html_url":"https://github.com/cschiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschiri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3487698140,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ4NzY5ODE0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3487698140","actor":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T18:33:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3487698144,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0ODc2OTgxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3487698144","actor":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T18:33:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/650382622","html_url":"https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/352#issuecomment-650382622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/352","id":650382622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDM4MjYyMg==","user":{"login":"akwon31","id":29555998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU1OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29555998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31","html_url":"https://github.com/akwon31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akwon31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-26T20:22:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T20:22:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cschiri
