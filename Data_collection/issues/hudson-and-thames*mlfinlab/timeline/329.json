Then C will guarantee to overlap, since A already occupied all the possible t0 to t1.\r\n\r\nConcurrency concept itself has nothing to do with returns, but rather uniqueness of each events i.e. A, B or C. (r_8? I'm assuming \"r\" stands for return)\r\n\r\nHowever, if all possible start time (t0) to end time (t1) was [t_1, t_11] instead. The only way for C to be highly unique would be [t_9, t_11]. In that case, if A, B was chosen C will be reflected with a very high probability to be next pick.\r\n\r\nHowever, do take note as np.random.choice may not choose samples that were assigned higher probabilities, based on my experience (Not sure why, probably because its \"random?\").\r\n\r\nDid I answer your question?
