Improves the processing speed of Entropy Features from issue #198 by making the function _match_length() compatible with Numba.\r\n\r\nFixes Issues #341 and #405 \r\n- Fixes Error in ONC caused by precision errors (the main diagonal of the correlation matrix was slightly higher than 1, so the distance matrix couldn't be calculated).\r\n\r\nFixes issue #403 \r\n- Moves all labeling techniques in docs to the separate folder.\r\n\r\nFixes PR #418  (build wasn't passing)\r\n- ONC code example is now simpler.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n-
