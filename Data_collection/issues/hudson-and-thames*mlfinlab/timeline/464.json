The reason we peg to specific versions is to ensure that all the code is stable and tested on those versions. \r\n\r\nOften when a package like pandas updates, it has breaking changes and that causes a lot of problems for us. For this reason, we can't use your suggested `>=` solution.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we update all the dependencies once a year to the latest versions and then keep them constant. \r\n\r\nIf you have a good way to manage package dependencies without requiring a lot of overhead for the development team. We are all ears. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nJacques","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/comments/713185417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3901122866,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkwMTEyMjg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3901122866","actor":{"login":"timolson","id":1697115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTcxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1697115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson","html_url":"https://github.com/timolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-20T22:54:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3901122869,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MDExMjI4Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3901122869","actor":{"login":"timolson","id":1697115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTcxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1697115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson","html_url":"https://github.com/timolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-20T22:54:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3918024125,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkxODAyNDEyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/events/3918024125","actor":{"login":"Jackal08","id":6911714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackal08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackal08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-25T17:12:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
