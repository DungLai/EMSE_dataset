Thanks for sharing the code.\r\nI would like to know how you convert the AFM reuslts (other methods as well)  into the npz format which is used in the mAPJ/SAP evaluation? Can you share this part? Currently I have trouble reproducing the reported results of AFM in your paper. The numbes I got are 4.7 6.5 7.6 (sAP on ShanghaiTech), which are ~20 (sAP10) lower than the ones in the paper (Table 2). I have checked that the afm lines and gt lines before the 'lcnn.metric.msTPFP' function are matched by visualization (check the figure below), so I was wondering why the afm result I got is so bad compare with the one in paper?  Looking forward to your help!\r\n![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26435516/75100307-350daf00-55cc-11ea-8a65-3e78ec17ff77.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"zhou13","id":576382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13","html_url":"https://github.com/zhou13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
