Images saved to disk as log during validation (viz folder) sometimes include data that seems to belong to a different image. The first few images of each validation cycle look ok, but then a mismatch happens. For instance, vecl_a images look like the one below. However, ground truth and prediction data do seem to match.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n![000004_vecl_a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18498874/74233816-b7909780-4ccb-11ea-8220-cbfbb455f1d6.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zhou13","id":576382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13","html_url":"https://github.com/zhou13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
