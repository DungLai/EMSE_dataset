Pytorch 1.8.1 is installed with the instructions. But with that environment, the right points of lines get a little bit downward. But if I try the same with PyTorch 1.4.0 there is no issue. Can you please explain why is this happening? Or can you update the instructions for the correct PyTorch version? I have attached both outputs.
