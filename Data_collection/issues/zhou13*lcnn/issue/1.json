I want to run model on my own dataset, but I don't know how to organize my dataset.\r\n Firstly, I downloaded the pre-processed dataset from Google Drive, its size is about 8.1G. \r\nYou said that the wireframe.py is the script for pre-processing the Wireframe dataset to npz, but I couldn't find the necessary .json files from the pre-processed dataset,  so I failed to run  wireframe.py.  I want to know that do you have the raw dataset with .json files,  from which I can learn to organize my own dataset.\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"zhou13","id":576382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13","html_url":"https://github.com/zhou13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
