In the dict, I assume\r\n lmap:  line heatmap, but may I ask what the float value means? I thought it should be binary \r\n jmap:  junction heatmap\r\n joff:     junction offset map,\r\n\r\nbut I cannot understand what junc, Lpos,  Lneg ,  lpos, and  lneg  are. Especially, I found the the shape of  Lpos, Lneg is  n\\*2, while lpos and lneg has a shape n\\*2\\*3. \r\n\r\nCould you offer more explanation about them? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zhou13","id":576382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13","html_url":"https://github.com/zhou13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
