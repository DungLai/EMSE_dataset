I'm training to train the network using my own dataset and I have a few questions:\r\n1. In the config file \"wireframe.yaml\", the validation interval is set to 24000. If I understand correctly, this means that validation is run every 24000 times of iteration. Can I know the reason for this number? And why not run validation every epoch?\r\n2. I don't fully understand the loss part. What is the loss function for the network? Is it the weighted sum of jmap, lpos, lneg...?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nXin","closed_by":{"login":"zhou13","id":576382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13","html_url":"https://github.com/zhou13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhou13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zhou13/lcnn/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
