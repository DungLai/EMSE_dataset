Is this design on purpose?\r\n\r\nTo be specific, have a look at [this line of code](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/33edfc04c01ad19343946789fbb38d84ac45b3f1/blueoil/networks/segmentation/lm_segnet_v1.py#L66).\r\nThere is a `space_to_depth` call on the input?\r\n\r\nTwo problems:\r\n1. Bad neural network design.\r\n2. Input channels to `space_to_depth` not a multiple of 32.\r\n\r\nThe fixes would involve a conv layer (1x1) first that projects `channels=3` to `channels=32` and then putting a `space_to_depth`. Rest of the network is fine.","closed_by":{"login":"kalpitthakkar-lm","id":59547808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59547808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm","html_url":"https://github.com/kalpitthakkar-lm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalpitthakkar-lm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
