Based on the network architecture design there are 5 down sampling layer. This ended up in spatial dimension of the feature map on prediction layer `{[IMAGE_WIDTH / 32] x [IMAGE_HEIGHT / 32]}` also designated by variable `self.num_cell`. Which also control the distribution of the anchor boxes via `py_offset_boxes` function during processing `convert_boxes_space_from_real_to_yolo`. This results in anchor distribution for the original image size with tiled cell of size `32x32 px`. For smaller object ground truth boxes this may not be adequate.","closed_by":{"login":"ananno","id":3903030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDMwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3903030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno","html_url":"https://github.com/ananno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ananno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
