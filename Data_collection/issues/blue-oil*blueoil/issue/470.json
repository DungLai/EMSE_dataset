I think it is important to document what operations and parameters DLK can / cannot support. This can really help users/developers in designing the network and save a lot of time for debugging.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know, currently DLK has the following limitations:\r\n- No support for conv2d with kernel size not equal to 3x3 \r\n- No support for conv2d_transpose\r\n- No support for concat of mixed data types (e.g., quantized values and float values)\r\n- No support for space to depth if the output depth is not a multiple of 32\r\n- No support for depth to space if the input depth is not a multiple of 128\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"oatawa1","id":6939637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Mzk2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6939637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1","html_url":"https://github.com/oatawa1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
