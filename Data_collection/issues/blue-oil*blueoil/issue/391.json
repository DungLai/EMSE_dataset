That is 25% faster!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the input data for `network::Run()` is hard-coded to be `float *` but this is not good if Lookup() is going to be used. For that case, is better to generate the code in a way that if Lookup is detected then it should use `uint8_t *`. Because Lookup() always requires values in the range `[0-255]` so in this case is better to pass the raw pixels directly.\r\n\r\nI generated code for object detection and modified the generated project for checking and is faster as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n..Lookup 918,  sum:0.918ms\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I imagine that if we mixed this with @primenumber in-progress optimizations it could be even faster.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/391/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
