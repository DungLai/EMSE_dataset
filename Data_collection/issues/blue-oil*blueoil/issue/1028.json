And after that, I cannot run any inference which needs FPGA, these will be stuck too. I know that the Blueoil does not support parallel inferences. I only would like to know how to reset the FPGA state without a reboot. Is there a way to reset this state?\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce this situation\r\nIt is easy, run a following command on different terminal at the same time.\r\n```\r\npython run.py -i ../../inference_test_data/raw_image.png -c ../models/meta.yaml -m ../models/lib/libdlk_fpga.so --trial 100\r\n```\r\nIt will be stopped on `INFO:__main__:Function _run` part.\r\nAnd after that happened, we cannot run inference unless rebooting.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
