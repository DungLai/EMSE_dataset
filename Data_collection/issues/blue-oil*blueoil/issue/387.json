The issue with this is that it makes debugging difficult, especially for developers who might not be as familiar with the code. I think this should either be removed or changed into a flag. (Possibly something like `convert ... --verbose/-v`?)\r\n\r\nA second issue is that we always use `-j4`. This should be CPU dependent. We should either not use it, make it an optional flag with a default value, or investigate the CPU and set it based on that.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
