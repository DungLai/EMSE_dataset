We have several choice to solve the problem, but I don't know which one is the better choice:\r\n  - replace 3x3 conv with 1x1 conv, insert 3x3 quantized conv as 2nd conv layer.\r\n  - insert space2depth before the 1st layer.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tkng","id":96674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng","html_url":"https://github.com/tkng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
