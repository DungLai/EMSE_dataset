Also CI test is too heavy, doc is too complex.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, current `blueoil` should be separated into 3 parts, or 2.\r\n`blueoil` should only contain complier.\r\n`blueoil-quantization` contains `binary.py` and `linear.py`. Let user to import and use them in their codes.\r\n\r\nAnd then, something like `blueoil-net`, do training. (Or skip this. Let users to make pb by themselves. Just need to make sure all ops in graph are supported by `blueoil` and quantization ops are in graph. Use pre-checker to check the pb.)\r\n\r\nAs user, prepare a pb which use `blueoil-quantization` and compile it by `blueoil` should be a good idea.","closed_by":{"login":"tkng","id":96674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng","html_url":"https://github.com/tkng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
