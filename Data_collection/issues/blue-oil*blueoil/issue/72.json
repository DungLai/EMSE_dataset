Purpose\r\nWe can provide Blueoil with fixed docker image.\r\nAnd this makes easy to use Blueoil without source downloads and docker build.\r\nWe already set our first version `v0.1.0`, the time is coming for providing docker image.\r\n\r\n## Which repository\r\nBlueoil is OSS, so it is better to use dockerhub, everyone can access there.\r\n\r\n## How to deploy\r\nBecause of our Blueoil direstory structure, we cannot use auto-build of dockerhub.\r\nAnd dockerhub's auto-build is so slow, we should use another deployment.\r\nI am considering to use circleci or jenkins.","closed_by":{"login":"hadusam","id":12394960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzk0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12394960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam","html_url":"https://github.com/hadusam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
