const enum ResizeFilter filter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it should be like this (width and height are flipped).\r\n\r\n```\r\nTensor Resize(const Tensor& image, const int height, const int width, const enum ResizeFilter filter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis order depends on a rule of `meta.yaml` and the file should be common with python scripts.\r\nFor exaple, `run` in runtime and `run.py` need to use same `meta.yaml` but it's not possible now.\r\nSo the width and height order of Resize() should be flipped in
