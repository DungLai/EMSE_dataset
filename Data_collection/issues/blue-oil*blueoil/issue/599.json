for Ultra96v2\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n- [ ] Create Ultra96v2 Image with Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- [ ] Update Converter for aarch64 + fpga (Ultra96v2)\r\n- [ ] Add CI for Ultra96v2\r\n\r\n## Create Ultra96v2 Image with Ubuntu 18.04\r\nWe need the following files to create a SD card image\r\n* boot-loader\r\n  * u-boot files\r\n* OS related files\r\n  * raw_partition.img(rootfs)\r\n  * uImage.bin\r\n  *

Tasks\r\n- [x] Build rootfs #560 \r\n- [ ] Build uImage and kernel modules\r\n- [ ] Build boot.bin (FPGA files and boot-loader) and system.dtb and uEnv.txt for Ultra96v2\r\n- [ ] Create SD card image with all files\r\n- [ ] Upload new image for public and Update Documents for Ultra96v2\r\n- [ ] Modify code of converter to support Ultra96v2\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\nWhere should we put the generated above files?\r\nCurrent binary files for DE10-Nano is on this GitHub repository, but it is not a good method to manage binary
