Of course, removing those critical definition of memory addresses is better for us. Those manual selection should be replaced with automatic one.\r\nTo achieve the automatic selection, we can use `udmabuf` kernel modules. It'll select proper area from unused memory automatically.\r\n\r\nAnd if we use `udmabuf` kernel module instead of `/dev/mem`, we can limit the memory area to be used from user application. That's also good for the security.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
