Yet, In dataset `camvid.py`. class `0` is `sky`. It will be a fatal bug when applying `Rotate` on `camvid` training. It is better to define class `unlabelled` with `0` in all similar dataset loaders.\r\n- Since current implementation depends on `PIL.Image.rotate`, `Rotate` can not deal with mask which has channel size larger than 4.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
