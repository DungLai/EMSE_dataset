But BDD100K also comes with semantic segmentation dataset. In order to use BDD100K dataset for both object detection and segmentation separate dataset classes each for object detection and segmentation has to be implementted.\r\n\r\nAlso, BDD100k dataset file needs to be updated. Originally, the dataset comes with annotation as xml file per image. Recently, BDD changes the annotation format to JSON file one for train and one for test.
