Fortunately, we have only one Dockerfile for tensorflow-gpu, and we can set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` to skip using GPU without fatal errors.\r\nIt is a little bit strange solution(using `tensorflow-gpu` with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1`), but the requirements of tests are covered, and we are free from the rich GPU calculation environment.\r\nWithout GPUs, we can easily to parallelize tests to get results faster, this benefit is more important, I think ðŸ˜„","closed_by":{"login":"hadusam","id":12394960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzk0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12394960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam","html_url":"https://github.com/hadusam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/749/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
