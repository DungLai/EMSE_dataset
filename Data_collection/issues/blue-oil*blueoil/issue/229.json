If we change the bit value is necessary modify [dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/global.tpl.h](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/master/dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/global.tpl.h) file that have this line `#define NUM_OF_A2W1_THRESHOLD {{ 2**2 }}` with a fixed value. Then is necesary modify the `quantized_conv2d_kn2row.cpp` file for each architecture because the code are fixed to use only 2 bits.\r\n\r\nI already modify the `quantized_conv2d_kn2row.cpp` for x86 to accept different values (tested with `bit = 1 to 7 ` ), but the important one is FPGA, and I don't have the necessary background to understand the code, maybe someone can document better the code to explain what values are fixed and what is necessary do, to accept different bits quantizations.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
