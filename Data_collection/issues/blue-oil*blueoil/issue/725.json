This is a problem when submitting a job to a time-costed resource, because it will continue to eat up costly GPU resource for no benefit.\r\n\r\nI found this only occurred when using both multigpu and prefetch, so I believe it is due to pool processes being not able to close down. Also, if running only for a small number of steps, the bug does not happen, possibly because it is not enough time for pool processes to be built up.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce:\r\nRun training on ImageNet dataset, enable prefetch, run 4000 steps is enough to see the bug. To be specific, after cloning Blueoil, running 'make build', and creating ImageNet config, I ran this command:\r\n\r\ndocker run --runtime=nvidia -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0,1,2,3\" -e PYTHONPATH=.:lmnet:dlk/python/dlk --rm -v `pwd`:/home/blueoil -w /home/blueoil/lmnet -v <path_to_dataset>:/home/blueoil/lmnet/dataset:ro --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) <docker_image> horovodrun -np 4 python executor/train.py -c configs/core/classification/<imagenet_config_file>.py -i testpoolclosing --recreate\r\n\r\nThe training runs fine, reaches the end, but does not hangup.","closed_by":{"login":"joelN123","id":32167300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32167300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123","html_url":"https://github.com/joelN123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
