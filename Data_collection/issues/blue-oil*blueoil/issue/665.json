It is pretty troublesome to locate test input and output file such as `inference_test_data/000_images_placeholder:0.npy` etc.\r\nSo I think we would better copy `inference_test_data/000_images_placeholder:0.npy` and `inference_test_data/XXX_output:0.npy` into generated `model_name.prj` dir by default. (complete inference_test_data is too large)\r\nIt is intended to make testing and sharing easier.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/665/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
