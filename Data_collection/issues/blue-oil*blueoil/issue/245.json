think.\r\nBefore #223 , it used `shutil.copyfile`,and it was overwriting config files.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/5f679ee13283ff54ad336c79b9adf1250beca36a/blueoil/blueoil_train.py#L40-L47\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/5f679ee13283ff54ad336c79b9adf1250beca36a/lmnet/lmnet/utils/config.py#L274-L277\r\n\r\nSo, need to add `overwrite=True` to `gfile.Copy` to overwrite.\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gfile/Copy","closed_by":{"login":"iizukak","id":478824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODgyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak","html_url":"https://github.com/iizukak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
