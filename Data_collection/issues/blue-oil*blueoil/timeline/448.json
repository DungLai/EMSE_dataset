#448 \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe order of import statements is determined by PEP-8, currently we do not follow the rules. However, we do not have the intention of not following PEP-8. This is just a simple problem with the quality of our code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis pull request improve the order of import statements by using `isort`. Some files are not included in this pull request because I don't like the results of isort personally. What I don't prefer is that when there's too many symbols we want to import from one file, parentheses are used to span multiple lines. However, I want to split them into multiple statements.\r\n\r\n↓ what I don't prefer\r\n```\r\nfrom xxx import (aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd, eee...\r\n                 yyy, zzz)\r\n```\r\n↓ what I prefer\r\n```\r\nfrom xxx import aaa\r\nfrom xxx import bbb\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, now most files follow PEP-8. I'll make another pull request for the rest within the next week.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?
