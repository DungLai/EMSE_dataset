not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/445677628","html_url":"https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/64#issuecomment-445677628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/64","id":445677628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTY3NzYyOA==","user":{"login":"iizukak","id":478824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODgyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak","html_url":"https://github.com/iizukak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T04:37:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T04:37:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
