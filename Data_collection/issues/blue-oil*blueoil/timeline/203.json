I verified that `./blueoil.sh train` on segmentation task works well, and `label_colors` on tensorboard is correctly colored.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-03-27 at 19 51 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138891/55070604-fa547b80-50c9-11e9-85d9-76f975fb2818.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?
