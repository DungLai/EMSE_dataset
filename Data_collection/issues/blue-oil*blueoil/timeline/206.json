Burn our official OS image (from [here](https://docs.blue-oil.org/install/install.html#download-linux-system-image-on-your-pc)) to SD card\r\n1. Boot DE10-Nano with that SD card and setup NW configuration (e.g. configure static IP address)\r\n1. Clone git repo: `git clone --recursive -b dlk_test_for_local_fpga git@github.com:hadusam/blueoil.git`\r\n1. Run `FPGA_HOST=[IP address of your FPGA] make test-dlk` \r\n\r\nI changed to use python 2.7 to run tests on FPGA because current prepared OS image is not set up for python3 as default.\r\nI agree #206, but I decided to change the python version for tests on FPGA according to the current OS image setting.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n<!--- 🙆👌🙆 Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. 🙆👌🙆 -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, details of your manual tests, snippet code or commands of your manual tests, table of experiments results metrics, tests ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n<!--- If you have experiments report documents please link to here. -->\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?
