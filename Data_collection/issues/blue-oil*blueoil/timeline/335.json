would like to add new tests for AArch64 (related #335 )\r\nBut current DLK tests are very complicated.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we have many test cases of [test_code_generation.py](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/c3689d4e63b88d12c9a27291ee7a21cbe204bedf/dlk/tests/test_code_generation.py)\r\nThese tests create a binary file and run a script with binary on each x86_64, ARM and ARM_FPGA environment.\r\nIt is too difficult to understand what test cases are run, and too hard to add new devices for similar test cases.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these test cases are run.\r\n\r\n| Task | Model | x86_64 | ARM | ARM_FPGA |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| classification | lmnet_v1_group_conv | o | - | - |\r\n| classification | lmnet_quantize_cifar10 | o | - | - |\r\n| classification | lmnet_quantize_cifar10_space_to_depth | o | o | o |\r\n| classification | resnet_quantize_cifar10 | o | o | o |\r\n| object_detection | fyolo_quantize_4_v4 | o | o | o |\r\n| object_detection | widerface_320 | - | o | - |\r\n| object_detection | widerface_v5 | - | o | - |\r\n| segmentation | lm_segnet_v1_quantize_camvid | o | - | - |\r\n\r\nWow, segmentation task is not tested on ARM, FPGA 😭 \r\n\r\nThese Models are found on [dlk/examples](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/tree/master/dlk/examples) directory, and these `.pb` files are too old, so we should update and replace them!\r\n\r\nI am planning to make the latest `.pb` files of current stable networks supported by blueoil (ref: [blueoil/blueoil_init.py](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/master/blueoil/blueoil_init.py#L33-L56)).\r\nSo the test cases will be as follows.\r\n \r\n| Task | Model | x86_64 | ARM | ARM_FPGA |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| classification | LmnetV1Quantize | o | o | o |\r\n| classification | ResNetQuantize | o | o | o |\r\n| object_detection | LMFYoloQuantize | o | o | o |\r\n| segmentation | LmSegnetV1Quantize | o | o | o
