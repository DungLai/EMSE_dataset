For `contrib`, the operator needs to be replaced carefully. Others may not be too difficult.\r\n\r\n(*1)`contrib` is deprecated in tf2. `tf_upgrade_v2` does not make any changes. We need to change to another layer manually. For example, the following contrib layer are included:\r\n* tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm\r\n* tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected\r\n* tf.contrib.layers.dropout\r\n* tf.contrib.layers.separable_conv2d\r\n\r\n`dlk` may not be able to be converted by replacing `contrib` with a similar layer.\r\nWe need to choose a layer that dlk supports. The accuracy also may decrease due to the change. We need to re-train the model check the accuracy after the replacements. This part can be difficult.\r\n\r\n(*2) The conversion of three directories and files resulted in an error that stopped processing. \r\n```\r\npasta.base.annotate.AnnotationError: Expected ':' but found 'metaclass'\r\nline 24: class Base(metaclass=ABCMeta):\r\n```\r\nIt can be converted by removing the metaclass and executing the process.\r\n\r\n(*3) Since `tf_upgrade_v2` may not support `*.tpl.py` file, it becomes invalid syntax and processing stops. We need to check the changes in the configs folder and change them manually.\r\n```\r\nERROR: Failed to parse.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

What this patch does to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI converted only the blueoil/datasets with the command line tool tf_upgrade_v2 to run on tensorflow2.\r\n\r\nThere is a code (\"metaclass = ABCMeta\", \"yield from\") that tf_upgrade_v2 cannot support, so I change it once, convert it, and restore it again.\r\n\r\nHere's what I did:\r\n1. install newest tenosrflow (tensorflow-gpu==1.5.2)\r\n2. Change once to convert tf_upgrade_v2 https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/commit/8c6db677bcf777a8ca086e7c42c2a404ae8eaadb\r\n3. Run the upgrade script tf_upgrade_v2 https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/commit/8e31b9c24be94a469fc9ef2f3bbe8bf505ba0cd3\r\n4. Undo changes in 2 https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/commit/1eedf628d2515d0b939a2f3fac615e10a4f5dc64\r\n5. Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors\r\n6. Run test (make test)\r\n\r\nThe only change this time is also to replace the operator with compat.v1.\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n* #479 \r\n*

I change the generating module manually.\r\n2.

What this patch does to fix the issue.\r\nI have realized that output_template has a python file using TensorFlow (output_template/python/lmnet/tensorflow_graph_runner.py)\r\n\r\nThis patch makes output_template/python/lmnet/tensorflow_graph_runner.py compatible with tf2\r\n\r\nHere's what I did:\r\n1. install newest tenosrflow (tensorflow-gpu==1.5.2)\r\n2. Run the upgrade script tf_upgrade_v2 for `output_template`\r\n3. Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors\r\n4. Run test (make test)\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n* #479 \r\n*

Run the upgrade script tf_upgrade_v2\r\n3. Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors\r\n4.
