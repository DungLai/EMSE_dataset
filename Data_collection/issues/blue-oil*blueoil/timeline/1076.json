is to fix the bug described in issue https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1076\r\n\r\nThe error occurs because when running convert, the [_saved_config_file_path](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/f57ccf6af2b5fd8210ba255a6ce46e868d9c2677/blueoil/utils/config.py#L64) function will retrieve the `config.py` file, and it will try to access `classes` property of the dataset class. However, the dataset hasn't been instantiated, so it can't access the class names.\r\n\r\nOne way around it is to create a dummy dataset, and use the `classes` property of that. But it adds a few lines of code, and creating a dummy dataset only for this purpose is not ideal.\r\n\r\nAnother way (the way in this PR), is to prefer to load `config.yaml`, rather than `config.py`. The `config.yaml` has the full class names directly listed because of [this existing code](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/f57ccf6af2b5fd8210ba255a6ce46e868d9c2677/blueoil/utils/config.py#L224), which is run when doing training.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is very simple, just swapping `config.py` and `config.yaml` in one line changes the order of preference for which one to use (only one is used, not both).\r\n\r\np.s. [\"'config.yaml' is duplication of python config file as yaml.\"](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/blob/f57ccf6af2b5fd8210ba255a6ce46e868d9c2677/blueoil/utils/config.py#L242) so it seems fine to prefer `config.yaml` over `config.py` when running the conversion.\r\n\r\nI tested it by doing training and converting a model similar to `lm_resnet.py`, for Ilsvrc2012 dataset. By doing the change shown in this PR, it could convert.\r\n\r\np.s. the original issue mentions DarknetQuantize. However, after doing the fix in this PR, I still get an error when converting it `AssertionError: Pooling operator pool_1_MaxPool does not match the height: 224 vs 112.` I am pretty sure it is a different error, not related to the issue of loading class names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
