At least, I think that I would find it helpful. I started using the [tf.compat.v1.profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/profiler) (more details in [tensorflow/core/profiler/g3doc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/profiler/g3doc)). The output timeline can be viewed by chrome://tracing. The image below is an example of training lmnet_v1.py for CIFAR-100.\r\n\r\n![sample_output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32167300/83704624-93c3d980-a64d-11ea-836d-df15489410e8.png)\r\n\r\nIt's not got much info on the time used for fetching/augmenting inputs. The [newer version profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) seems to do more. But, [it can only be used in TensorFlow 2.2 or higher](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras). So, we should remember to upgrade the profiler after upgrading to 2.2 or higher.\r\n\r\nFor now, I would like to include the tf.compat.v1.profiler. One point I'm not sure about is whether to have a command line option for `train.py`, or an extra flag for the config file. Increasing the number of command-line options could cause the basic interface to become more difficult to understand, maybe? So, it feels like it is better to include as a flag to the config file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/638550880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joelN123","id":32167300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32167300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123","html_url":"https://github.com/joelN123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/638552527","html_url":"https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/482#issuecomment-638552527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/482","id":638552527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODU1MjUyNw==","user":{"login":"iizukak","id":478824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODgyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak","html_url":"https://github.com/iizukak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iizukak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-04T01:48:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T01:48:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@joelN123

What this patch does to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n1.  Include function for profiling the train step.\r\n2.  Command-line option for choosing which train step to profile.\r\n\r\nThe command-line arg `profile_step` can optionally be used to pass a value for the train step at which to use [tf/compat/v1/profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/profiler). If this option is not used, the profiler is not used.\r\n\r\nWhen the profiler option is used, the profiler will calculate the resource used for operations (including gradient), during the single train step. It outputs this information in two files (memory and time resource). This train profile is helpful for seeing what are the size and time bottlenecks of training.\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n\r\nDirectly related to issue https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/482\r\n\r\nAs said in the linked issue, a main weak point is that tf/compat/v1/profiler lacks info on the fetching/augmenting of inputs. The [newer version profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) seems to do more. But, [it can only be used in TensorFlow 2.2 or higher](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras). So, for now I use tf/compat/v1/profiler. Then later (after upgrading to TF2.2 or higher), we can consider upgrading the profiler.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways that the TF1 profiler can be used. I tried a few of them, and settled on the way in this PR, as it seemed the most simple and to give most of the useful information. But, there are other ways it could be done, (for more info [core/profiler/g3doc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/profiler/g3doc) and [tf/compat/v1/profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/profiler)).\r\n\r\n## More detail\r\n\r\nWith the code in this PR, it is possible to profile on whichever train step, including summary step. The summary step actually gives a slightly different result compared to a generic train step. The heatmap is the main difference on the summary step? Anyway, I thought it's good to also allow to profile the summary step if someone wants to do that. p.s. I didn't include functionality to profile the test step.\r\n\r\nsome detail on what it looks like for the user:\r\n\r\nusing command:\r\n```\r\ndocker run --runtime=nvidia -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0\" -e PYTHONPATH=.:lmnet:dlk/python/dlk --rm -v `pwd`:/home/blueoil -w /home/blueoil -v <path to dataset dir>:/home/blueoil/dataset:ro --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) <docker image> python blueoil/cmd/main.py train -c blueoil/configs/core/classification/lmnet_quantize_cifar100.py -e testing123 --recreate --profile_step 28\r\n```\r\nwe get this message at step 28:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/pyenv/versions/python3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/profiler/internal/flops_registry.py:142: tensor_shape_from_node_def_name (from tensorflow.python.framework.graph_util_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\r\nInstructions for updating:\r\nUse `tf.compat.v1.graph_util.tensor_shape_from_node_def_name`\r\nParsing Inputs...\r\n\r\n******************************************************\r\nTimeline file is written to /home/blueoil/saved/testing123/training_profile_timeline_step_28.\r\nOpen a Chrome browser, enter URL chrome://tracing and load the timeline file.\r\n******************************************************\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, I don't like the message being there. But I'm not sure how it can be removed.\r\n\r\nNow the profiler has been run, we get files `training_profile_memory` and `training_profile_timeline_step_28` in `saved/testing123` directory. The first file can be inspected as a normal file (shows the memory of ops). The second is a json file that can be viewed as a timeline by typing `chrome://tracing` in a chrome browser (shows the time taken for ops).\r\n\r\nThe `training_profile_memory` looks like this:\r\n\r\n[memory_profile_sample.txt](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/files/4844345/memory_profile_sample.txt)\r\n\r\nThe `training_profile_timeline_step_28` looks like this:\r\n\r\n![profile_time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32167300/85984570-52dc9c00-ba24-11ea-8b41-3647b2b5a2fb.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3497275259,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0OTcyNzUyNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3497275259","actor":{"login":"bo-mergebot[bot]","id":57979542,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTc5Nzk1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43470236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bo-mergebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3e7fab9ad1833f58e6df661d12552c663d1e3e5c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/commits/3e7fab9ad1833f58e6df661d12552c663d1e3e5c","created_at":"2020-06-30T11:24:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/655924766","html_url":"https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/482#issuecomment-655924766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/482","id":655924766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTkyNDc2Ng==","user":{"login":"joelN123","id":32167300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32167300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123","html_url":"https://github.com/joelN123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelN123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-09T06:16:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T06:16:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The feature is now merged.
