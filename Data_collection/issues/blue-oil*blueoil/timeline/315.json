Since it is sending [`SIGTERM`](https://pracucci.com/graceful-shutdown-of-kubernetes-pods.html)  signals to the main process to not to lose certain checkpoints if the training was terminated.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure if this really works when a Kubernetes pod is being gracefully shutdown so it might need more tests in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- 📝🎯📝 Describe your changes in detail. 📝🎯📝 -->\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n<!--- 🙆👌🙆 Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. 🙆👌🙆 -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, details of your manual tests, snippet code or commands of your manual tests, table of experiments results metrics, tests ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n<!--- If you have experiments report documents please link to here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run the following command both on lmnet and blueoil commands\r\n\r\nLmnet example\r\n$ PYTHONPATH=. python executor/train.py -c configs/example/classification.py\r\n\r\nBlueoil example\r\n$ ./blueoil.sh train config/cifar10.yml\r\n\r\n> press `ctrl+c` when the training starts that shows the current step in the terminal.\r\n> After keyboard interrupt command, it should save the current checkpoint of your training before it terminates.\r\n\r\nI also added a unit test file to check if signal handler works.\r\n[test_signal_handler.py](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/pull/316/files#diff-022bf5172d327b83257f59429fc23ce3)\r\n\r\nWIP: Test on k8s and post the results and how to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?
