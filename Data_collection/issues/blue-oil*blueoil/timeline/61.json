We fork `update-tf-version` branch and create the PR to merge into `update-tf-version` by each task for updating tensorflow. (may not need to pass tests)\r\n2. After completing the development to upgrade, we will merge that branch into master.\r\n\r\nAnother selection, we can select directly pushing into `update-tf-version`.\r\nWhat do you think? @ruimashita
