But it use the `kernel_initializer` via `conv2d` layer. As I showed in the code block above, current implementation of `code2d` function doesn't pass `kernel_initializer` argument into the `tf.layers.conv2d` function. Please check the 2nd code block above. \r\n\r\nAm I misunderstanding? :thinking:

👉👉👉 Provide a general summary of your changes. 👈👈👈 -->\r\nTo fix the kernel initializer issue in function `conv2d` in `lmnet/lmnet/layers.py`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- 💭💡💭 Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? 💭💡💭 -->\r\n<!--- 🔗 If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. 🔗 -->\r\nThe argument definition of `kernel_initializer` of the function `conv2d` in `lmnet/lmnet/layers/layers.py` has never been passed into `tf.layers.conv2d` function call resulting it not effective even if it is passed from the calling function. This change is necessary to pass the parameters in `tf.layers.conv2d` function by defining and passing arguments like `kernel_initializer` or `kernel_regularizer` etc.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- 📝🎯📝 Describe your changes in detail. 📝🎯📝 -->\r\nThe `kernel_initializer` argument is defined in the function argument of `conv2d` but never passed in `tf.layers.conv2d` function in the code body. This results to not passing the kernel regularizer defined or passed by the calling function. \r\n\r\nThe fix is very simple. By removing the argument definition in `conv2d` function in `lmnet/lmnet/layers/layers.py` file. The defined argument like `kernel_initializer` or any others supported by `tf.layers.conv2d` function can be automatically passed via `*args, **kwargs`.\r\n\r\nDetails discussion on this is documented in issue [here](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/362).\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n<!--- 🙆👌🙆 Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. 🙆👌🙆 -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, details of your manual tests, snippet code or commands of your manual tests, table of experiments results metrics, tests ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n<!--- If you have experiments report documents please link to here. -->\r\nFrom the code it is obvious that the argument definition of `kernel_initializer` in `conv2d` function has never been used.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3903030/61017452-3a681180-a3ce-11e9-8168-4001adcc2a9e.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?
