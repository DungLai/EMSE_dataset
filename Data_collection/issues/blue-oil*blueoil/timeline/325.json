Problems\r\nCurrent CI environment is too slow(35 min) and no scalability. #193\r\nWe need to paralyze tests to improve the speed of development but not so easy with current Jenkins environment.\r\nAnd also Blueoil needs specified environments with some devices (GPUs, FPGAs...) by each test cases.\r\nSo we need to prepare a more scalable and flexible environment for Blueoil tests.\r\n\r\n## What to do\r\nJenkins is a powerful CI software and we are using this now.\r\nBut we decided to move [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) for Blueoil CI environments.\r\nBuildkite has these specifications,\r\n* Easy extendable pipeline based settings (ex. dynamic pipeline upload).\r\n* Only run on self-deployed agent by user (No prepared hosted agents)\r\n* Easy to deploy agents anywhere (On-premise, Cloud, k8s)\r\n* Free for OSS\r\n\r\nYour can see specification of buildkite as follow article: [Hacker News Ref](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17246453) (I agree with
