\r\n\r\nThe problem might come from lack of amount of memory.\r\nIf you use -j2 option, two compilations are running at the same time.\r\nThe problem might not occur when you use server for compilation because it has enough memory.\r\nAnd your model which you're trying to compile on DE10-Nano might consume much memory.\r\n\r\nThis is my expectation and I'm not sure what is the really problem.\r\nYou can check consumed memory on DE10-Nano to know more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/629976838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tk26eng","id":35796618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk2NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35796618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng","html_url":"https://github.com/tk26eng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3345759313,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0NTc1OTMxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3345759313","actor":{"login":"lm-jira","id":43122237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIyMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43122237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira","html_url":"https://github.com/lm-jira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T06:37:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3345759314,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDU3NTkzMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3345759314","actor":{"login":"lm-jira","id":43122237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTIyMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43122237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira","html_url":"https://github.com/lm-jira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lm-jira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T06:37:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
