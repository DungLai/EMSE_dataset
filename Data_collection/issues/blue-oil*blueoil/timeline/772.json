that's a good point, I agree about this, it would be good to specify the type of resampling.

So maybe we should specify that one.\r\nIt's interesting, in [release note 2.7.0](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/2.7.0.html#resize-performance), they say the quality of `NEAREST` is close to `BICUBIC`. But in [release note 7.0.0](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/7.0.0.html#default-resampling-filter), they say `NEAREST` is fast but low
