I've tested.\r\n\r\nMoreover, If I generate a `1280x720` PNG images with random pixel values it takes about `2.3MB`. We need about 9 PNG images and 6 JPG images total. So it becomes `~20MB`.\r\n\r\nSo, I created one `1280x720` JPG images with 1% quality which is `16KB` and one `1280x720` PNG from that low quality JPG image which is `~600KB`. And I created symlink with different names to appropriate places. Total `BDD100K` fixture directory becomes `728KB`.\r\n\r\nI think it is a very good result. :smiley:
