@masato0412\r\nOK, after given some thoughts, I think this is what happened (assuming the mAP calculation is correct)\r\n1. confidence score threshold lower\r\n2. a lot of low-confidence boxes all count as prediction\r\n3. since there are a lot of \"random boxes\", precision goes to 0%, and recall goes to 100%\r\n4. however, for mAP, this only mean we have more sampling points on the right side of precision_x_recall curve, and have better approximation of real curve there.\r\n5. area under curve (mAP) increases slightly due to better approximation\r\n\r\nreference:

it looks like there are some low score boxes that actually were correct? Maybe it is good to lower that threshold... Another point is that maybe the non-maximum suppression will have to do more work because there are more boxes to compare (NMS is used after excluding low scores).
