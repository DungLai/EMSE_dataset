What this patch does to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains replacement of the current `Jet` colormap of matplotlib by adding the Google proposed [Turbo Colormap](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html) as highlighted in #485 by @tk26eng in `blueoil/common.py`. \r\n\r\nThis colormap is for replacing the `Jet` colormap in matplotlib that is used for coloring heatmaps. So I added a new function that takes the heatmap as input and then returns the colored heatmap. As the function uses numpy, it should be called using `tf.py_func` interface.\r\n\r\nThe table for reference colors is a (256x3) matrix of sRGB colors and I saved it to a separate file `blueoil/turbo_color_map.py`.\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n\r\nRelevant issue: #485 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/1055/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3542432733,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NDI0MzI3MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3542432733","actor":{"login":"bo-mergebot[bot]","id":57979542,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTc5Nzk1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43470236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bo-mergebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08bf6c1f9c8bedf7ab686f680c58232276f8cad5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/commits/08bf6c1f9c8bedf7ab686f680c58232276f8cad5","created_at":"2020-07-14T04:46:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
