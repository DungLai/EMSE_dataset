What this patch does to fix the issue.\r\nPrevious code set the validation dataset directory to `''`, thus when the configuration file generate  `validation_extend_dir` = `''`. So the blueoil train recognize it has validation dataset in the default directory. (if dir is the **relative path** it refers to `default path` **not** `current path`.)\r\n\r\n This commit changes the validation dataset directory to `None`. So it will not generate `validation_extend_dir` in the configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Link to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\nCloses #964 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3229179538,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyMjkxNzk1Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3229179538","actor":{"login":"bo-mergebot[bot]","id":57979542,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTc5Nzk1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43470236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bo-mergebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bo-mergebot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3ebc0b4f50505fe3c2666be069b9699bb74a5633","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/commits/3ebc0b4f50505fe3c2666be069b9699bb74a5633","created_at":"2020-04-14T02:01:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3229261098,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzIyOTI2MTA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3229261098","actor":{"login":"oatawa1","id":6939637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Mzk2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6939637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1","html_url":"https://github.com/oatawa1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oatawa1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-14T02:47:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
