Motivation and Context\r\nThis PR is based on #133 \r\n\r\nWe can pre-compute `scale` and `shift` which is used in batch normalization.\r\nSo implement and add new optimization pass. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n　@antonionevado and @nlpng and I implement this PR.\r\n　calculate `shift` and `scale` from `gamma`, `beta`, `mean`, `variance`, `epsilon` in advance.\r\n　and make template file to fit new interface.\r\n　and separate .cpp and .h for batch norm for readability.\r\n\r\nmodified:\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/operators.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/optimizer.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/core/view.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/scripts/generate_project.py\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/CMakeLists.txt\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/Makefile.tpl\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/func/batch_normalization.h\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/include/func/multadd.h\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/func/batch_normalization.cpp\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/func/multadd.cpp\r\n　dlk/python/dlk/templates/src/network.tpl.cpp\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\nrun on X86 / ARM / FPGA\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature / Optimization (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/574995594","html_url":"https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/133#issuecomment-574995594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/133","id":574995594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDk5NTU5NA==","user":{"login":"primenumber","id":1918373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTgzNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1918373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber","html_url":"https://github.com/primenumber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primenumber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T05:53:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T05:53:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"solved
