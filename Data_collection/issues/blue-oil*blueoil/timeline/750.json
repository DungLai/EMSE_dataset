See [TensorFlow Official Doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/fused-batch-norm-v3).\r\nWhen converting with GPU, the behavior is the same as one before this change.\r\n\r\nI also removed `save_npy_for_debug=False` option from the e2e test, this option was for avoiding the error of #750, so we can remove it and test saving `npy` files.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n<!--- 🙆👌🙆 Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. 🙆👌🙆 -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, details of your manual tests, snippet code or commands of your manual tests, table of experiments results metrics, tests ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n<!--- If you have experiments report documents please link to here. -->\r\nI tested that `lm_x86.elf` can run without middle layers output files.\r\n```\r\n$ lm_x86.elf 000_images_placeholder\\:0.npy 139_output\\:0.npy\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nComparison: Default network test  succeeded!!!\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTotalInitTime 10638,  sum:10.638ms\r\nTotalRunTime 433879,  sum:433.879ms\r\n..Convolution 21327,139,  sum:21.466ms\r\n....kn2row 21197,  sum:21.197ms\r\n......kn2row-buf 0,  sum:0ms\r\n......matrix_multiplication 379,269,268,268,268,267,267,269,273,268,269,267,269,267,268,1297,269,269,269,268,268,268,269,268,268,271,269,267,268,267,273,268,269,269,268,268,268,268,267,268,267,268,267,272,268,268,269,268,269,267,268,268,268,267,267,267,285,268,268,269,268,268,268,269,  sum:18.328ms\r\n......matrix_shift_add_f1 5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,  sum:0.262ms\r\n......matrix_shift_add_f2 33,40,39,39,39,39,38,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,40,39,49,39,39,40,39,39,38,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,41,39,39,39,39,38,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,38,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,40,39,39,39,39,32,  sum:2.495ms\r\n....kn2row-1x1 138,  sum:0.138ms\r\n......matrix_multiplication 135,  sum:0.135ms\r\n..BatchNorm 931,29,  sum:0.96ms\r\n..QTZ_linear_mid_tread_half 2764,  sum:2.764ms\r\n....pack_input 1419,  sum:1.419ms\r\n..QuantizedConv2D 69793,225071,57454,54718,1483,  sum:408.519ms\r\n....Convert Tensor 19,43,18,7,3,  sum:0.09ms\r\n....quantized-kn2row 69772,225026,57435,54709,1479,  sum:408.421ms\r\n......quantized_matrix_multiplication 1057,1003,999,998,997,1001,998,998,1004,1007,997,998,1000,998,998,998,1000,997,997,998,1004,998,997,997,999,998,997,998,1003,998,998,998,1005,998,997,998,997,998,997,999,998,998,997,1004,997,997,997,1001,997,998,998,1004,997,998,997,1000,997,998,997,1000,998,997,999,998,14044,14057,13983,13986,15007,13988,14878,13983,13910,13596,13519,13476,13483,13518,13478,13474,3387,3383,3385,3384,3389,3384,3385,4355,3383,3384,3382,3385,3384,4251,3387,3385,13505,13480,13480,13517,1468,  sum:397.802ms\r\n......matrix_shift_add1 8,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,28,25,25,24,25,25,25,25,25,24,23,24,24,23,24,24,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,48,46,45,45,  sum:1.162ms\r\n......matrix_shift_add2 32,35,35,35,35,35,34,34,35,35,35,35,34,34,34,34,35,34,34,34,34,34,34,35,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,35,35,35,38,35,34,34,34,34,34,34,35,34,35,34,35,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,29,51,54,51,51,58,51,51,51,50,49,50,49,49,50,49,46,31,33,33,33,33,33,33,33,34,33,33,33,33,33,33,31,47,49,49,48,  sum:3.719ms\r\n......ApplyThresholds 1553,783,376,189,  sum:2.901ms\r\n......pack bits 1172,571,285,142,  sum:2.17ms\r\n......Convert Tensor 38,13,9,3,8,  sum:0.071ms\r\n..Memcpy 31,18,9,5,  sum:0.063ms\r\n..ExtractImagePatches 32,8,4,  sum:0.044ms\r\n..QuantizedConv2D_ApplyScalingFactor 10,  sum:0.01ms\r\n..ReLu 8,  sum:0.008ms\r\n..Add 3,  sum:0.003ms\r\n..AveragePool 2,  sum:0.002ms\r\n..SoftMax 15,  sum:0.015ms\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- 🏁🎌🏁 What types of changes does your code introduce?

#789, we can run convert without GPU 🎉 \r\n\r\nBTW, I found our docker image can run without GPU by setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` or removing `nvidia` runtime from docker running option. 😮 \r\nSo I think we already have a docker image for running on CPU without GPU env. 😄 \r\n\r\nI will add some document about how to run without GPU and after that, I will close this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/582710747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hadusam","id":12394960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzk0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12394960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam","html_url":"https://github.com/hadusam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3345930201,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzMzQ1OTMwMjAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/events/3345930201","actor":{"login":"hadusam","id":12394960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzk0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12394960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam","html_url":"https://github.com/hadusam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadusam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T07:27:55Z","assignee":{"login":"tk26eng","id":35796618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk2NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35796618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng","html_url":"https://github.com/tk26eng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/comments/645136597","html_url":"https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/750#issuecomment-645136597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/750","id":645136597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTEzNjU5Nw==","user":{"login":"tk26eng","id":35796618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk2NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35796618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng","html_url":"https://github.com/tk26eng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk26eng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T04:10:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T04:10:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hadusam
