augmentors edit the images without modifying the coordinate of bounding boxes (gt_boxes variables), which is reported by [this issue](https://github.com/blue-oil/blueoil/issues/60).\r\nThis pull request changes the coordinate of bounding boxes for those augmentors.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nEditing images without changing coordinate of bounding boxes results in incorrect data label for training data and affects the accuracy of object detection model\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nEdit pad and crop data augmentor classes to accept `gt_boxes` as an input,\r\nmodify the coordinate of `gt_boxes` according to the way images are modified,\r\nand return the correct information of `gt_boxes`.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\nI tested it using the same setting as Blueoil's object detection tutorial, which is detecting human face and hand using a part of OpenImagesV4 dataset.\r\nI implemented on server25.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nThe example of bounding boxes in augmented image is as follows.\r\n<img width=\"370\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-01-11 at 16 43 47\"
