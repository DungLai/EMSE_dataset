This implementation uses lock-free gradient descent.\r\n2. It runs in parallel in every phase (feature creation and learning). This makes it massively scalable -- You can easily create an embedding for 100 million graphs under an hour on an industry-grade server.\r\n3. The implementation uses the hashing trick to keep the memory footprint of the algorithm linear in the number of edges (this does not affect the runtime.).\r\n\r\nThis Graph2Vec version is part of the Karate Club package, which can be cited as:\r\n\r\n@misc{rozemberczki2020karateclub,\r\ntitle = {Karate Club: A tool for unsupervised learning on graph structured data.},\r\nauthor = {Benedek
