This model only works when You have a single string feature. However, You can generalize it to multi feature cases (for string/categorical features). If You extract WL node features for each node feature separately (You can rewrite it easily) -- each string feature must get a \"feature_x_\" prefix. The feature extraction and optimization runtime will be exactly multiplied by the number of features (assuming no down sampling). May I ask what is the exact use case?\r\n\r\n2. Yes you can make it work for an inductive setting if all of the node features have been seen up to that point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/comments/443728928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/comments/443734420","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/3#issuecomment-443734420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/3","id":443734420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzczNDQyMA==","user":{"login":"john-wick-ksg","id":45565542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTY1NTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45565542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg","html_url":"https://github.com/john-wick-ksg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-wick-ksg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-03T14:45:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T14:45:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\n1.
