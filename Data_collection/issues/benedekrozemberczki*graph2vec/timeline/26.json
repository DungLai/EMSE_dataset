If you do not have a min count noisy features will be present. If you set it too high everything will be pruned back (it is controlling the columns included in the factorization process).\r\n\r\n2. If you have a too large number of WL iterations each node will have unique features with translates to columns with a single non zero value during the factorization.\r\n\r\n3. You can have a nested hash map with node keys, feature name keys and feature values.
