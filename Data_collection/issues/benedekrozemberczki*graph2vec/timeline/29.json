The number of rows in this matrix is the number of graphs and the number of columns is the number of unique WL features for all of the graphs. The number of dimensions is the number of basis vectors used for the factorization. You can look at the Graph2Vec paper for more details. I would recommend the use of the Karate Club implementation of Graph2Vec.  \r\n\r\nPlease do not forget to star the repos.\r\n\r\nBests,\r\n\r\nBenedek","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/comments/741745839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4089733637,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDA4OTczMzYzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/events/4089733637","actor":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-09T12:41:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
