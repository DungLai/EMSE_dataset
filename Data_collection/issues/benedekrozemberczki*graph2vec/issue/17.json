The features are nide degrees as suggested in the paper, I only modified the number of epochs making it 40. \r\nLet's say I now have embeddings 1, 2 and 3 of the same set of graphs (so graph2vec applied 3 times on the same data).\r\nThen I tried to calculate map@5 for retrieval of the most similar embeddings between the embeddings 1 and 3, 1 and 2, 3 and 2. And I got really bad results, precisely map@5: 0.249222, 0.260222, 0.163278.\r\nI got similar negative results using the dataset provided and default parameters. \r\nPlease, can you comment on that or let me know what I might be doing wrong? \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
