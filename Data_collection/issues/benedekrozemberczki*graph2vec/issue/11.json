I was looking through the code after I applied this to my own dataset and noticed a potential issue with the calculation of the label multiset in the WeisfeilerLehmanMachine.\r\n\r\nIn the [original paper](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/genWLpaper.pdf) they provide this figure to explain one iteration of the relabeling process(p. 10): \r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-28 at 2 12 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5107405/62011148-9064e500-b142-11e9-8067-32678cea8278.png\">\r\n\r\nIn particular, the node with label `4` in the left graph has a pre-hashed label of `4,1135` - meaning it's original label is `4`, and the multiset representation of its neighbors labels is `1135`\r\n\r\nI think there's an issue in how this multiset is calculated in the `WeisfeilerLehmanMachine` class, specifically this line: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/blob/master/src/graph2vec.py#L42 \r\n \r\nI've got a simple reproduction of this logic here. I am expecting the output to be `4_1_1_3_5`, however, I get:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> node_label = \"4\"\r\n>>> neighbor_labels = [\"5\", \"3\", \"1\", \"1\"]\r\n>>> features = \"_\".join([node_label] + list(set(sorted([str(n) for n in neighbor_labels]))))\r\n>>> print(features)\r\n4_5_1_3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe you can fix this by removing the creation of the set, I'm not sure that's doing what we want. Since sets are [unordered collections of objects](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset), we are effectively ordering the objects with `sorted` and then unordering them with `set`.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong as I didn't evaluate the full pipliene here - there maybe some other change in the input to this function that does give you the correct answer, but I think this part of the implementation is worth another look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
