Strong work!\r\n\r\nConcerning this graph2vec algorithm... At first glance, it seems identical to the rdf2vec algorithm (with the Weisfeiler-Lehman extension), except for the fact that this algorithm cannot deal with named edges (only named nodes). Am I correct, or is there a significant difference that I am currently not seeing?\r\n\r\nAlso, nice implementation of the WL relabeling! \r\n\r\nThanks and kind regards,\r\nGilles","closed_by":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
