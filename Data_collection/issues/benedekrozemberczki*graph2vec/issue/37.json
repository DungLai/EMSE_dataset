Running the script would return this error:\r\n\r\n`'DegreeView' object has no attribute 'items'`\r\n\r\nI'm not the most experienced programmer so I could be wrong here but I think in networkx 2.4 `networkx.Graph.degree` returns an iterable and not a dict. So in line 72 of `graph2vec.py`, I had to consider the case when `features` was an iterable so I changed `features.items()` to `list(features)`. And this worked for input dictionaries with no feature key so it now looks like:\r\n```\r\nif \"features\" in data.keys():\r\n    features = data[\"features\"]\r\n    features = {int(k): v for k, v in features.items()}\r\nelse:\r\n    features = nx.degree(graph)\r\n    features = {int(k): v for k, v in list(features)}\r\n```\r\nMaybe I'm completely wrong but just in case anyone else had the same issue this might help since this worked for me.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/blob/a2001d0d6595d082635f2e75fa7275ad0690ff70/src/graph2vec.py#L72","closed_by":{"login":"benedekrozemberczki","id":17380887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzgwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17380887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benedekrozemberczki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
