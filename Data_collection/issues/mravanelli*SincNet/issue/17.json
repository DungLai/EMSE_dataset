However, I believe to reproduce the LibriSpeech results, I'll need a bit more information if you don't mind. I've currently downloaded the clean 100 and 360 hour datasets as well as the 500 hour \"other\" dataset. This has about 100 fewer speakers than the number you reference in your paper. Could you provide the names of the Libri datasets from which you drew your speakers?\r\n\r\nHow did you preprocess them? I know in the paper you mention using only 12-15s for training. Did you just taking the first 15s of each utterance (or less if the utterance was shorter)?  If not, could you explain how you arrived at the training utterances as well as the preprocessing you've done?\r\n\r\nCould you also provide the training/testing data lists similar to TIMIT_train.scp and TIMIT_test.scp?\r\n\r\nAgain, this is aimed at trying to reproduce the Libri results, so as much specificity as possible would be great!\r\n\r\nThanks for all you've done!","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
