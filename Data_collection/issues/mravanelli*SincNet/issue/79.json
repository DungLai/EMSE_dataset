However, we could not reproduce the curves in the paper. \r\n\r\nHere is what we achieved.  Even though there is a clear valley from 2k to 2.5k Hz,  a huge decay around 500 Hz always exists, which is different from the figures in your paper. Besides, this 500 Hz valley exists even when no noise is added to the input. And we could not find the reason behind it. \r\n\r\n![frequency response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57004778/70439282-915e3980-1a87-11ea-9a3b-32cb916931e3.png)\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what might cause this problem? Or is it possible for you to release the frequency response code?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
