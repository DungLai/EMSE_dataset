It's super useful for the work I am doing. So for the speaker identification task, each training sample has the length of 3200 since `fs=16000; cw_len=200; wlen=int(fs*cw_len/1000.00)=3200`. And for testing, voting over even smaller chunks are performed. \r\n\r\nI have a speech classification task that, I think, it's the best to take the whole speech sequence as input without chunking. Currently, is it possible to use variable length input sequence for sincnet at all? If not, then I would pad each batch with zeros to the max length (in each batch). Would sincnet be affected with padded batches? \r\n\r\nOh btw, my speech sequences vary in length by a lot actually. What would be your suggestion Micro? Many thanks again!
