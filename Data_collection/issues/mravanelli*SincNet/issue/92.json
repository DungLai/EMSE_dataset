We then can leverage them on many tasks: identification, verification, diarization, etc. However, at the very sight, Sincnet is not about computing d-vectors. Like, in the speaker_id experiment, it's an end-to-end method to solve the identification problem. All the speakers' features are combined in one model. There's no sub-process of the recipe that involves in computing d-vectors. \r\n\r\nThen, what is the implication of \"compute_d_vectors.py\"? As Mr. Ravanelli explained in the comments, the script will compute d-vectors from test files using the pretrained speaker_id model; each file's name and d-vector will be saved into a dictionary. What are those d-vectors used for, whilst we didn't compute d-vectors for each of the speakers in the training of speaker_id model? We probably don't have anything to compare those test files' d-vectors with.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a silly question. And thanks in advance for any answer.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nVu Nguyen.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
