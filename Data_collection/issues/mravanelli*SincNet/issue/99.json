Now I have converted that model to ONNX and then to tflite for d vector computaion and speaker identification on mobile.\r\n\r\nAs I verified sincnet tflite model in python it worked for me, but now I have to do the same inference on mobile device.\r\n\r\nSo I am trying to convert raw audio into tensor and same numpy computation in c/c++.\r\n\r\nI have not found  any direct way of audio into tensor conversion, as there is no direct implementation of torchaudio for mobile so I am looking to this mfcc computation of audio and then convert into tensor of same dimension.\r\n\r\nI can compute MFCC feature using some c++ library as well as some c++ code. Now I want to know Have you tried to compute d vector (or train model for speaker_id) using MFCC instead of torch tensor(soundfile feature and then to torch tensor)?\r\n\r\nAs I can found you did something like mfcc comparison  as mentioned in below link:\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/328\r\n\r\nSo Can you please confirm:\r\n1. What if I directly compute mfcc feature from audio using some c++ library and then can load sincnet model on mobile for final d vector calculation? Does it affect my d vector values or Does it lead to some major difference in speaker identification final accuracy than using torch tensor?\r\n2. Can you suggest a method to convert raw audio to tensor on mobile device similar to what has been done here?\r\n\r\nI hope my question is clear.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
