Also, I have few questions:\r\n1. I have plotted the \"err_te\" from \"res.res\" file and it seems to be different than Fig. 4 from the paper.  Fig. 4 contains values below 0.4% FER, while the \"res.res\" file has a minimum value for \"err_te\" equal to 0.410. Why?\r\n2. If \"err_te_snt\" represents the classification error, that means the classification error is equal to 0.57% after 360 epochs (according to \"res.res\" file). In the paper it is equal to 0.85% (Table 1). Why?\r\n3. What is the experimental setup for speaker verification?\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
