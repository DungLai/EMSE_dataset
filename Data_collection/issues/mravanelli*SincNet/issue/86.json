I have checked the code in line 52. I have found that  one of the signal's \"snt_len\" in the batchsize  is “2470” ,therefore the value of \"snt_len-wlen-1\" is negtive which causes this error.  I look forward to your answer and thank you very much!\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"speaker_id.py\", line 235, in <module>\r\n    [inp,lab]=create_batches_rnd(batch_size,data_folder,wav_lst_tr,snt_tr,wlen,lab_dict,0.2)\r\n  File \"speaker_id.py\", line 52, in create_batches_rnd\r\n    snt_beg=np.random.randint(snt_len-wlen-1) #randint(0, snt_len-2*wlen-1)##\r\n  File \"mtrand.pyx\", line 745, in numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.randint\r\n  File \"_bounded_integers.pyx\", line 1363, in numpy.random._bounded_integers._rand_int32\r\nValueError: low >= high\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/86/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/86/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
