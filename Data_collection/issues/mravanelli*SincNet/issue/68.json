I use the script named  ‘speaker_id.py ’ to train model, and ‘compute_d_vector.py’ to get embeddings of utterances. In my experiment, I use the cosine similarity to get score,and the performance on speaker identification is good (like your result opening in github ),but on speaker verification I cannot reach my expectations(so far my EER is 3%).So I want to know your EER on TIMIT(verification).
