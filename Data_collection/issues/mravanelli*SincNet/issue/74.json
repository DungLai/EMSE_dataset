I understand, that your filters contain a magnitude less parameters than ordinary CNN layers, and in essence are just DSP inspired frequency filters. \r\n\r\nIn our experience we tried a lot of separable convolutions, and we mostly agree with this [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01067) (i.e. the success of mobile networks shows that the convolutions are overrated, but the mix layer + shift layer can do the job).\r\n\r\nHere STFT is imlemented as a [convolution](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2/blob/master/stft.py\r\n) (they inherit their kernels from numpy, but I guess they are similar in essence to triangual filters from MFCC). So, my questions are:\r\n\r\n- Have you tried using STFT, but actually training the filters?\r\n- Have you tried using separable convolutions?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAlex\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/74/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
