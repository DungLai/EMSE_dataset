Is there a way to track how id's (particular numbers) are assigned in the dictionary? I loaded the file from python command prompt. For example  : 'train/dr5/fjxm0/sx311.wav': 267. How is 267 assigned (maybe there is a reference somewhere in TIMIT dataset)? As i understand the id in such case is: fjxm0.  So, is 267 important? Or, for example (all occurrences of 267 in the file can be changed to some new value).\r\n\r\n2) Can you give some guidelines about how to choose training and test sets for the model? E.g. what percentage for training, and testing?\r\n\r\n3) File: model_raw.pkl. Is the the file for trained model? How can i use this file?\r\n\r\n4) As i understand SincNet solves 'speaker identification task'. What are the differences, compared to speech recognition task? How can i adapt Sincet for individual speaker? (e.g. to compare results for the same speaker spoken twice) Maybe for individual speaker, i need to design test set in a way that only audio files for that speaker is included?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you :)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrius L.","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
