All databases get high accuracy and I'm very pleased.\r\nCurrently I'm trying to apply your code on another task - Musical instruments classification.\r\nI wonder, is it too overkill for let's say 10 instruments? Are the sinc filters still needed?\r\nIn case it sounds right to you, what changes would you recommend?\r\nI would say enlarge window 200ms->500ms, as well as overlap 10ms->50ms. \r\nMaybe also lesser filters (80->20)?\r\nWhat would be the filters' length? Still 251?\r\n\r\nWith much appreciation for your info.\r\nThanks,\r\nCarmi","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
