When we are going to test the model in Speaker Identification, we should divide the test set into two parts, some of the data is used for enrollment and the others is used for test.\r\nFor example, there's ten sentences of each speaker, maybe it's not appropriate to set nine of the sentences for enrollment and one for test, as the model may learn much from the nine sentence and it's easy to make a correct predition of the rest one during test. Thus, in this condition, the accuracy might be higher than it truly should be. But that's not what I want.\r\nI read your code carefully, but didn't find the answer, sorry about that.  :(\r\nSo could you please tell me the way to divide the test set?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
