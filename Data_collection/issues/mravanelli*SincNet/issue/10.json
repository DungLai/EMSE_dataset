How's the d-vector extracted? Which of the following is correct?\r\n\r\n1. The naive way. Namely a random chunk (200 ms, not necessarily comes from the same utterance) of the speaker's audio is pre-processed (`\\x -> x / abs(max(y))`, where `x` is the current chunk and `y` is whole signal), and then fed to the network, the output of the last hidden layer (i.e. the output of `DNN1_net`) is obtained, do the same for other audio chunks (thus many audio chunks are consumed), one would get many vectors, denoted `d_1, d_2, ..., d_n`, each `d_i` is L2 normalized to get `d'_i` and the final d-vector of this speaker is `mean(d'_1, d'_2, ..., d'_n)`.\r\n\r\n2. The \"original\" way. A speaker is represented by a sequence of utterance, `{O_i: i}`, each utterance is consisted of a sequence of frames, `{o_j: j}`, during enrollment/verification, each `o_j` is companied by its context, (the original paper uses 30 frames to the left and 10 frames to the right), and fed to the network, the output of the last hidden layer is extracted, denoted with `a_j`, `a_j` is then L2 normalized, the d-vector of utterance `O_i` is `sum_{j} {a_j}`; the d-vector of the speaker is `mean({d-vector of O_i: i})`\r\n\r\nThe d-vector paper: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41939.pdf\r\n\r\nPS. in both cases, I assume that the network used for extracting d-vector is the same one that is produced by `speaker_id.py`.","closed_by":{"login":"qwfy","id":11158705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU4NzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11158705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy","html_url":"https://github.com/qwfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qwfy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
