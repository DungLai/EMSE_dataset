In the first SincNet\npaper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00158) you can find results for speaker\nrecognition only. In a  follow up study (\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09725.pdf) we also did some speech recognition\nexperiments.  In particular, in Fig. 5 you find the cumulative frequency\nresponse for a phoneme classification with TIMIT (english). Note that in\nthe figure there is a hole in the cumulative frequency response due to the\nnoise added in the bandwidth between  2000 and 2500 Hz. We didn't observe\nmany peaks for speech recognition like for the speaker recognition. We just\nallocate more filters in the lower part of the spectrum. Note also that the\nfilters learned by SincNet might change on different tasks, languages, etc\nand this is in part the strength of this approach.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\nOn Mon, 9 Dec 2019 at 08:31, zehaitu <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi,\n>\n> We are very interested in the frequency response changing phenomenon for\n> phoneme classification when a narrow band noise is added to the wave.\n> However, we could not reproduce the curves in the paper.\n>\n> Here is what we achieved.
