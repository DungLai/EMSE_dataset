As you can see from the config file, the best system on Librispeech is different from that used for TIMIT. In particular, we are using 8kHz speech signals (we use only the bandwidth from 0 to 4 kHz that contains the most important information for speaker-id), we have 3 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers of 2048 neurons, and we are using a larger context of 375 ms. Which dataset are you currently using? In Librispeech we obtained such a very good performance because it is a very clean and noiseless task.

Doing that allows us to write a code a little\nbit more clean when we would like to calculated the d-vectors or when want\nto perform multi-task learning.\n2- With librispeech we used all the speakers, but only taking 10-15 seconds\nof material for each. At the end we are only using about 8/10 hours of\nspeech material. This is more than enough for a simple dataset like\nlibrispeech. Librispeech contains a lot of speakers (more than 2400), but\nit is still a very easy dataset because it is perfectly clean and there\naren't channel mismatch issues. This was a perfect task to initially show\nthe effectiveness of SincNet, but we are now trying our SincNet on more\nrealistic tasks, like VoxCeleb.\n3- For speaker verification the enrollment and test data are taken for both\ndev and test speakers. We sum up all the enrollment d-vectors for each\nspeaker( we thus have 1 enrollment d-vector for each speaker). Then we\ncompare each d-vector computed on each test sentence with the enrollment\nd-vector prototype. This solution turned out to work well for librispeech.\n4. Yes, this totally make sense. There are some frames than are more\nimportant than others to detect the speaker identity. For instance, in the\nrepository we upload a simple d-vector computation code that only sums up\nd-vectors if there is enough energy in the frame. This is a simple solution\nthat allows people to avoid people to compute d-vectors on silence regions.\nOf course you can think about something more complex. One idea is to use an\nRNN, while another (sometimes explored in some speaker-id papers) consists\nin using an attention model.\n\nLet me know if my answers are clear enough...\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\nOn Fri, 22 Feb 2019 at 08:17, seandickert <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks for the response and posting the Librispeech configs and results.\n> I'm using TIMI + Libri + some calls i've recorded.
