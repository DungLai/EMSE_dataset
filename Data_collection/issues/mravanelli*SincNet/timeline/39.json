@mravanelli ! \r\n\r\nCan I please ask why is chunking normally a good idea? Reading your code, you extract one `cw_len` long chunk from each original input sample. Therefore you are not creating more training data in this case, but kind of treating each small chunk as the representative of the original speech sample. It is kinda counter-intuitive if I may say so (for someone like me who has little experience in speech processing at least).

The\nadvantage is that with a relatively shallow neural network (5 layers only)\nwe can embed a pretty large context.
