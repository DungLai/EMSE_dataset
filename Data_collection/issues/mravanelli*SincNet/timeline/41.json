The integer is a unique identifier for that speaker.\n2- This really depends on the dataset and on the constraints that you have\nin a practical application. To make the task more challenging you should\nselect only few seconds of traning material (in our case we use 10-15\nsecond of training material for each speaker).\n3- Yes, the final model is saved in model_raw.pkl. It contains all the\nlearned parameters of the neural network. You can load it using the\nstandard functions of pytorch for loading the saved model (see pytorch\ntutorial).\n4- In this repository SincNet is used for speaker-identification, but it is\nreally a general paradigm for processing audio sequences. In\nhttps://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi you can find SincNet applied to\nspeech recognition.

Is there a way to track how id's (particular\n>    numbers) are assigned in the dictionary? I loaded the file from python\n>    command prompt. For example : 'train/dr5/fjxm0/sx311.wav': 267. How is 267\n>    assigned (maybe there is a reference somewhere in TIMIT dataset)? As i\n>    understand the id in such case is: fjxm0. So, is 267 important? Or, for\n>    example (all occurrences of 267 in the file can be changed to some new\n>    value).\n>    2.\n>\n>    Can you give some guidelines about how to choose training and test\n>    sets for the model? E.g. what percentage for training, and testing?\n>    3.\n>\n>    File: model_raw.pkl. Is the the file for trained model? How can i use\n>    this file?\n>    4.\n>\n>    As i understand SincNet solves 'speaker identification task'. What are\n>    the differences, compared to speech recognition task? How can i adapt\n>    Sincet for individual speaker?

And test data contains (in TIMIT example) more than ~1300 examples.\r\n\r\nIn my case i have 20 speakers (more that 100 records): 10 healthy people and other 10 sick people (have minor problems with their voice). So i should put all audio files of sick people to test data? \r\n\r\nMaybe another way to ask would be like this: suppose i have a trained SincNet model (for example i take 19 persons and divide audio to train and test data accordingly). \r\n\r\nThen i want to make predictions of error metrics to new data samples (lets say for the 20-th person). Is Sincnet capable of doing that? Or this scenario is a \"out of scope\"?\r\n\r\nMaybe there are some Sincnet comands that can  process audio sequence (e.g. on new data audio sample that is not present in train and test sets) using already trained model?  \r\n\r\nMy goal here is to try evaluate the same speaker (e.g. spoke defined sentence once (got and error metric e.g. err_te_snt_1), spoke the same sentence once more and got error metric err_te_snt_2).\r\n\r\nSorry for confusing questions :)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrius
