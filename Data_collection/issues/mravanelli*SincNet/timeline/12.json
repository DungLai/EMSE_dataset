The integers (that range between 0 and\nN_speakers-1) are the labels of our speaker-identification system and tell\nus which is the speaker that is speaking in each utterance. The\nconstruction of this dictionary depends on how the dataset is organized and\nwhere the speaker-id information is stored. For TIMIT is very easy. If you\nconsider a certain file (e.g., TIMIT/train/dr3/fcmg0/sx72.wav, the folder\n\"fcmg0\" is the speaker. You only have to associate \"fcmg0\" to a unique\ninteger (from 0 to N_speakers-1), which is different from that used for the\nother speakers.\n\nMirco\n\nOn Fri, 25 Jan 2019 at 03:46, eeric
