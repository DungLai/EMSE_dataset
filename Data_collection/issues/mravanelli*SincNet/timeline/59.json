After the submission we noticed that this has  a\nminimal impact only on the computation time, mainly because GPUs\nparallelize very efficiently these computations. It can have more impact on\nsmall footprint devices. The paper should be changed to give less emphasis\nto this aspect.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\n\n\nOn Fri, 9 Aug 2019 at 07:21, KnurpsBram <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> The paper mentions symmetry of the convolutional filters as a benefit\n> because 'we can perform convolution in a very efficient way by only\n> considering one side of the filter and inheriting the results for the other\n> half'.
