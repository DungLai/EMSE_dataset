SincNet can tune its filters according to the training\nconditions and if such conditions are very different from test ones you can\nsee overfitting. A good property, however, is it possible to adapt SincNet\nvery quickly to the new domain if you have adaptation data (this is due to\nthe drastically reduced number of parameters). Unfortunately, this is not\npossible with VoxCeleb. To make a SincNet system working on this dataset, a\nlot of efforts should be devoted to avoid overfitting. In our case, we have\nachieved good performance by coupling SincNet with a semi-supervised\nstrategy that acts as a powerful regularizer (see\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00271). We are also working on other ideas to\nhelp SincNet fighting overfitting.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\nOn Thu, 8 Aug 2019 at 12:35, linjucs <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Mirco,\n>\n> Thanks for sharing this code.
