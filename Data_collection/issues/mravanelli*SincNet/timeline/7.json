I haven't  observed such weird filter shapes in my TIMIT experiments. \r\nA possible explanation  is that for same filters the end_frequency ends up to be higher than the Nyquist frequency.  Take a look into the following lines of code:\r\n```python\r\nfilt_beg_freq=torch.abs(self.filt_b1)+min_freq/self.freq_scale\r\nfilt_end_freq=filt_beg_freq+(torch.abs(self.filt_band)+min_band/self.freq_scale)\r\n```\r\nThe filt_end_freq can be in principle any possible value, even higher that 0.5 (that is the normalized Nyquist frequnecy). If that happens the filter can take some kind of weird shape. If the current release code I didn't add any threshold for that since in my case I haven't seen filters exceeding the Nyquist freq. If this happens rarely, I don't think it might hurt the performance. It could be anyway good to add a clip into the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/429441937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/433412927","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/7#issuecomment-433412927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/7","id":433412927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzQxMjkyNw==","user":{"login":"btlorch","id":11959715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTU5NzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11959715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch","html_url":"https://github.com/btlorch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btlorch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T13:45:59Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T13:45:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks Mirco, I'll give this a try should I have to retrain the network at some point.
