We didn't check so far cross-dataset performance. I think the behavior is similar to that of standard neural networks: if the datasets A and B are similar you might have good performance, otherwise, you likely have a performance drop. We are currently working on some adaptation strategies (that will probably be an object of a future paper) in order to perform a quick unsupervised adaptation of SincNet to conditions very different from that seen during training. The big advantage of SincNet if that the first convolutional layers is based on a few hundreds of learnable parameters only, while standard CNNs are based on thousands of them. This feature could make adaptation much easier!
