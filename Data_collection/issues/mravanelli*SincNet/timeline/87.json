For the SpeechBrain project (\nhttps://speechbrain.github.io/) and for the PASE one (\nhttps://github.com/santi-pdp/pase) we didn't perform signal chunking\ndirectly. We just use convolution with stride factors to simulate the\nsliding windows. In practice, to have a feature vector every 10 ms (160\nsamples), we use stride factors like e.g, 2 x 2 x 2x 4 x 5 over the various\nconvolutional layers that follow the sinc_conv one. This gives the same\nperformance using a simpler pipeline.\n\n\nOn Tue, 5 May 2020 at 05:18, Joseph <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Btw, as a side note, I found that for more difficult tasks(in my case I'm\n> classifying the output of a mixed speech separator), SincNet is better\n> trained when given, instead of with one random splice per example per\n> iteration, non-overlapping splices that cover the whole signal.
