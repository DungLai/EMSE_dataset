As you can see from the res.res\" file, when the network converges (see epochs 288-360) there are still some oscillations ranging from (1.4% to 0.57%). To have more \"stable\" and reliable results, in the paper we run our system many times (e.g, 10 times) and we averaged the performance at epoch 360. If you do something like that you should see a number close to what we reported in the paper.

First, we consider the d-vector framework [13, 21], which relies on the output of the last hidden layer and computes the cosine distance between test and the claimed speaker d-vectors. As an alternative solution (denoted in the following as DNN-class), the speaker verification system can directly take the softmax posterior score corresponding to the claimed identity. The two approaches will be compared in Sec. 5.\r\nTen utterances from impostors were randomly selected for each sentence coming from a genuine speaker. Note that to assess our approach on a standard open-set speaker-id task, all the impostors were taken from a speaker pool different from that used for training the speaker-id DNN\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/421361243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1858977391,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg1ODk3NzM5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/events/1858977391","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-20T23:16:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
