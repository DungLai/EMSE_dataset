In general, using low batch sizes is quite helpful for\nthe system performance, due to a regularization effect that arises from\n\"noisy\" gradients. In your case you can try to do the following:\n- increase the batch_size\n- increase the network size\n- increase the dropout rate (the have more regularization)\nThis isn't a gold recipe, but at least is something one can try!\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 25, 2018 at 4:12 AM Wenkai.Zhang <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> my data is very very big, Utilization rate of the gpu(24G) is very low\n> when trainning, 128 batch size used 1G of 24G, I try to add batch size to\n> improve the utilization rate, But I worry about the impact on convergence,\n> do you have some way which can improve the utilization rate of gpu?

I think you should play better\nwith the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, filters,..) and find\nconfiguration that works better for your task.\n\nOn Sep 26, 2018 10:54, \"Wenkai.Zhang\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Excuse me， I have another question，have you tried to use thousands of\n> classes（speakers）to training SincNet？I have tried 4000 classification，but\n> the test_err is so high （about 0.5）。the number of classes is about 420 in\n> your training set and test_err is very low。do you have some gold recipes\n> for thousands of classes to training？If two many classes will cause adverse\n> effect to feature extraction（d -vector），thank you！\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/6#issuecomment-424745298>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AQGs1jr_caVOgk2R9dtcrC56LAdiWBa7ks5ue5UFgaJpZM4W4FdQ>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/424874677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1901558498,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkwMTU1ODQ5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/events/1901558498","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-12T19:46:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
