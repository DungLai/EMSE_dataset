","body":"Hi,\nthank you very much for giving me the possibility to clarify this aspect\n(even from the current version of the paper is not 100% clear and I have to\nclarify it better into the possible camera-ready version on my work).\nOur approach is unsupervised because we don't actually use any speaker-id\nlabel. We only rely on the following (more than reasonable assumptions)\nthat often arises in practice:\n\n1- If I randomly sample two chunks from the same speech signal, these\nsamples belong to the same speakers (i.e., the is only one speaker in each\nspeech signal). This assumption naturally holds for most of the speech\ndataset we have (e.g, librispeech, TIMIT, ...). This naturally holds also\nin practice in many application. Think for instance to devices like Google\nhome, Amazon Alexa where a certain interaction normally involves a single\nspeaker at a time.  The assumption could not hold if you have in input very\nlong audio sequences where multiple speakers are speaking (e.g, a recording\nof a newcast). We didn't address the latter situation in the current paper,\nbut if you constrain the system to take two random chunks that are\nreasonably close you likely sample from the same speakers and you can still\nlearn something useful.\n\n2- If we sample two random chunks from random utterances, they likely\nbelong to different speakers. This is another assumption that arises in\npractice if you have a dataset large enough. Even with a small dataset like\nTIMIT (462 speakers), you have 0.997% of the probability to sample from\ndifferent speakers. In the paper, we can thus have some samples composed of\nthe same speaker, but these are very very rare that they do not harm the\nperformance at all.\n\nHope my answers are clear enough to clarify this aspect of my work. Please,\nlet me know if you have other questions or comments!\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\n\nOn Thu, 24 Jan 2019 at 01:46, c810armyHuan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi @mravanelli <https://github.com/mravanelli>\n>\n> In the comment #11 (comment)\n> <https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/11#issuecomment-447008806>\n>\n> (z_1,z_2) contains speech representations from the same speaker (i.e., is\n> a sample from the joint distribution), while (z_1,z_rnd) contains two\n> speech representations from different speakers\n>\n> While in the paper it says\n>\n> the positive samples (z_1, z_2) are simply derived by randomly sampling\n> speech chunks from the same sentence.\n>\n> In the stage of *unsupervised learning*, are the speaker ids of the\n> utterances used to make sure all utterances in a batch are from different\n> speakers?
