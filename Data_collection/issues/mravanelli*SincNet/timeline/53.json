Actually, in our librispeech/TMITI\nexperiments we only used 10-15 seconds of training material for each\nspeaker and the rest of the material for test.  These datasets are rather\neasy for speaker-id and it is normal to have high accuracy even with few\nseconds of speech for each speaker. If you want to try your technique on a\nmore realistic dataset, I would suggest using VoxCeleb, where you already\nfind the standard splits to use.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\n\n\nOn Fri, 12 Jul 2019 at 05:02, Range <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hello!\n> Firstly, thanks for sharing the code of your paper, it's really a\n> fantastic work!\n> But I'm quite confused when I'm going to test my own model.

So I select 8 speakers for training and 2 speakers for test. After training, the 2 speakers are unknown for our model while the 8 speakers used for training is known for it. Just aim at the 2 speakers in the test. You know, in speaker identification, there's a process named enrollment (or maybe annotation, :)  ). We usually select some sentences for enrollment(or annotation.), and the rest for testing whether the model could give a right prediction. So the things I want to know is that, when I'm going to test my model with the 20(10x2=20) sentences of the 2 speakers, **How to divide the 20 sentences into two parts?**\r\nThe result will be better if I select 9 sentences for enrollment and 1 for test than setting 5 for enrollment and 5 for test, because the model could learn more about the speaker from 9 sentences than 5.
