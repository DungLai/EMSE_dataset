In practice, we take a decision based on windows of 200 ms\nshifted by 10 ms and we average the posterior probabilities over all these\nframes composing the sentence. The class with the highest average\nprobability is the winner and it is compared with the reference ground\ntruth. This procedure is repeated for all the sentences of the test set.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\n\nOn Tue, 6 Aug 2019 at 09:18, Sathiyakugan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Since the paper indicates that Sentence error rate could you please\n> explain about the Sentence error rate on Speaker Identification ?\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/57?email_source=notifications&email_token=AEA2ZVRTXS7DPOTBNBQE3EDQDF22NA5CNFSM4IJWIRH2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HDUF5CA>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEA2ZVSYL5MTMMDZ4DGBG3TQDF22NANCNFSM4IJWIRHQ>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/518699740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2563353730,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU2MzM1MzczMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/events/2563353730","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-16T20:30:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
