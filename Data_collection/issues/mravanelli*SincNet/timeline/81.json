Actually, in the config file we use \"\ncnn_use_laynorm_inp=True\" that normalizes every time the dynamic and make\nrand_amp useless.\nWithout layer norm set to \"true\",  you might have signals with amplitude\n>1. This is not real clipping (we are not saving the signal), but it could\nbe something that one wants to avoid.\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\nOn Wed, 18 Dec 2019 at 10:21, carmi shimon <notifications@github.com>
