I would start from point 3 and see\nif the recognition accuracy is still acceptable. Regarding how to\nimplement, you have to change the \"class_lay\" to 550. Then, you have to\nfreeze all the other networks (i.e., you don't have to compute any updates\nfor their parameters). This can be simply done by adding a comment in the\nfollowing line of the speaker_id.py script:\n#optimizer_CNN.step() #optimizer_DNN1.step()\n\n\n<https://www.avast.com/sig-email?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\nVirus-free.\nwww.avast.com\n<https://www.avast.com/sig-email?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\n<#DAB4FAD8-2DD7-40BB-A1B8-4E2AA1F9FDF2>\n\nOn Thu, 18 Apr 2019 at 09:07, Bogdan Nechita <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hello,\n>\n> First of all, thanks for all the great work :)\n>\n> I managed to reproduce the results from the paper using the TIMIT dataset\n> and I am now thinking about the following scenario:\n>\n> I have a dataset of 500 speakers, I trained the model on it, I get a good\n> enough accuracy and the model can reliably identify one of those 500\n> speakers from an audio sample.

Mirco,\r\nI have a task where I need to take a pre-trained SincNet and re-train it on our data. Both datasets are prepared according to your protocols. SincNet trained on first dataset is available as well. Now, I want to remove the output layer of trained network and use a new output corresponding to new speakers from Dataset 2. What scripts I need to modify to do it. Do you think such a strategy is good rather than combining both datasets and re-train on composite dataset. In real-world, we get more data after every few month and re-training could be time consuming. So, I want to test this strategy to initialized from a previously trained network hoping that is could converge faster.

of all, thanks for sharing your work :) \r\nI am new in speech recognition science field.\r\n\r\nWanted to ask couple of questions:\r\n\r\n1) TIMIT_labels.npy. Is there a way to track how id's (particular numbers) are assigned in the dictionary? I loaded the file from python command prompt. For example  : 'train/dr5/fjxm0/sx311.wav': 267. How is 267 assigned (maybe there is a reference somewhere in TIMIT dataset)? As i understand the id in such case is: fjxm0.  So, is 267 important? Or, for example (all occurrences of 267 in the file can be changed to some new value).\r\n\r\n2) Can you give some guidelines about how to choose training and test sets for the model? E.g. what percentage for training, and testing?\r\n\r\n3) File: model_raw.pkl. Is the the file for trained model? How can i use this file?\r\n\r\n4) As i understand SincNet solves 'speaker identification task'. What are the differences, compared to speech recognition task? How can i adapt Sincet for individual speaker? (e.g. to compare results for the same speaker spoken twice) Maybe for individual speaker, i need to design test set in a way that only audio files for that speaker is included?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you :)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrius L.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/501872723","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/37#issuecomment-501872723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/37","id":501872723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTg3MjcyMw==","user":{"login":"singhaki","id":18519731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki","html_url":"https://github.com/singhaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-13T20:47:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T20:47:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Mirco,\r\nI was successfully able to run the finetune process by adding a new speaker. but the finetune network wants to see whole data at the time of finetuning, why? as I have freezed the layers for other speakers then the finetune process should only see new speaker data and learn to identify it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/501872723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"singhaki","id":18519731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki","html_url":"https://github.com/singhaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/502091020","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/37#issuecomment-502091020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/37","id":502091020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjA5MTAyMA==","user":{"login":"singhaki","id":18519731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki","html_url":"https://github.com/singhaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T12:31:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T12:31:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"for running the finetune script i have made following changes.\r\n1. in config file increased class by adding number of new users.
