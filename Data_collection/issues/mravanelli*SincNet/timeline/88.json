In practice, after the submission we did a code\nrefactoring and for some reason that I have to investigate better (probably\ndue to filter amplitude normalization) the gradient is smaller than before\nand the filters are more static than those of the original version. I will\nwork on that to find exactly the modification that caused that. For now, I\nthink you can add a separate optimizer for the sincnet layer and use higher\nlearning rate for it. This will encourage the filters to change more and\neventually reach some configuration like the one shown in the\noriginal paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 5 May 2020 at 17:09, Dao Anh Tuan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Marco,\n>\n> Thanks for sharing your great work!\n>\n> I am trying to replicate the cumulative response of the SincNet filter\n> like the figure 3 in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00158.pdf).\n>\n> I load your pre-trained model and computed the Fourier transforms of all\n> the learned filters like figure below.\n> [image: ask_Figure_2]\n> <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35039289/81115154-8e2a8500-8f23-11ea-95f7-fcafd0132250.png>\n>\n> Then I averaged the sum of all frequency response of the learned filters\n> to get the cumulative response of the SincNet filter like figure below\n> [image: ask_Figure_1]\n> <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35039289/81115740-7bfd1680-8f24-11ea-9609-a14d72807d78.png>\n>\n> What is your opinion about this problem?\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/88>, or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEA2ZVQ5MABWBELVN474KPLRQB6CPANCNFSM4MZ5GL3Q>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/624311234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/624314918","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/88#issuecomment-624314918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/88","id":624314918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDMxNDkxOA==","user":{"login":"tuananh0305","id":35039289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDM5Mjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35039289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305","html_url":"https://github.com/tuananh0305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuananh0305/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-05T21:25:24Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T21:25:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Marco,\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick response!\r\n\r\nI will try your suggestion.
