I'm not sure\nthat it makes sense to have many consecutive layers of SincConv. After the\nfirst layer we might loose a bit the sense of what we are doing and my\nfeeling is that two parameters are not enough. Feel free to share the\nresults if you achieve something interesting with it!\n\nBest,\n\nMirco\n\nOn Wed, 20 Nov 2019 at 04:40, Shing Chan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks for the nice work.
