The difference is that layer nom normalises all of the features of an example at once (by computing means and std over the neurons), instance norm normalizes features within each channel. Yes, in this case we perform a per-channel layer normalization, aka instance normalization. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this aspect!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/423376379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/423437855","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/5#issuecomment-423437855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/5","id":423437855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzQzNzg1NQ==","user":{"login":"hbredin","id":1080837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin","html_url":"https://github.com/hbredin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbredin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T07:15:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T07:15:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.
