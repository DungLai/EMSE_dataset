As you have pointed out in SincNet we are not using STFT, but we are doing something related to it. In fact, you can see SincNet as a way to learn the STFT itself, where instead of using \"fixed fft points\" we use learnable channels. If you reorder the channels according to the central frequency you obtain a representation similar to the STFT (not that in SincNet we are not taking the magnitude of the STFT, but we have the full representation that includes the phase contribution).  You can for sure learn some filters on the top of the STFT (as done in some papers cited in my work), but in SincNet we decided to avoid the step of pre-computing the STFT and starts from the lowest possible representation (i.e, the simple waveform).  We didn't tried separable convolutions, but could be worth trying.

days I worked a bit on something related to that. I have modified the\nfilter-bank implementation that you find within torch.audio to make the\ncentral frequency and the band of the filters learnable.

Now we are just using this STFT [implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2/blob/master/stft.py) (it works on CPU faster than librosa for some reason, also to make it easier for our models to work with TTS voices, because you could just train Tacotron to output STFT and omit the vocoder for now =) ) with these params:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> @attr.s(kw_only=True)\r\n> class AudioConfig(object):\r\n>     window_size = attr.ib(default=0.02)\r\n>     window_stride = attr.ib(default=0.01)\r\n>     sample_rate = attr.ib(default=16000)\r\n>     ....\r\n> \r\n> self.n_fft = int(audio_config.sample_rate * (audio_config.window_size + 1e-8))\r\n> self.hop_length = int(audio_config.sample_rate * (audio_config.window_stride + 1e-8))\r\n> \r\n> self.stft = STFT(self.n_fft,  #

in asteroid](https://github.com/mpariente/AsSteroid/blob/master/asteroid/filterbanks/stft_fb.py) is roughly equivalent. Few points where it's different :\r\n- The forward and backward basis are the same (this saves a little bit of space).\r\n- The output of the encoding is the concatenation of the real and imaginary parts instead of the magnitude and the phase. That's just a choice and these are equivalent.\r\n- The main difference is the following : I never divide by the window's envelope. I should do some proper experiments on that and write it somewhere because dividing by the window's envelope is done everywhere. Even if it enables unit-test level perfect reconstruction, in my experience, it hurts performance for speech enhancement and source separation applications by introducing amplitude modulation artifacts to the resynthesis. \r\n- `np.sqrt(hanning)` is used by default, it has better reconstruction that `hanning` (if we don't divide by the window's envelope).\r\n- I truncate the STFT filters instead of padding them so that I don't convolve with a lot of zeros in case of over-complete STFT (it should be a bit faster).\r\n\r\nOverall, it is very similar.\r\n\r\n> If I did not miss anything in your code, even if I use `STFTFB`, it will [be](https://github.com/mpariente/AsSteroid/blob/master/asteroid/filterbanks/stft_fb.py#L52) trainable?\r\n> So to do a proper ablation test, I need to freeze it separately, right?\r\n\r\nIt is not trainable, `register_buffer` is used, not `register_parameter`. A `buffer` is just an object which will be saved in the state_dict and be transferred to CPU or GPU along with the model but it doesn't appear in `model.parameters()` and is not updated by the optimzer.\r\n\r\n> @mpariente\r\n> \r\n> Many thanks for your code and paper.\r\n> I will try to understand the deeper logic behind it.\r\n> \r\n> Meanwhile a couple of basic dumb questions to do some quick and dirty experiments.\r\n> \r\n> > but I should write how to use it somewhere, sorry.\r\n> \r\n> Or I guess I can also use this constructor you provided [here](https://github.com/mpariente/AsSteroid/blob/master/asteroid/filterbanks/__init__.py#L12), right?\r\n> Also, I just pass params like `n_filters` / `kernel_size` / `stride` as kwargs, right?\r\n> \r\n\r\nYes exactly, `make_enc_dec` will provide an encoder and a decoder. To be equivalent to your piece of code, you can use: \r\n``` \r\nself.stft = make_enc_dec('stft', n_filters=self.n_fft,\r\n                         kernel_size=self.n_fft,\r\n                         stride=self.hop_length)[0]\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis will produce 322 features (the output shape is in `self.stft.n_feats_out`) and you can use [this](https://github.com/mpariente/AsSteroid/blob/master/asteroid/filterbanks/inputs_and_masks.py#L39) to take the magnitude or `self.stft.post_process_inputs` if you specified `inp_mode='mag'` in the encoder. And it will produce the same 161-dim features.\r\n\r\n> Also maybe could you provide some guidance on the default params I should start with for each filter-bank given our params above? \r\n\r\nYou can use exactly the same parameters for all filterbanks and it makes sense, that's the nice thing about it. So you can have a fair comparison between these filterbanks.\r\n\r\n> > This is because the stride is very small, I can suggest using analytic filterbanks (from which shift invariant representation can be computed) with larger stride to solve this problem.\r\n> \r\n> Are you referring to the stride used in SincNet by default? \r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n> > Have you tried using STFT, but actually training the filters?\r\n> > This is exactly what the FreeFB and AnalyticFreeFB are doing in the code I linked to.\r\n> \r\n> Judging from the code, FreeFB is just Conv1D and STFTFB is just Conv1D initialized with STFT.\r\n> But what is AnalyticFreeFB?\r\n\r\n`FreeFB` will be the regular Conv1D without bias, that's right. \r\nThe `STFTFB` is also a Conv1D but the filters are the one from the STFT (they are fixed, not learnable)\r\n`AnalyticFreeFB` is a learned analytic filterbank.

rough and dirty memory and compute comparison of the filter-banks available in your repo?\r\n\r\nRegarding the table, if the same values are used for `n_filters`, `kernel_size` and `stride`, the

[The paper I linked to](https://128.84.21.199/abs/1910.10400) shows that modern DNN can benefit from using the complex representation (depending on the size of the window) because the modelling capabilities are higher now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/557808691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mpariente","id":18496796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDk2Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18496796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente","html_url":"https://github.com/mpariente","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpariente/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/comments/557811324","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/74#issuecomment-557811324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mravanelli/SincNet/issues/74","id":557811324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzgxMTMyNA==","user":{"login":"snakers4","id":12515440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTE1NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12515440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4","html_url":"https://github.com/snakers4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snakers4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T16:19:46Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T16:19:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Many thanks for your explanations. \r\n\r\nAfter we complete the current batch of experiments, I guess will add the following experiments to the queue:\r\n\r\n- (2 more long experiments now in the queue)\r\n- (current baseline) nvidia stft (CPU)\r\n- (new) STFTFB fixed (CPU or GPU)\r\n- (new) STFTFB learnable (GPU)\r\n- (new) FreeFB learnable (GPU)\r\n- (new) AnalyticFreeFB learnable (GPU),\r\n- (new) ParamSincFB learnable (GPU)\r\n- Also for the best option I will try to fiddle with the number of channels - what if, for example, with SincNet we could afford 5x filters (161 * 4-5 also looks kind of similar to the networks' hidden size)?\r\n\r\nEach experiment is best when you run it at least for ~24 hours, so it will take between 1 and 2 weeks to test all this.
