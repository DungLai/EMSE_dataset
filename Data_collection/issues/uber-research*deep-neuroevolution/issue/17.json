I am trying to apply the idea of using GAs to train models for some of my own work and have been looking to your work and code for some inspiration. I am wondering if you could help me find out how the weight calculated by the GA are fed into the tensorflow model archictecture? I have been looking through the repo for a while but am struggling to find the link between the GA and the model run.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"fps7806","id":7218057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTgwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7218057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806","html_url":"https://github.com/fps7806","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fps7806/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber-research/deep-neuroevolution/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uber-research/deep-neuroevolution/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
