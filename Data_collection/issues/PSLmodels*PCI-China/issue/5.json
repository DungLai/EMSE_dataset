Consider mentioning the fact that the user needs a CUDA-enabled GPU to create the environment and run PCI. I found a list of compatible GPU's [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).\r\n2. To install the `jieba-fast` package, I first had to install [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019). If this is necessary, it might be helpful to ask users to install these tools.\r\n3. To get the tests to pass, I had to separately pip install `MonthDelta`. I see that `MonthDelta` is included in your `environment.yml`, so I'm not sure why it didn't install correctly the first time.\r\n4. The tests have to be run from the `PCI-China/PCI-China` directory.\r\n\r\ncc: @ctszkin @towashington ","closed_by":{"login":"Peter-Metz","id":43755005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzU1MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43755005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz","html_url":"https://github.com/Peter-Metz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peter-Metz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PSLmodels/PCI-China/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PSLmodels/PCI-China/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
