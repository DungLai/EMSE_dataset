To solve the problem, @rbinrais implemented https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/pull/301 which enables delegating authentication to a proxy server that provides the user information to doccano via headers. Perhaps you can use a similar approach for the anonymous log-in use-case, especially if the auth proxy server feature gets combined with RBAC as implemented in https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/pull/333, e.g. you could set headers in the proxy server that gives all users annotator level access.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/520962043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"c-w","id":1086421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w","html_url":"https://github.com/c-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2554380285,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU1NDM4MDI4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2554380285","actor":{"login":"rbinrais","id":13594864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13594864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais","html_url":"https://github.com/rbinrais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T18:52:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2554380288,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NTQzODAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2554380288","actor":{"login":"rbinrais","id":13594864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13594864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais","html_url":"https://github.com/rbinrais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbinrais/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T18:52:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/541324677","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/183#issuecomment-541324677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/183","id":541324677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTMyNDY3Nw==","user":{"login":"vwoloszyn","id":3843367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDMzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3843367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn","html_url":"https://github.com/vwoloszyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vwoloszyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T13:23:24Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T13:24:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've
