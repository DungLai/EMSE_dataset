figured out a solution for this. First you need to convert your ConLL format into a list of lists format, such as:\r\n\r\n`sentences[0:2]`\r\noutput:\r\n```\r\n[['EU', 'rejects', 'German', 'call', 'to', 'boycott', 'British', 'lamb', '.'],\r\n ['Peter', 'Blackburn']]\r\n```\r\n`labels[0:2]`\r\noutput:\r\n```\r\n[['B-ORG', 'O', 'B-MISC', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'B-MISC', 'O', 'O'],\r\n ['B-PER', 'I-PER']]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen with the code below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n# exploding the list of lists into a flat list and then determining what are the unique values py using pandas\r\nunique_labels = pd.Series(list(chain.from_iterable(labels))).unique()\r\nunique_labels = list(unique_labels)\r\n# we need to remove the \"O\" label\r\nunique_labels.remove(\"O\")\r\n\r\n# create an empty list to create a list of dictionaries\r\nlist_json = []\r\n\r\nfor x, i in enumerate(sentences):\r\n    list_json.append({\"id\": x}) # create id key for sentence\r\n    list_json[x][\"text\"] = \" \".join(i) # create the text key for the sentence\r\n    list_json[x][\"labels\"] = [] # create an empty label key to later append\r\n    for y, j in enumerate(labels[x]):\r\n        if j in unique_labels:\r\n            word = i[y] # determine what the word is\r\n            # \r\n            # If I don't add an if statement here, the label indexes for the first always got tagged 1 index to the right\r\n            # I am not sure why but this if statement fixes the problem\r\n            #\r\n            if y == 0: \r\n                #

I looked around 200 sentences and detected no problems so far. Although I also did try uploading my poorly trained model outputs to cut back on time required to label, but found that if the ConLL format is wrong this code works poorly. For instance if you have a label starting with B, and then no labels(\"O\") for 3 words, and then a random label starting with \"I\", 5 labels become tagged as one, since the \"I\" label originally had no \"B\" tag associated with it.\r\n\r\n@icoxfog417 @Hironsan If you think this is helpful, feel free to use this on your platform. You can change and modify whatever you want. You can probably make this a lot more efficient. I have only recently started programming so I have zero clue about code efficiency. But this method works and that's really what matters for me. Also if there is a problem with the code, let me know so I can fix wherever there is a mistake.\r\n\r\nNote: I originaly tried this with private data where I had 12 total labels. It works the same with however many labels you may have.\r\n\r\nIf anyone needs the code to transform ConLL 2003 format to a list of lists which I used above, feel free to @ me. I can also share that if anyone needs it. But you can find it online very
