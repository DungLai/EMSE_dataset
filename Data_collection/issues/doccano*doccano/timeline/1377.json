default max_length for FileField is 100 characters and I think this is very limiting if we consider during the upload a random nested folder will be created.\r\n\r\nThis is an example on where the file actually located in the media folder:\r\n<MEDIA_DIR>/TPBdmbMKMFgXf6e83qXPg2/PmTRJ4PmMngrBo8QmnqmBt/<FILENAME>\r\nThe length of the generated directory is 47 characters, which mean if we upload a file with length more than 53 characters it will cause error.\r\n\r\nNote that generally the maximum length of a filename in UNIX system is 255 and the maximum length of a filepath is 4096 ([source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/32795/what-is-the-maximum-allowed-filename-and-folder-size-with-ecryptfs)). Hence it will be good to relax the constraint of the FileField from 100 characters, in this PR we relax it into 1024 characters.\r\n\r\nI believe this will resolve the issue:
