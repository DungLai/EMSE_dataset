pull request has a simple objective: creating a new annotation mode, for the task \"question and answer\" \r\n\r\nRef: #81 \r\n\r\n**What changed**\r\n\r\n- Backend: 2 models were created (_QandAProject_  & _QandAAnnotation_ ) and all the following related (serializer)\r\nThe model _Document_ was slightly modified, adding the text field called _extra_text_ - allows some tasks to store additional information, like a question for instance.\r\nMigrations were created following the model changes as well\r\nQuestionable: the necessity of having QandAStorage. At the moment, I guess I could use _Seq2seqStorage_ instead.  \r\n\r\n- Frontend: a new front was added using the component _download_qanda.vue_. Visual examples for uploading / downloading data were created as well.\r\n\r\n**Other Info**\r\nThis is a Draft pull request at the moment. No tests were created yet, and it isn't merged with the latest master branch due to a problem with _pyodbc_ on my side","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/304/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T04:02:23Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T04:02:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/464","id":528471416,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Mjg0NzE0MTY=","number":464,"title":"Feature
