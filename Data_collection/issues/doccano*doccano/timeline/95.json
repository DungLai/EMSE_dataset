pull request is based on the work of @tayciryahmed in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/121 and implements speech-to-text transcription in Doccano.\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, the implementation for now uses [html5 audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) instead of something more sophisticated like [wavesurfer](https://wavesurfer-js.org/). This can be improved in the future if the requirement arises. The `alt+p` keyboard shortcut has been introduced to play/pause the audio player.\r\n\r\n![Animation showing speech to text transcription](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/70725650-c6a69980-1cca-11ea-99c9-a0ea967a20eb.gif)\r\n\r\nFor ease-of-use, speech-to-text data can be imported either by posting audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) or by uploading a JSONL manifest that encodes the audio as [data URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) or URLs to the audio files.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to identify and distinguish audio files, the document left-navigation has been updated to display a file name (instead of file content) if the `meta.filename` attribute is set.\r\n\r\nResolves
