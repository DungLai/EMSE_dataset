However I am not able to go very far. Right now atleast it communicates.\r\nWith the following code for annotation -\r\n```py\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\r\nimport uvicorn\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\nimport spacy\r\n\r\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_trf\")\r\n\r\nclass TextToAnnotate(BaseModel):\r\n    text: str\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n@app.post(\"/auto_annotate\")\r\nasync def auto_annotate(document: TextToAnnotate):\r\n    doc = nlp(document.text)\r\n    ent_label_list = []\r\n    for ent in doc.ents:\r\n        ent_label_list.append({ \"label\": ent.label_, \"start_offset\": ent.start_char, \"end_offset\": ent.end_char })\r\n    print(ent_label_list)\r\n    return ent_label_list\r\n\r\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\r\n    uvicorn.run(\"auto_annotate:app\", host='0.0.0.0', port=7000)\r\n```\r\nWhat I am having a hard time understanding is this, in postman I send the sentence to be annotated as json in \"body\". Here, I have added the \"text\" key to the Body but not provided any value because the value keeps on changing based on the input sentence. In the GUI there is a \"Sample Text\" in **Test the Parameters** section, however I just cannot understand what it does because the input text to it does not go to the API via body since I don't get any annotated output.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12681262/122806732-511c8000-d2e8-11eb-8500-e16aa82fc42a.png)\r\nI expected that the Sample Text will be sent via Body. But apparently that is not the case. Also, when I give the value to the Body Key, then I do see the expected output.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12681262/122806925-9476ee80-d2e8-11eb-9e60-b1e44fc59e14.png)\r\n\r\nBut that is not that important. As you can see I have formatted the output in the way Doccano wants as it mentions in the next section. I am thinking that if the output is like what it expects then I don't have to provide any template, right? Moreover, I still don't understand the purpose of the template.....like how exactly am I supposed to use it? Just linking to the whole of Jinja's documentation does not help at all.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12681262/122807290-00f1ed80-d2e9-11eb-90dc-17fb67494ede.png)\r\n\r\nWithout any modifications if I run this, I get a massive error as follows
