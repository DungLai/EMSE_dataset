you for the feature request! We already discussing about it at #6, but it will be good timing to summarize the discussion about auto labeling (because auto-labeling would be one of the most important feature of next version doccano).\r\n\r\n**Why we need auto-labeling?**\r\n\r\ndiscribed at [Feature Idea](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/projects/2#card-16404963)\r\n\r\n* For reducing human labeling cost drastically.\r\n\r\nIf labels are automatically set, only the users have to do is check & edit these.\r\n\r\n**How to make auto-labeling model**\r\n\r\nThere are mainly 2 approaches.\r\n\r\n1. Transfer learning setting\r\n   * Prepare the pre-trained model, and transfer it by annotated data.\r\n2. Semi-supervised setting\r\n   * Train the model by annotated label gradually.\r\n\r\nAnd we can use active learning when selecting annotation target data (more than select randomly).\r\n\r\n|                                            | use trained model? | choose target data? |\r\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\r\n| 1.

Stream processing frameworks like Kafka give the user flexibility to window a certain number of events (like `LabeledSentenceIngressed`) and after the window size has been met, retrain in a minibatch. It also allows you to easily do A/B testing or blue-green deployments of models. This might not be realistic for existing users, though, since kafka is a big dependency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/490862017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"erip","id":2348806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDg4MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2348806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip","html_url":"https://github.com/erip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/494892157","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/191#issuecomment-494892157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/191","id":494892157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDg5MjE1Nw==","user":{"login":"c-w","id":1086421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w","html_url":"https://github.com/c-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T17:15:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T17:15:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Instead

of a solution for auto-labeling (sequence labelling projects only) as discussed in https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/191\r\n\r\n- Solution based on spaCy’s ner module (multi-language)\r\n\r\n- New button that allows an admin to start auto-labeling (and removes unapproved annotations)\r\n\r\n- For now, if a document has no annotation, it will never be described as ‘validated’. I propose  an other way to define a document as ‘validated’ : a document is ‘validated' when it has been approved by an admin. I changed this behaviour because otherwise we couldn’t differentiate documents labeled automatically from others. \r\n\r\n\r\nPossible improvements :\r\n\r\n- Add a shortcut to quickly validate one document (Enter?)\r\n\r\n- Currently, the labels suggested by the algorithm are saved as if they were done by the admin clicking on the button; so a ‘normal’ user can’t change it. It would be better to add these new labels as if they were done by an other user (named ‘computer' for example)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T13:12:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T13:12:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/467","id":528549758,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Mjg1NDk3NTg=","number":467,"title":"Auto-labeling feature.

[`doccano-client`](https://pypi.org/project/doccano-client/) released to PyPI, it is now possible to hand off the active learning part to an external actor (preferably with its own Django user to distinguish model annotations from user annotations), like a Jupyter Notebook on a remote machine (with GPUs). With a powerful machine available, it is not too much overhead to just periodically predict all to-be-annotated docs, instead of predicting the docs on the fly.\r\n\r\nI made a generic PoC of such a set up for Sequence Labelling projects, which takes all checked docs, trains, and predicts all unchecked docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ddelange/35d219991d60606dfff034a3985bb0d1\r\n\r\nThis way, the architecture does not grow as complex as [AlpacaTag](https://github.com/INK-USC/AlpacaTag), and the user keeps full control over hypertuning and model architectures etc.\r\n\r\nPlus, the Doccano server doesn't experience extra load from the training/inference!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/757121781/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ddelange","id":14880945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODgwOTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14880945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange","html_url":"https://github.com/ddelange","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddelange/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4258742904,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQ0MjU4NzQyOTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4258742904","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-28T01:31:04Z","project_card":{"id":53711836,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/53711836","project_id":3566476,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/3566476","column_name":"To

PR allows users to label text automatically. I think this enables users to speed up annotation.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/20776641e232fa8102f82e1f7889d4f2.gif)\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThis feature enables automatic labeling by calling the Web API from doccano. Therefore, you can use any commercial service (e.g. Google Natural Language API, Amazon Comprehend, Watson, etc.) or your own server for labeling, as long as you can call the API from doccano. Notice that there is no learning function for now. This is an issue for the future.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n1. Select \"Settings\" on the side menu.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108456951-e533f780-72b4-11eb-9a5b-cf557bf313d6.png)\r\n\r\n2. Select \"Auto Labeling\" tab and press \"Create\" button.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108457020-08f73d80-72b5-11eb-9579-7ef5ba9e4c52.png)\r\n\r\n3. Select a configuration template. Some tasks have predefined templates to simplify the configuration.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108457067-22988500-72b5-11eb-8620-409d37775120.png)\r\n\r\n4. Enter the parameters required to use the API.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108457117-44920780-72b5-11eb-8590-5440455a5189.png)\r\n\r\n5. Write a mapping template to extract labels from API responses. If you select the predefined template, you can skip this process.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108457186-6f7c5b80-72b5-11eb-84f7-7d1e9089590c.png)\r\n\r\n6. Map the label fetched from the API to a label defined by you.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/108457273-9fc3fa00-72b5-11eb-80da-05986ea4d957.png)\r\n\r\n### Turn on the feature\r\n\r\n1. Go to the annotation page.\r\n2. Select the settings button.\r\n3. Turn on the feature.\r\n\r\nNotice that if you don't have any configuration, you can't use this feature.\r\n\r\n## Future works\r\n\r\n- Assigning a configuration to each user\r\n- Allow the admin to set throttling for each user\r\n- Allow merging of responses from multiple APIs\r\n- Implementing the training feature\r\n- Increase the number of the predefined templates(https://github.com/doccano/auto-labeling-pipeline)\r\n\r\nclose #191
