It is not perfect but it can filter documents by the number of annotated users. We can specify it by `k`.

discussed in https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/249, it is a very useful feature to enable a type of users to review and approve labels that other users annotated. The review feature for example enables workflows like the ones discussed in https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/65 where many users can annotate the dataset and then some trusted users can verify the labels before we use them for downstream workflows such as model building.\r\n\r\nAs such, this pull request implements a simple label review mechanism: admin users now see a button on the annotation page that enables them to approve or reject labels. The approval is shown in the exported datasets so that downstream applications can exclude non-approved labels.\r\n\r\n![Animation showing label approving workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/60116855-e959eb80-9746-11e9-9c4c-8e3418264a34.gif)\r\n\r\nIn the future, this feature can be expanded to for example include multiple reviewers per document or to provide a customized \"label reviewer\" role whose document sort order by default shows labeled but not-reviewed documents first in the annotation view.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/258/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/507433839","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/65#issuecomment-507433839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/65","id":507433839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzQzMzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"hankcs","id":5326890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs","html_url":"https://github.com/hankcs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-01T21:32:51Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T21:32:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> A simple solution is dynamic filtering. It is not perfect but it can filter documents by the number of annotated users. We can specify it by `k`. The endpoint is like http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/projects/1/docs?k=3.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> from django_filters.rest_framework import FilterSet, NumberFilter\r\n> from django.db.models import Count\r\n> from .models import Document\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> class DocumentFilter(FilterSet):\r\n> \r\n>     def get_k(self, queryset, name, value):\r\n>         docs = queryset.annotate(num=Count('seq_annotations__user', distinct=True))\r\n>         return docs.filter(num__lt=value)\r\n> \r\n>     k = NumberFilter(method='get_k')\r\n> \r\n>     class Meta:\r\n>         model = Document\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Once we set `k` in a project, we can use it when fetching documents in an annotation page. Annotators don't have to care about k. All things are performed in the background.\r\n> \r\n> From a viewpoint of implementation, I think it does not require a lot of changes: add DocumentFilter's condition, add a column for `k` to Project model and change frontend(`search` method in annotation page).\r\n\r\nSome documents will get annotated for more than k times, since there is no synchronization in the UI. Users click next, the data in this page remains the same as the first time this pages fetch from the server. So, the next document might be annotated by other users too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/507433839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hankcs","id":5326890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs","html_url":"https://github.com/hankcs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hankcs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
