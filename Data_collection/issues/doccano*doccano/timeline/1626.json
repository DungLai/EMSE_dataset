Our use case for it is an image caption project, and we would like to use doccano in the evaluation stage, when human annotators assess the quality of the model generated captions when paired with an image.\r\nIt should be something similar to a star classification (rating scale) for each of the sentences:\r\n![2880px-FiveStarsInline3 svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87035270/151740081-03d4e5ff-98e7-4ce5-a33b-6e3e1005b083.png)\r\n\r\nand also an option to add new text if needed - if the annotator thinks none of the suggested sentences describe the image well enough, they can add their caption for the image.\r\n\r\nWe have a couple of questions:\r\n1. Are you willing to add this feature to doccano?\r\n2. We are willing to contribute this as a PR. Do you think you could roll it out quickly once the PR is ready, as a new release or a mid-term release?\r\n3. Would you be reviewing the code or someone else? if it’s someone else, how can we reach out to them?\r\n4. How long do you think this whole process will take?\r\n5. Will you be willing to hop on a call about this feature? it may be easier to share our thoughts about it over a call.\r\n\r\nIn general, we thought to add a new Project type for rating image captions. In this new project type we’ll enable importing of dataset with images and a list of sentences for each image. Each sentence will have a star rating scale next to it - where annotators will have to choose one of 5 possible labels: 1/2/3/4/5 stars. In addition, there will be an option to add a new sentence.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to hear your
