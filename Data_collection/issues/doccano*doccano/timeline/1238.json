Not updating since 1.1.0 (26 January 2021).**\r\n\r\nGood day!\r\n\r\nThank you for your GREAT work!\r\n\r\nI have some enhancement requests... Just for a note, maybe. I will update them permanently.\r\n\r\n1. ~URLs should become to a corresponding state. On Dataset page, URL is `/projects/4/dataset`. But refreshing the page redirects to `/projects/4` (#595; implemented in #897; see also #992, 976).~\r\n2. ~Pagination, \"rows per page\" should change URL (#595; also mentioned in #540, #578; implemented in #897). And moreover: every view state should have its own URL.~\r\n3. Put label hints and key shortcut hints back to Annotation page (#635 (merged in non-equivalent #834); mentioned in #509, #627, #776, #991, #1035; see also #829, #834).\r\n4. Show number of imported rows (#1078).\r\n5. Show number of deleting rows only in confirm dialog.

(#523, #631; implemented in #1115)\r\n10. ~Add importing of Excel and CoNLL files to UI (#650; implemented in #872; mentioned in #847).~\r\n11. Use API error's messages in UI instead of common error messages (#601 (merged in non-equivalent #521)). More concrete importing file's validating errors (mentioned in #521). About login error messages: #910, #739, #911. Other errors: #913, #920, #923, #924, #972, #1052. See also: #485; #521; #150, #157; #651, #723, #23, #1052.\r\n12. ~Use Alpine versions of ~Nginx,~ Node and Python (Docker)? (declined in #659 but then implemented in #795 and partially reversed in #1110; maybe a bad idea, see:  docker-library/docs#904, pypa/manylinux#37; see also #794, #1112).~\r\n13. ~Localize roles and document types in UI (#605; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/976#issuecomment-692186583; implemented in #976).~\r\n14. ~Current number of documents on annotation page should be updated on each annotation (mentioned in #594; implemented in #897).~\r\n15. ~Show current user name (#604; implemented in #664;  improved by #680).~\r\n16. Implement project edit page (#1080; see also #1114).\r\n17. ~Allow digits as annotation keys (#599; implemented in #603).~\r\n18. Hide unaccessible abilities from UI (#922; mentioned in #920, #866 (implemented in #916), #920, #924, #927).\r\n19. ~Show import/export labels format (#591; implemented in #651).~\r\n20. ~Allow to import unlabeled datasets (#658; implemented in #861; mentioned in #516, then merged to #521).~\r\n21. ~On Statistics page, show documents per user statistics, also (in addition to labels per user) (#486; implemented in #678).~ See also p.58.\r\n22. ~Make documentation for: superuser's password changing. (#628; implemented in #856; see also #622).~\r\n23. ~On project's subpages, display project's name (#621; implemented in #691).~\r\n24. ~Incorporate API client (https://github.com/afparsons/doccano_api_client, https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/299#issuecomment-557037552; doccano/doccano-client#3).~\r\n25. \"Approved\" filter (#725, merged to #505, has been merged to #280); #1060.\r\n26. Display user's current role (#881; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/758#issuecomment-626325760).\r\n27. Display label `id`s column on Labels page alongside their names (#813, merged to #816).\r\n28. Provide a setting: the order of labels (#816; mentioned in #1028).\r\n29. Import datasets using doccano's exported files (#482; implemented in #958; see also #826, #848, #889, #961, #1015).\r\n30. Implement \"view only\" role (#413; implemented in #430).\r\n31. Implement dataset import using JSON (#454; implemented in #777).\r\n32. Each annotator sees how many documents are being annotated in the project, by him (#830).\r\n33. For each project, introduce a property: minimal number of annotations (of a given document) to indicate the document as \"done\" (#831; #947; see also #114).\r\n34. ~Allow annotation approvers to change annotations (#703; implemented in #766).~\r\n35. ~Highlight current page in menu (#833; implemented in #899).~\r\n36. Implement document filters: by labels and annotators (#839 (merged in non-equivalent #280)).\r\n37. Warn and/or fail if default admin's password hasn't been changed, in production (#857; see also #748).\r\n38. Set `-x` and `-e`, `-u` on each Bash script (#860).\r\n39. Get rid of v0.x code (related: #786, #1088)..\r\n40. Document and/or minimize production and development difference (#810; mentioned in #925).\r\n41. Align component versions (#870; implemented in #842). Upgrade component versions.\r\n42. Implement an option: confirmation button on Annotation page (declined in #869; mentioned in #477).\r\n43.

Show statuses of documents on Dataset page (#928).\r\n49. Implement user creation (declined in #930).\r\n50. Use color in labels selector (on Annotation page) (#829).\r\n51. Implement an option to hide some metadata (#1079).\r\n52. ~Export annotations' timestamps (#963; implemented in #964).~\r\n53. ~Implement: live a comment on a document (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/966#issuecomment-685565644, #1050; implemented in #1155).~\r\n54.

pull request adds a small set of scripts to deploy Doccano within an offline network environment.\r\n\r\nThis work was done by myself for internal use but I think it could be helpful for other users that are considering Doccano as an annotation tool in offline environments.\r\n\r\nThe scripts mainly do the following tasks:\r\n - For preparation: Build the Docker images\r\n - For preparation: Load required APT packages\r\n - For preparation: Download referenced JS/CSS/fonts from CDNs and provide them as static assets\r\n - For offline deployment: Install APT packages and load Docker images\r\n\r\nThe focus of this pull request is to keep the other repository code as decoupled as possible. Due to this approach, there is no need for maintaining a hardcoded list of used CDN resources.\r\n\r\nYour feedback would be highly appreciated. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4647783231,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ2NDc3ODMyMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4647783231","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T23:15:02Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4647873284,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY0Nzg3MzI4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4647873284","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T23:54:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
