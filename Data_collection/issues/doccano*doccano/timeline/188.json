For example, I had to debug all the way through Django since it was not listed in the requirements. When I run the doccano server directly from the docker image in a VM, it works. On my native machine, it works only when I delete the image and then re-initiate it. Running the server once it's been stared and then stopped, does not work. \r\n\r\n`docker rm <container>`\r\n`docker container ls`\r\n`docker run -d --name doccano -p 8000:80 chakkiworks/doccano`\r\n\r\nthen it works, but I lose all my projects and need to create user profiles from scratch.
