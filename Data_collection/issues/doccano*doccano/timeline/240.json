is the exact same question as posed in #240 except that the solutions proposed in that thread didn't work for me.\r\n\r\nThe initial question as copied from #240 (from @littleji) is:\r\n```\r\nafter export the labeled dataset, like this\r\n{\"id\": 12881, \"text\": \"some text \", \"annotations\": [{\"label\": 3225, \"user\": 1}], \"meta\": {}}\r\nhow can I get the label-id:label-name map to identify the label name?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI deployed using the commands\r\n```\r\ndocker pull chakkiworks/doccano\r\ndocker container create --name doccano \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_USERNAME=admin\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_PASSWORD=password\" \\\r\n  -p 8000:8000 chakkiworks/doccano\r\n``` \r\nsince the `docker-compose` method was giving me errors on the server side.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @rbagd in #240 I would like to copy the DB file from the docker container to local, but it seems that my label / results are not saved in `$CONTAINER_ID:/doccano/app/db.sqlite3` (also the table names are slightly different from the thread, so I'm guessing the docker container was updated since then).\r\nSo I'm wondering if there is any other db (such as postgres) that I could use to get the label information? Any other solutions would work perfectly also.
