But right now we devote most of our time in useful features or solving bugs. The documentation might come late. \r\nAs for the doccano templates, I will give whatever I know for your implementation. \r\n* Backend: Django\r\n* Front: Vue\r\n* CSS: Bulma\r\n\r\nAs for your question, why doccano use square brackets. The reason is to distinguish between Vue syntax and Django syntax. We use square brackets `[[ body ]]` for Vue and curly brackets `{{ body }}` for Django. \r\nYou can find the delimiters setting in js file, such as [label.js](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/blob/master/app/server/static/js/label.js#L7), document_classification.js, seq2seq.js, and so on. \r\n\r\nIn your case, because text is in [document_classification.html](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/blob/master/app/server/templates/annotation/document_classification.html#L34\r\n), you might need to change the [document_classification.js](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/blob/master/app/server/static/js/document_classification.js) for autoescape. I am not familiar with Vue. That's all I can provide. \r\n\r\nHope this could help you.
