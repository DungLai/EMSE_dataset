I've tried with that and received: \r\n```\r\n{'detail': 'Empty content'}\r\n```\r\nSo that is at least [_different_](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/blob/e1b5e9d5dfb3b0d87795037d0d8e7e4aa33a29e6/app/api/views.py#L215). We'll see if that constitutes as progress or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: I got a `<Response [201]>`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrequests.post(\r\n        'http://<URL>/v1/projects/1/docs/upload',\r\n        files={'file': ('d1.json', open('d1.json', 'rb'))},\r\n        data={'file': ('d1.json', open('d1.json', 'rb')), 'format': 'json'},\r\n        headers = {\r\n            'Authorization': 'Token {token}'.format(token=token)\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the response is positive, the document does not appear to have been added to the project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate 3:  Confirmed working! This also works with a preauthorized `requests.Session()`, as shown below. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# this is part of the Client class\r\n\r\n    def upload(\r\n        self,\r\n        project_id: str,\r\n        file_format: str,\r\n        file_name: str,\r\n        file_path: str = './',\r\n    ) -> requests.models.Response:\r\n        \"\"\"        \r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        url = '{}/v1/projects/{}/docs/upload'.format(self.entrypoint, project_id)\r\n        files = {'file': (file_name, open(os.path.join(file_path, file_name), 'rb'))}\r\n        data = {'file': (file_name, open(os.path.join(file_path, file_name), 'rb')), 'format': file_format}\r\n        return self.client.post(url, files=files, data=data)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/555692983/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"afparsons","id":12258001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjU4MDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12258001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons","html_url":"https://github.com/afparsons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afparsons/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2812864448,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgxMjg2NDQ0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2812864448","actor":{"login":"louisguitton","id":7823843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7823843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton","html_url":"https://github.com/louisguitton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisguitton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-19T20:17:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
