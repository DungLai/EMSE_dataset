I don't think this is a problem at your end, I can reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThe backend correctly identifies and sets flags for the Okta / other social auth, but unfortunately, it cannot be used with the current version of the Doccano frontend.\r\n\r\nWhat I had built was an integration with the previously used Doccano frontend (that is still under `app/server`). I can see that since https://github.com/doccano/doccano/commit/362df6373af833bb16ee02a4708db5a811f03d5c the frontend is being pointed to the new Nuxt.JS frontend. That version doesn't appear to have the ability to use the social auth and doesn't thus have all of the features that the old UI did. I am not familiar with Nuxt / Vue enough to be able to contribute the changes that'd be required, but if someone can point me to the file(s) that'd need to be touched, I'm happy to take a stab (cc @Hironsan, @icoxfog417).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a workaround right now might be to build the Docker container from source, while checking out to an older commit. I tried building the container for 6e76b9586b9c95f27e9432a456f4213d2febef53 and got it to work. (One other change is required in `requirements.txt` there for it to build and run successfully: pin the max version of `pyjwt` as `pyjwt>=1.7.1,<2.0`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/800822997/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"setu4993","id":1833708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1833708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993","html_url":"https://github.com/setu4993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setu4993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4468276113,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2ODI3NjExMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4468276113","actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T06:08:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4468276118,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NjgyNzYxMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4468276118","actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T06:08:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4468276122,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2ODI3NjEyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4468276122","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T06:08:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4468276126,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NjgyNzYxMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4468276126","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcj

I am not very familiar with Django and social auth, to be honest, so not sure what the right order is, it seemed correct to me when I looked at the documentation. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n**PS:** \r\nI would rather prefer someone getting the login with okta working on the latest Doccano code version. But it is painful as it is not working in the older version as well.
