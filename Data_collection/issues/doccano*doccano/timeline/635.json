Not updating since 1.1.0 (26 January 2021).**\r\n\r\nGood day!\r\n\r\nThank you for your GREAT work!\r\n\r\nI have some enhancement requests... Just for a note, maybe. I will update them permanently.\r\n\r\n1. ~URLs should become to a corresponding state. On Dataset page, URL is `/projects/4/dataset`. But refreshing the page redirects to `/projects/4` (#595; implemented in #897; see also #992, 976).~\r\n2. ~Pagination, \"rows per page\" should change URL (#595; also mentioned in #540, #578; implemented in #897). And moreover: every view state should have its own URL.~\r\n3. Put label hints and key shortcut hints back to Annotation page (#635 (merged in non-equivalent #834); mentioned in #509, #627, #776, #991, #1035; see also #829, #834).\r\n4. Show number of imported rows (#1078).\r\n5. Show number of deleting rows only in confirm dialog.

(#523, #631; implemented in #1115)\r\n10. ~Add importing of Excel and CoNLL files to UI (#650; implemented in #872; mentioned in #847).~\r\n11. Use API error's messages in UI instead of common error messages (#601 (merged in non-equivalent #521)). More concrete importing file's validating errors (mentioned in #521). About login error messages: #910, #739, #911. Other errors: #913, #920, #923, #924, #972, #1052. See also: #485; #521; #150, #157; #651, #723, #23, #1052.\r\n12. ~Use Alpine versions of ~Nginx,~ Node and Python (Docker)? (declined in #659 but then implemented in #795 and partially reversed in #1110; maybe a bad idea, see:  docker-library/docs#904, pypa/manylinux#37; see also #794, #1112).~\r\n13. ~Localize roles and document types in UI (#605; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/976#issuecomment-692186583; implemented in #976).~\r\n14. ~Current number of documents on annotation page should be updated on each annotation (mentioned in #594; implemented in #897).~\r\n15. ~Show current user name (#604; implemented in #664;  improved by #680).~\r\n16. Implement project edit page (#1080; see also #1114).\r\n17. ~Allow digits as annotation keys (#599; implemented in #603).~\r\n18. Hide unaccessible abilities from UI (#922; mentioned in #920, #866 (implemented in #916), #920, #924, #927).\r\n19. ~Show import/export labels format (#591; implemented in #651).~\r\n20. ~Allow to import unlabeled datasets (#658; implemented in #861; mentioned in #516, then merged to #521).~\r\n21. ~On Statistics page, show documents per user statistics, also (in addition to labels per user) (#486; implemented in #678).~ See also p.58.\r\n22. ~Make documentation for: superuser's password changing. (#628; implemented in #856; see also #622).~\r\n23. ~On project's subpages, display project's name (#621; implemented in #691).~\r\n24. ~Incorporate API client (https://github.com/afparsons/doccano_api_client, https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/299#issuecomment-557037552; doccano/doccano-client#3).~\r\n25. \"Approved\" filter (#725, merged to #505, has been merged to #280); #1060.\r\n26. Display user's current role (#881; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/758#issuecomment-626325760).\r\n27. Display label `id`s column on Labels page alongside their names (#813, merged to #816).\r\n28. Provide a setting: the order of labels (#816; mentioned in #1028).\r\n29. Import datasets using doccano's exported files (#482; implemented in #958; see also #826, #848, #889, #961, #1015).\r\n30. Implement \"view only\" role (#413; implemented in #430).\r\n31. Implement dataset import using JSON (#454; implemented in #777).\r\n32. Each annotator sees how many documents are being annotated in the project, by him (#830).\r\n33. For each project, introduce a property: minimal number of annotations (of a given document) to indicate the document as \"done\" (#831; #947; see also #114).\r\n34. ~Allow annotation approvers to change annotations (#703; implemented in #766).~\r\n35. ~Highlight current page in menu (#833; implemented in #899).~\r\n36. Implement document filters: by labels and annotators (#839 (merged in non-equivalent #280)).\r\n37. Warn and/or fail if default admin's password hasn't been changed, in production (#857; see also #748).\r\n38. Set `-x` and `-e`, `-u` on each Bash script (#860).\r\n39. Get rid of v0.x code (related: #786, #1088)..\r\n40. Document and/or minimize production and development difference (#810; mentioned in #925).\r\n41. Align component versions (#870; implemented in #842). Upgrade component versions.\r\n42. Implement an option: confirmation button on Annotation page (declined in #869; mentioned in #477).\r\n43.

Show statuses of documents on Dataset page (#928).\r\n49. Implement user creation (declined in #930).\r\n50. Use color in labels selector (on Annotation page) (#829).\r\n51. Implement an option to hide some metadata (#1079).\r\n52. ~Export annotations' timestamps (#963; implemented in #964).~\r\n53. ~Implement: live a comment on a document (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/966#issuecomment-685565644, #1050; implemented in #1155).~\r\n54.

already, using the API).\r\n\r\nSigning off on the entered labels, accepting them means clicking in the left side _checkbox-like icon_. The annoying part here is that, in order to go to the next document I need to go to the top right corner of my screen. This is tedious and slows down the manual validation of annotations. It's actually nicely visible when looking at the _Annotate the dataset_ video featured on the home-screen.\r\n\r\nQuestion here would be if it's possible to have a mechanism that does the acknowledgment _and goes on to the next document_ all within a _single action_. For example using a hot-key and (for mouse-users) a button.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\nA fresh clone and docker-compose using the `dev`

to reproduce the behaviour\r\n---------\r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks for all of your hard work ! \r\n\r\nI installed doccano using two methods :\r\n - the simple docker create / docker run \r\n - the docker-compose using docker-compose.prod.yml\r\n\r\nI'm interested in doing NER so I need to annotate my texts using a lot of labels.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, the docker-compose version is newer than the simple docker one (I haven't had time to look into that yet, could you tell me what triggers an update on the doccano/doccano image on docker hub ?)\r\n\r\nThe issue I have is that in the docker-compose version I need to select a sentence to see a list of all the annotation since they are not visible onscreen otherwise. But I absolutely need to have a list of annotation visible somewhere on screen for the annotator. Is it a new feature to have a \"simpler\" design that removes the list of annotation ? Is there a way to add an option to make it visible again ?\r\n\r\nAlso on the right of the screen there is a \"key value\" table and I'm not sure what's supposed to be printed here.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Linux (Centos 7)\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3\r\n*   When you install doccano: docker and docker-compose\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kuraga","id":1063219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1063219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga","html_url":"https://github.com/kuraga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuraga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T08:57:09Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T08:57:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1035","id":735135807,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzUxMzU4MDc=","number":1035,"title":"Tags
