I agree with you. For Jsonl exports you get 'data' as a key instead of 'text'. When transforming you get KeyError: 'text'. I would suggest manually changing the key from 'data' to 'text'. Doccano should update to export keys as 'text' instead of 'data'.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/1100955583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gilokip","id":47002244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDAyMjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47002244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip","html_url":"https://github.com/gilokip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilokip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6486465071,"node_id":"MCIPE_lADOB-j9wM5A096LzwAAAAGCn5ov","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/6486465071","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T22:29:22Z","project_card":{"id":79464275,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/79464275","project_id":4208315,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/4208315","column_name":"In
