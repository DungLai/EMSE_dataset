From a technical perspective, I've found no slow downs to huge numbers of projects or projects with lots of documents. The project can be a super useful organizational structure. I tend to create lots of projects with a limited scope for one user. When that user logs on they only see their projects so it's not cluttered. Tools like the doccano-client make it extremely easy to ingest many projects with a similar naming structure to aggregate for analysis. That being said, if your end goal calls for three huge buckets then that's probably what the doccano project structure should look like.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/1293459023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"david-engelmann","id":81196676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTk2Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81196676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann","html_url":"https://github.com/david-engelmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-engelmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7681855395,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB-j9wM5U59s8zwAAAAHJ38-j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/7681855395","actor":{"login":"lance132","id":51332978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMyOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51332978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132","html_url":"https://github.com/lance132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-27T12:33:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7681855406,"node_id":"SE_lADOB-j9wM5U59s8zwAAAAHJ38-u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/7681855406","actor":{"login":"lance132","id":51332978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMyOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51332978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132","html_url":"https://github.com/lance132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-27T12:33:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/1298947710","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/2034#issuecomment-1298947710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2034","id":1298947710,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-j9wM5NbF5-","user":{"login":"lance132","id":51332978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMyOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51332978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132","html_url":"https://github.com/lance132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-01T18:36:04Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T18:36:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@david-engelmann
