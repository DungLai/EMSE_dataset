apologies for replying late, \r\ni think RTL is indeed supported by default because the sentences is rendered correctly, both in the dataset view and initially in the annotation view.\r\n\r\nthe problem appears when i start by annotating an entity,\r\nwith inspection i found that the way the annotation box its structured is via a div containing a span with the sentence text in it:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51781349/82133821-966ea400-97f0-11ea-9361-01fa3020c714.png)\r\n\r\nwhen an annotation for an entity is added, that span is then divided to multiple spans, one for text before the entity annotation box, one for the entity annotation box itself and one for the text afterwards.\r\n\r\nthe problem comes from the order of those spans, by default they are ordered left to right, therefore the sentence gets out of order after the annotation:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51781349/82133830-abe3ce00-97f0-11ea-99d7-667d5327212d.png)\r\n\r\nwhen i add those properties to the parent div ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278767/how-to-order-inline-elements-in-rtl-mode))\r\n```\r\n-webkit-flex-direction: row-reverse;  // disabled\r\n  flex-direction: row-reverse;\r\n```\r\ni get the order correct, but it also breaks it for English likewise.\r\n\r\nFinally,  i don't have enough experience in front-end though, so i might be doing something wrong here of course ✋ \r\n\r\nRegarding the test cases, i don't know how to provide such cases in a helpful way, because it's mainly UI thing.\r\nthe example i'm using in this issue is the sentence: \r\n\"هذه جملة اختبار أولى، وهذه ثانية\"\r\nand the correct annotation should appear as follows:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51781349/82134069-bbb0e180-97f3-11ea-89fd-4dc4dfed5fc0.png)\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/629731868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"muhnashX","id":51781349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgxMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51781349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX","html_url":"https://github.com/muhnashX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3344109367,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0NDEwOTM2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/3344109367","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-17T02:09:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3344109368,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDQxMDkzNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/3344109368","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-17T02:09:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/629732167","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/769#issuecomment-629732167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/769","id":629732167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTczMjE2Nw==","user":{"login":"muhnashX","id":51781349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgxMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51781349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX","html_url":"https://github.com/muhnashX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T02:13:12Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T02:13:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For

Forgot to mention that i tried to enable the RTL feature as instructed, and tried also editing nuxt config to pass the flag rtl=true to Vuetify and didn't have any difference.\r\n\r\nWell, this is quite inaccurate, configuring rtl=true for Vuetify worked but by turning the whole app to RTL (which isn't a good solution). it was just me using the production docker compose file, therefore any changes i make wasn't reflected :disappointed: \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, after some tinkering i managed to get it to work well for both English and Arabic for the sequence labeling task (the one i'm currently using)\r\n\r\non a fork i modified EntityItemBox component such that:\r\n* the CSS style classes is defined in a [list in the data section](https://github.com/muhnashX/doccano/blob/master/frontend/components/organisms/annotation/EntityItemBox.vue#L92), and used in the template rather than writing them explicitly.  \r\n\r\n* then i define CSS class: [rtl](https://github.com/muhnashX/doccano/blob/master/frontend/components/organisms/annotation/EntityItemBox.vue#L235) with just ``` direction: rtl;``` property\r\n(this to control the order of all the children spans)\r\n\r\n* finally, i used the  [```beforeUpdate```](https://github.com/muhnashX/doccano/blob/master/frontend/components/organisms/annotation/EntityItemBox.vue#L131)  hook to do the logic:\r\nget the text and check whether it's Arabic or not (the first char only)\r\nif it's, append it to the style classes (if not already there)\r\nif it's not, remove it from the style classes (if already there)\r\n\r\nif this seems to be an acceptable solution, i can open a pull request and review it further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/631148743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"muhnashX","id":51781349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgxMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51781349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX","html_url":"https://github.com/muhnashX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3535850982,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzUzNTg1MDk4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/3535850982","actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-11T01:20:02Z","rename":{"from":"RTL

I could not find a local file called `EntityItemBox.vue` or even (@bakrianoo) `nuxt.config.js`. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have experience with JS, is there still something I can do? \r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/798329333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Maroussia","id":28222084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjIyMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28222084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia","html_url":"https://github.com/Maroussia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maroussia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4453807615,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ1MzgwNzYxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4453807615","actor":{"login":"bakrianoo","id":14326057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzI2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14326057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo","html_url":"https://github.com/bakrianoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-13T12:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4453807618,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NTM4MDc2MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4453807618","actor":{"login":"bakrianoo","id":14326057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzI2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14326057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo","html_url":"https://github.com/bakrianoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakrianoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-13T12:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4453807619,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ1MzgwNzYxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4453807619","actor":{"login":"muhnashX","id":51781349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgxMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51781349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX","html_url":"https://github.com/muhnashX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhnashX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-13T12:55:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
