solution will dynmically pull the correct ubuntu 16 ami id no matter what region you are in.\r\n\r\nDocker ports:\r\nNot sure if I am missing something here, but the app serves on port 8000, but the user data in the cfn template maps 80 to 80. So I changed it to map 80 to 8000. It works when I launch it in my AWS account.\r\n\r\nInstance type:\r\nThe cfn template asks the user to select an instance type. But then it used a hard coded one anyways. So I changed it to use the selected instance type. I assume this was the intended behavior? I also added t3 instance types. Depending on the region you are in, different instance types may or may not be available.
