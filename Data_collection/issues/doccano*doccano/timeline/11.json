If a user import the data with external_id, this will be contained in the export file. \r\n\r\nInput file may look like this:\r\n\r\n`import.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"external_id\": 1}\r\n```\r\nand the exported file will look like this:\r\n\r\n`output.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"doc_id\": 2023, \"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"labels\": [\"news\"], \"username\": \"root\", \"metadata\": {\"external_id\": 1}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Input and output example for document classification task\r\n\r\n**If a user wants to import data with some labels, the user has to provide an `external_id`.** \r\nFor document classification task, the JSON file should looks like this:\r\n\r\n`import.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"external_id\": 1, \"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}\r\n```\r\nIn the annoation process, we add `label3` to this document. \r\n`output.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"doc_id\": 2023, \"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"labels\":  [\"label1\", \"label2\", \"labels3\"], \"username\": \"root\", \"metadata\": {\"external_id\": 1}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Input and output example for sequence labeling task\r\n\r\nJust for a simple demo, I only shows the example of JSON format. The CSV follow the same idea.\r\n\r\nFor sequence labeling task, the imported annotation key should be names as `entities`.\r\n`import.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"external_id\": 1, \"entities\": [[0, 3, \"ORG\"], [11, 17, \"GPE\"]]}\r\n```\r\nIn the annoation process, we add annotate `British` as `GPE`. \r\n\r\n`output.json`\r\n```JSON\r\n{\"doc_id\": 2023, \"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"entities\": [[0, 3, \"ORG\"], [11, 17, \"GPE\"], [34, 41, \"GPE\"]], \"username\": \"root\", \"metadata\": {\"external_id\": 1}}\r\n```\r\nThe key names of `labels` and `entities` should be the same with the [output format](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/wiki/Export-File-Formats). \r\n\r\n## About the shortcut\r\n\r\nRight now, each label has to be set with a shortcut while creating the label. I am working on this #73 so that a shortcut will be optional. In this case, if the user import data with labels. These label can have no shortcut.

Bulk import the way it is implemented is good and easy for a Document-only content, but it becomes complicated when one has to import linked annotations (which also involves creation of labels on the flight). There are several ways to accelerate that [e.g.  using transactions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40789962/django-bulk-create-with-related-objects), but it does not seem that recent design changes can accommodate any of those tricks.  Another way is to run bulk import and store IDs -- but that requires accumulating annotations in-memory, which is not an elegant solution.\r\n\r\nSecond, as to format, I am using dictionary to store entities, because it is a cleaner, and JSON allows it, so why not.

will you please elaborate on:\r\n\r\n> If a user wants to import data with some labels, the user has to provide an `external_id`.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, the metadata feature is primarily meant for external use [(see #55 comment)](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/pull/55#issue-241210891):\r\n\r\n> The main use-case is to be able to match exported data with your existing corpus by providing `external_id` in the imported file, although there are other use-cases.\r\n\r\nDepending on a user supplied value to link a document and annotation sounds riskier than using the `document ForeignKey` in the [annotation tables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10768193/50937370-a799f900-14b6-11e9-86a2-d6fedf42e26f.png).  \r\n\r\n## Notes while trying to implement feature using `ForeignKey`\r\n\r\nI also ran into the some of the  `bulk_create` concerns raised by @DSLituiev. The [`bulk_create` documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-create) states: \r\n\r\n>  If the model’s primary key is an AutoField it does not retrieve and set the primary key attribute, as save() does, unless the database backend supports it (currently PostgreSQL).\r\n\r\n1. A workaround I have attempted is to replace all `models.AutoField` with `models.UUIDField` in [`0001_initial.py`](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/blob/23a1aff7880e3e5c2fbd6f0930edab01782367cc/app/server/migrations/0001_initial.py#L20), however, I am running into issues getting `models.UUIDField` and `sqlite3` to work together. \r\n\r\n2. The other approach would be to use transactions like @DSLituiev suggested. Replacing `bulk_create`s with [this approach](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36751395/update-multiple-objects-at-once-in-django) looks promising to me.\r\n\r\nDo either of these approaches look acceptable?  If so, let me know and I will continue to work in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/463439122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JoshuaPostel","id":13628629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjI4NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13628629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshuaPostel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaPostel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2138367278,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzODM2NzI3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2138367278","actor":{"login":"DSLituiev","id":8426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MjYyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev","html_url":"https://github.com/DSLituiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-14T00:54:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138367279,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzgzNjcyNzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2138367279","actor":{"login":"DSLituiev","id":8426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MjYyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev","html_url":"https://github.com/DSLituiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-14T00:54:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138367280,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzODM2NzI4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2138367280","actor":{"login":"BrambleXu","id":10768193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY4MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10768193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu","html_url":"https://github.com/BrambleXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrambleXu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-14T00:54:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138367283,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzgzNjcyODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2138367283","actor":{"login":

\r\n> If a user wants to import data with some labels, the user has to provide an `external_id`.\r\n\r\nThis means using `external_id` to link document and its corresponding labels. In my understanding, `document ForeignKey` you said is `project`, right? If so, how do you know which document has what labels?\r\n\r\nWhen we import data, text would be saved to `Document` class, and labels would be saved to `Label` class. But this saving process is under by  `bulk_create`, so we don't know which labels belong to which document. That is where `external_id` works. In `DocumentAnnotation` class, we can use `external_id` to link `Labels.id` to `Document.id`. So we can know which document has what labels.  \r\n\r\n![image 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10768193/52766754-8a36ec80-306b-11e9-8cbf-9c6b9d5c6829.png)\r\n> Models Structure\r\n\r\nRight now only the Document class has the metadata filed (contain `external_id`).
