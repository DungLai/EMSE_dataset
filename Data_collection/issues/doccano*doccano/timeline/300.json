However, when I tried to access the app using the Public DNS of the EC2 instance, the webpage prompts \"Site Not Reachable\". \r\n\r\nI also used the port number(80) specified by Doccano, but it wouldn't work. \r\n\r\nSimilar to #300 \r\n\r\nAm I missing something? I would be grateful for any help provided.
