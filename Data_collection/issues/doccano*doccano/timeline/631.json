Not updating since 1.1.0 (26 January 2021).**\r\n\r\nGood day!\r\n\r\nThank you for your GREAT work!\r\n\r\nI have some enhancement requests... Just for a note, maybe. I will update them permanently.\r\n\r\n1. ~URLs should become to a corresponding state. On Dataset page, URL is `/projects/4/dataset`. But refreshing the page redirects to `/projects/4` (#595; implemented in #897; see also #992, 976).~\r\n2. ~Pagination, \"rows per page\" should change URL (#595; also mentioned in #540, #578; implemented in #897). And moreover: every view state should have its own URL.~\r\n3. Put label hints and key shortcut hints back to Annotation page (#635 (merged in non-equivalent #834); mentioned in #509, #627, #776, #991, #1035; see also #829, #834).\r\n4. Show number of imported rows (#1078).\r\n5. Show number of deleting rows only in confirm dialog. It's difficult to delete many rows (#1077).\r\n6. ~Add First/Last pagination links (#615; implemented in #981).~\r\n7. ~IMHO menu should be opened on Project page and/or subpages by default (implementated in #598).~\r\n8. Make limits configurable (#708, #1119, #1124; mentioned in #514 (merged to #521), #575, #706, #853, #1175).\r\n9. Removing rows freezes page. Could it be improved? (#523, #631; implemented in #1115)\r\n10. ~Add importing of Excel and CoNLL files to UI (#650; implemented in #872; mentioned in #847).~\r\n11. Use API error's messages in UI instead of common error messages (#601 (merged in non-equivalent #521)). More concrete importing file's validating errors (mentioned in #521). About login error messages: #910, #739, #911. Other errors: #913, #920, #923, #924, #972, #1052. See also: #485; #521; #150, #157; #651, #723, #23, #1052.\r\n12. ~Use Alpine versions of ~Nginx,~ Node and Python (Docker)? (declined in #659 but then implemented in #795 and partially reversed in #1110; maybe a bad idea, see:  docker-library/docs#904, pypa/manylinux#37; see also #794, #1112).~\r\n13. ~Localize roles and document types in UI (#605; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/976#issuecomment-692186583; implemented in #976).~\r\n14. ~Current number of documents on annotation page should be updated on each annotation (mentioned in #594; implemented in #897).~\r\n15. ~Show current user name (#604; implemented in #664;  improved by #680).~\r\n16. Implement project edit page (#1080; see also #1114).\r\n17. ~Allow digits as annotation keys (#599; implemented in #603).~\r\n18. Hide unaccessible abilities from UI (#922; mentioned in #920, #866 (implemented in #916), #920, #924, #927).\r\n19. ~Show import/export labels format (#591; implemented in #651).~\r\n20. ~Allow to import unlabeled datasets (#658; implemented in #861; mentioned in #516, then merged to #521).~\r\n21. ~On Statistics page, show documents per user statistics, also (in addition to labels per user) (#486; implemented in #678).~ See also p.58.\r\n22. ~Make documentation for: superuser's password changing. (#628; implemented in #856; see also #622).~\r\n23. ~On project's subpages, display project's name (#621; implemented in #691).~\r\n24. ~Incorporate API client (https://github.com/afparsons/doccano_api_client, https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/299#issuecomment-557037552; doccano/doccano-client#3).~\r\n25. \"Approved\" filter (#725, merged to #505, has been merged to #280); #1060.\r\n26. Display user's current role (#881; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/758#issuecomment-626325760).\r\n27. Display label `id`s column on Labels page alongside their names (#813, merged to #816).\r\n28. Provide a setting: the order of labels (#816; mentioned in #1028).\r\n29. Import datasets using doccano's exported files (#482; implemented in #958; see also #826, #848, #889, #961, #1015).\r\n30. Implement \"view only\" role (#413; implemented in #430).\r\n31. Implement dataset import using JSON (#454; implemented in #777).\r\n32. Each annotator sees how many documents are being annotated in the project, by him (#830).\r\n33. For each project, introduce a property: minimal number of annotations (of a given document) to indicate the document as \"done\" (#831; #947; see also #114).\r\n34. ~Allow annotation approvers to change annotations (#703; implemented in #766).~\r\n35. ~Highlight current page in menu (#833; implemented in #899).~\r\n36. Implement document filters: by labels and annotators (#839 (merged in non-equivalent #280)).\r\n37. Warn and/or fail if default admin's password hasn't been changed, in production (#857; see also #748).\r\n38. Set `-x` and `-e`, `-u` on each Bash script (#860).\r\n39. Get rid of v0.x code (related: #786, #1088)..\r\n40. Document and/or minimize production and development difference (#810; mentioned in #925).\r\n41. Align component versions (#870; implemented in #842). Upgrade component versions.\r\n42. Implement an option: confirmation button on Annotation page (declined in #869; mentioned in #477).\r\n43. Implement label groups (#5, #877 (merged in non-equivalent #477); see also #461, #477, #829, #635, #869).\r\n44. Store label ids and user ids on export (#295; implemented in #889).\r\n45. _Show all removing elements  (dependencies) on confirmation._\r\n46. Project export and import (#901).\r\n47. ~Allow annotator to update/delete other's annotations if annotations are shared (#531, #705; see also #866, #629; implemented in #916).~\r\n48. Show statuses of documents on Dataset page (#928).\r\n49. Implement user creation (declined in #930).\r\n50. Use color in labels selector (on Annotation page) (#829).\r\n51. Implement an option to hide some metadata (#1079).\r\n52. ~Export annotations' timestamps (#963; implemented in #964).~\r\n53. ~Implement: live a comment on a document (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/966#issuecomment-685565644, #1050; implemented in #1155).~\r\n54. Prebuild Docker images (#971; see also: #786, #1088, #783, #1127, #1231).\r\n55. ~Localize interface (#479; implemented in #976).~\r\n56. \"Delete all documents\" button (implemented in #979).\r\n57.
