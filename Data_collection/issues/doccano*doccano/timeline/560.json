pull request is about the [requested feature to be able to connect doccano to an LDAP server](https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/560).\r\n\r\nLDAP support for doccano is for many organizations a very important feature since they already have an elaborated LDAP authentication infrastructure. Also group management is often included in their existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe provided solution integrates seamlessly into doccano. Only another Django authentication backend and its configuration are needed. The configuration for LDAP should be part of the existing environment variables. Therefore it integrates well with the existing flow.\r\n\r\nSince the LDAP authentication backend integrates well into Django applications, the existing login page of doccano doesn't need to be changed. Everything should work fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/586/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3181763959,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQzMTgxNzYzOTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/3181763959","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T06:40:01Z","project_card":{"id":35456319,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/35456319","project_id":3566476,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/3566476","column_name":"To

I opened the request of an LDAP authentication some time ago (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/560). Unfortunately, a pull request trying to solve it, was never merged and apparently is outdated (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/586). \r\nOver the time, I learned some more tools regarding authentification. The most promising I think is keycloak, as it's possible to use several systems behind it (ldap etc). Thus, my feature request is, if it would be possible to implement keycloak support into doccano? I found a [module for django](https://django-keycloak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and hope, that for a doccano expert it's not that complicated to
