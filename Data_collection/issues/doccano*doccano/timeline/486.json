We had thought that the progress bar and pie chart were representative of how many samples (\"documents\") had been marked as \"approved\". \r\n\r\nThanks @cohen-ori for explaining this behavior.\r\nInterestingly, this observed behavior does not appear to be present in [this screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fb1384fdacf5ec153d05bd34846aa485764dbbf8/68747470733a2f2f7773312e73696e61696d672e636e2f6c617267652f303036744e62527767793166796a773676363834726a3331723330753074626a2e6a7067) from [the tutorial](https://github.com/doccano/doccano/wiki/A-Tutorial-For-Sequence-Labeling-Project). \r\n\r\nAs an end user, this is unexpected. If the counter is intentionally designed and implemented this way, then we find it to violate the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).\r\n\r\nWithout looking at the source code, I would assume that this is an artifact from the way progress tracking works in classification projects; a classified sample (\"document\") has just one label, so tracking the number of labels over the number of samples functions as a completion counter.

Display user's current role (#881; mentioned in https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/758#issuecomment-626325760).\r\n27.

Implement dataset import using JSON (#454; implemented in #777).\r\n32. Each annotator sees how many documents are being annotated in the project, by him (#830).\r\n33. For each project, introduce a property: minimal number of annotations (of a given document) to indicate the document as \"done\" (#831; #947; see also #114).\r\n34. ~Allow annotation approvers to change annotations (#703; implemented in #766).~\r\n35. ~Highlight current page in menu (#833; implemented in #899).~\r\n36. Implement document filters: by labels and annotators (#839 (merged in non-equivalent #280)).\r\n37.
