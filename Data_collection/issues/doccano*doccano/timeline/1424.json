Is this something that is expected? \r\n\r\nI alternatively had each json that didn't have a label not have an entry in them but that still screwed up the ordering. \r\n\r\nAre we not allowed to upload unlabeled and labeled examples? We are pre-labeling using regex (among other things) and need to verify that both labeled and unlabeled are correct.
