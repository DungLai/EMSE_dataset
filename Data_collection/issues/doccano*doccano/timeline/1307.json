problem solved. There is 2 problemes and you need to do 2 moves to fix this problems\r\n1. \"NameError: Custom REST Request is not found\"  Error. This error was raised becouse of some changes in auto-labeling-pipeline library.\r\nFor fixing it I made monkey patch in Doccano/Doccano project (app/api/views/auto_labeling.py). \r\n```\r\n@classmethod\r\ndef monkey_patched_find(cls, model_name: str) -> Type[RequestModel]:\r\n        for subclass in RequestModel.__subclasses__():\r\n            if subclass.Config.title == model_name:\r\n                return subclass\r\n        raise NameError(f'{model_name} is not found.')\r\n\r\nRequestModelFactory.find = monkey_patched_find\r\n```\r\nThis is fast solution.\r\n2. After first error you will have 2nd. \"RequestModelFactory has no object build()'\". For fixing it u need to remove this code (same file,  AutoLabelingConfigParameterTest class)\r\nGood

to reproduce the behaviour\r\n---------\r\nWhen sending (Testing) the Post request inside the creation of a costum rest api service for auto-labelling the request payload (which goes to doccano/django) looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 99999,\r\n  \"model_name\": \"CustomRESTRequestModel\",\r\n  \"model_attrs\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"http://0.0.0.0:5001/process-single/\",\r\n    \"method\": \"POST\",\r\n    \"params\": {},\r\n    \"headers\": {},\r\n    \"body\": { \"model\": \"models/model-best\" }\r\n  },\r\n  \"template\": \"\",\r\n  \"label_mapping\": {},\r\n  \"text\": \"Example Text\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy Problem/Question\r\n---\r\nI suppose this is the request which is being send to Django to create a model instance which is used to communicate with my costum rest api.\r\nSomehow, when calling my api using doccano, the received json does only inlcude `{ \"model\": \"models/model-best\" }`. Shouldn't `\"text\": \"Example Text\"` also be in there? What am I missing?\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.8\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Docker\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1248/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/826577361","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1307#issuecomment-826577361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1307","id":826577361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjU3NzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"maxtrem","id":51746838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzQ2ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51746838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem","html_url":"https://github.com/maxtrem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxtrem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-26T07:22:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T07:22:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the answer! \r\nRight now I'm using the docker image, so editing is a bit difficult.
