Since I'm not sure it's clearly documented anywhere (I couldn't find it...), I'll document it here.  (Actually, there is a short video under \"Add members for collaborative work\" on the \"Welcome to Doccano\" page.)\r\n\r\nLog in under the account that created the project.  If you're not already on the project page, click on \"Projects\", and then click on the project that you want to add users to.  (The URL will be s.t. like \"<host>/projects/1/settings\", where the number will vary according to the number of projects you have.)  At this point you should be on a page entitled \"Welcome to Doccano!\", with the selected project, and offer to import a dataset.  Down the left-hand side of the page are several other choices, including \"Home\", \"Dataset\", and crucially \"Members\".  Click on \"Members\".  This will show already added members (= users), but click on the button labeled \"Add\", which brings up a dialog box \"Add member\".  Start typing into the \"User Search APIs\" field the name of someone who's already been added to the overall list of users, or click the down arrow on the right.  Once you have a user's name, you also need to assign a \"Role\" to them, for which there are three choices: \"Project Admin\", \"Annotator\" and \"Annotation Approver.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/838851637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcswell2001","id":83593186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTkzMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83593186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001","html_url":"https://github.com/mcswell2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4729595169,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDcyOTU5NTE2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4729595169","actor":{"login":"mcswell2001","id":83593186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTkzMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83593186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001","html_url":"https://github.com/mcswell2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-11T17:15:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
