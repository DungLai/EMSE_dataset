thanks for your advice. We had a discussion about your request and I will share it with you. \r\n\r\n* So is there a consensus on the format of the JSON file? \r\n  * Yes, we want to support the JSON file. \r\n\r\n* Also, is the separate radio button an acceptable way to implement this functionality in the UI, or would we want to auto-detect based on file extension? \r\n  * The radio button is a great idea, we will accept it.\r\n\r\n* Finally, if the user uploads a zip or tar file should it be expected that the archive contains a single file and if so, what is the format of that file, CSV, JSON, both?\r\n  * Right now, we want to support the JSON file first. After we finish the JSON support part, we can open a new issue to talk about supporting the zip or tar file. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* As for the JSON format. You mentioned JSON format such as:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    \"Document 1 text\",\r\n    \"Document 2 text\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThis format is pretty the same with the txt format file. In such case, we recommend you use the txt format to upload your file. And in order to make full use of JSON format, we set the JSON format like `demo1.json` below:\r\n```\r\n{'text': 'this is the first text'}\r\n{'text': 'this is the second text'}\r\n```\r\nThe key should be set as `text`, and the value is the document we want to annotate. The reason why we set this format is that we want to support the #11 Import labeled dataset in the future. In such case, we can import JSON like `demo2.json` below:\r\n```\r\n{'text': 'this is the first text', 'label': xxxx }\r\n{'text': 'this is the second text', 'label', xxxx}\r\n```\r\nThe label format will be different regarding the project/task. But first we want to support the JSON format like `demo1.json`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe JSON file should work in three project/task (sequence labeling, document classification, sequence to sequence). But for the sequence labeling task, the document is supposed contain no newline. Becasue this will cause the UI changed in the sequence labeling anotation page. For other two tasks, it is ok that the document contains newline. \r\n\r\nI upload two demo json file for test, feel free to use it.\r\n[test_json_NER.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fhr3xBmfdUbtLko9Prd-ZtsUQl6SWERA)\r\n[test_json_NER_newline.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FdSrY_GADnGiA-wPZnpleZIntkkqQyYo)\r\n\r\nIf you have any question, let me know

Thanks for your advice. Outputting spacy JSON format is a good idea, we also want to support this feature. But as the input JSON format, we want to make it as simple as possible to make sure processing one line each time. And if we use the totally same spacy JSON format, we have to change the backend model, which is not we want. \r\n\r\nBecause our JSON format is very simple, it is easy to write a script to convert spacy JSON annotated file to our format. And after annotating the file in doccano, you can download the spacy JSON format data. This will become a closed cycle. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10768193/48526715-033b7200-e8cc-11e8-9422-b4bd27979e84.png)\r\n\r\nAs for the convert script, you implement by yourself and PR to us. If there is no such convert script after we complete the JSON support feature, we will offer such a script. #15
