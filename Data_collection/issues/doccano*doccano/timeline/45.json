@serzh, thanks for your patience. We have implemented the JSON export feature from front to end. Could you change your code accordingly? \r\nIn order to follow a good GitHub collaboration workflow, there are some tips might be helpful. \r\n\r\nUsually, we use a new branch for feature development. But you developed directly on the master branch. This will cause confilct when you want to merge latest version to your forked repo. \r\n\r\nIn order to rebase your forked repo (master branch) to the latest version of doccano. You should make a copy of your code, where the code related with metadata feature. \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Add upstream\r\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano\r\n\r\n# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,\r\ngit fetch upstream\r\n\r\n# Make sure that you're on your master branch:\r\ngit checkout master\r\n\r\n# Rewrite your master branch to make  your local doccano be the same with upstream/master \r\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\r\n\r\n# Make your forked repo same as the upstream\r\ngit push -f origin master\r\n```\r\n`git reset --hard upstream/master` will make your local version totally same with doccano master branch and delete the work you have committed. So, please make a copy before running the `git reset --hard upstream/master`.  \r\n\r\nAfter you update your local master and origin master same with the upstream master, you can name a new branch like: `git checkout -b feature/metadata`. \r\n\r\nThen you could rewrite the metadata feature code in the `feature/metadata` branch. Here you will use the copied code before running `git reset --hard upstream/master`. \r\n\r\nAs for the commit message, it would be great to add an issue prefix. For example, `git commit -m 'iss17: support for uploading json file'`. This is not mandatory, just for an explicit statement.\r\n\r\nAfter you finish the development, you can run `git push origin feature/metadata` and make a PR from `serzh:feature/metadata` to `chakki-works:master`. \r\n\r\nYou can check the detail here [How to Contribute to Doccano Project](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/wiki/How-to-Contribute-to-Doccano-Project)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask us.

PR introducec a concept of metadata: any additional keys or columns in the imported file that are preserved and exported in the metadata key or column on export. The main use-case is to be able to match exported data with your existing corpus by providing `external_id` in the imported file, although there are other use-cases. Corresponding issue #45 .\r\n\r\nHere are some comments about this PR:\r\n1. **CSV vs TXT**\r\nIt is not clear for me why we have csv format called a txt format. It is clear that txt format that is described on the \"Import\" page is a subset of the csv. Why don't call it just CSV? That is what I have done. And to preserver previous behaviour I have made the CSV header and text column in it required, unless it is one-column csv (previous txt format). If it is one-column csv it is assumed that the only column is the text column.\r\n\r\n2. **Importing big files**\r\nIn the previous implementation the whole file was read into memory on the import phase. That may cause memory problems with really big files. To mitigate this issue I have made processing of this files to use generators and to use batched creation of the `Document` rows in database. I have made batch size to be configured by the `IMPORT_BATCH_SIZE` setting.\r\n\r\n3. **Error handling** \r\nThere was several places in the code where caught exceptions was not logged anywhere. To fix this I have added logging of them. Also I have added `django.contrib.messages` facilities to the `admin_base` template to show application level errors. For now it is used only for import feature, but I think that there are many other places where it will be appropriate.\r\n\r\n4. **`Project` polymorphism based on its type** (not done)\r\nWe have 3 project types: document classification, sequence labeling and seq2seq. All of this types are represented as a single `Project` class with lots of `if-else`s on project type. It will be more better to use inheritance and `proxy` model to represent these polymorphic relations. It will be easier to extend, write and reason about.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"DSLituiev","id":8426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MjYyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev","html_url":"https://github.com/DSLituiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DSLituiev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T00:17:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T00:17:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/57","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/57/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/57/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/57/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/57","id":395422353,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQxODgwMzQ5","number":57,"title":"Read
