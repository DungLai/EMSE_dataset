created a project in Doccano, and I am able to do annotations in it, but when I add other users, they can't see the project, and therefore cannot do annotations in it.  This appears to be issue #452 (and similarly #2), but reading that closed issue did not solve my problem.\r\n\r\n    OS  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.9\r\n    Python version 3.6.8  \r\n    When did you install  21 Apr 2021\r\n    How did you install  [Not sure how to answer this question]\r\n\r\nI'll attach some screen shots, but here's the gist.  Under \"Django administration\" (https://<host>/admin/api/sequencelabelingproject/1/change/), the project (it's a Sequence labeling project) shows 4 users, including the one who can't see the project.  \r\n![Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117848028-e3912480-b250-11eb-9375-aabb8760b8af.png)\r\n\r\nUnder 'Groups' (https://<host>/admin/auth/group/), I created a group 'AllPermissions', which has all the permissions under the heading of \"Chosen permissions.\"  \r\n![Group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117847798-b04e9580-b250-11eb-9fd5-1d53f7862b3b.png)\r\n\r\nUnder 'Users',  and this user in particular (https://<host>/admin/auth/user/3/change/), the user is listed as \"Active\" and belonging to the \"AllPermissions\" group under the \"Chosen groups\" heading.  (I actually want to limit this user's permissions, but I gave them all permissions for purposes of debugging.)  No separate permissions are listed under \"Chosen user permissions\".  (I also tried adding all permissions here, as well as by the chosen group, but that didn't help.)\r\n![User](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117848056-ea1f9c00-b250-11eb-9841-1d0c13a8acc4.png)\r\n\r\nWhen this user logs in and clicks on the Projects button, nothing happens; no projects are listed.  The user can create a new project, but cannot log into or even see an existing project.\r\n![AddProject](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117846729-b1cb8e00-b24f-11eb-8d6c-1571bf9b7533.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4967982550,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ5Njc5ODI1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/4967982550","actor":{"login":"zanussbaum","id":33707069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzA3MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33707069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum","html_url":"https://github.com/zanussbaum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9bf6c523470739d0e43c16b758fefac96f1fceb6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zanussbaum/doccano/commits/9bf6c523470739d0e43c16b758fefac96f1fceb6","created_at":"2021-07-01T20:04:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"zanussbaum","id":33707069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzA3MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33707069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum","html_url":"https://github.com/zanussbaum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanussbaum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T05:13:10Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T05:13:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/1432","id":935422822,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjgyMzQwNjk0","number":1432,"title":"Fixing

uploading datasets, the code uses a `bulk_create` to upload\r\nExamples and Labels.

However, [Django doesn't enforce\r\nthe list order when calling filter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7163640/what-is-the-default-order-of-a-list-returned-from-a-django-filter-call) unless ordering is specified. The previous behavior mismatched labels\r\nand examples.

This fix enforces that the data is returned in the order\r\nit was inserted so that the data, label pair is as expected. This was slightly hard to detect as the ordering returned from Postgres/Django was variable and would sometimes return the expected results but other times not.
