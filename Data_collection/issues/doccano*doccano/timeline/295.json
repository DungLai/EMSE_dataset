can download JSONL file with markup information but unfortunately, there is some ids used: user id, label id. But there is no convenient way to receive information about user name from user id, label name from label id. But you are adding texts in the result even though there is text id in the result file.\r\nMaybe, it would be more useful to return in JSONL file with markup information only ids but add an opportunity to download another file with information about such connections: \r\nuser id --> user name (for users which participated in a markup of the project)\r\nlabel id --> label name\r\ntext id --> text\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/534067475","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/295#issuecomment-534067475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/295","id":534067475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDA2NzQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"dcram","id":12859843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU5ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12859843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram","html_url":"https://github.com/dcram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcram/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-23T11:57:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T11:57:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @eric-czech thanks, here is the same as dict:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> docker exec -i doccano /bin/bash - << EOF\r\n> python -c '\r\n> import sqlite3\r\n> conn = sqlite3.connect(\"app/db.sqlite3\")\r\n> # Must replace your project_id here (e.g. from url in web app)\r\n> rows = conn.execute(\"SELECT id, text FROM api_label WHERE project_id = 5;\").fetchall()\r\n> print({k: v for k,v in rows})\r\n> '\r\n> EOF\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Do not forget to adjust the project id :)\r\n\r\nVery nice workaround.
