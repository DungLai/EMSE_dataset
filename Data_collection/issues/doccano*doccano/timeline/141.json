@icoxfog417 This feature will be very useful for one of my upcoming projects, so I'd like to start working on implementing it.\r\n\r\nHere are my initial thoughts, please let me know what you think so that we're aligned on how to best build this feature.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of adding a new button next to the file upload button to trigger the cloud upload feature:\r\n\r\n![Mock-up of cloud upload workflow 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/57858898-e8d14b00-77bf-11e9-9ffb-4bcad2cf73b1.png)\r\n\r\nThis button can open a modal that lets the user input all the data required to connect to the cloud storage via [Apache Libcloud](https://github.com/apache/libcloud):\r\n\r\n![Mock-up of cloud upload workflow 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/57858909-ee2e9580-77bf-11e9-8b67-2b9772ca33c8.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the upload button, the form is sent to the TextUploadAPI. In this request, there will be no file present so the backend API checks for that. If the file is not present, the API opens the cloud file as a stream and passes it to the parser. The rest of the code doesn't have to change. Something along these lines:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass TextUploadAPI(APIView):\r\n  # ... the code before this point doesn't have to change\r\n  def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        project = get_object_or_404(Project, pk=self.kwargs['project_id'])\r\n\r\n        if 'file' in request.data:\r\n            data = request.data['file']\r\n        else:\r\n            libcloud_client = ... # code to unpack libcloud fields here and create client\r\n            data = ... # code to open file from cloud storage as stream here\r\n\r\n        parser = self.select_parser(request.data['format'])\r\n        data = parser.parse(data)\r\n        # ... the rest of the code below this point doesn't have to change\r\n\r\n# instead of the if-statement, we could also make a new API that handles only cloud upload and\r\n# move the shared code from the file upload API into utility functions so they can be re-used\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne benefit of the approach of using Apache Libcloud is that the cloud upload piece is completely decoupled from the rest of the Django configuration so for each upload the user could select a different cloud storage, e.g. import one set of data from AWS S3 and another from Google Cloud Storage, without having to change anything about the server configuration: all the cloud connection information is passed from the client.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the modal could also be extended to include a full browser of the cloud storage to provide a nice file explorer like functionality (e.g. using [django-cloud-browser](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/django-cloud-browser)) but this will require a lot more effort (e.g. that project doesn't support Azure Storage currently which is a requirement for me). I believe the approach with the modal proposed here may provide a nice first-step/MVP to enable the cloud-based file import workflow and we can do improvements on top of this base later.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and looking forward to hearing your thoughts soon!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/493079845/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"c-w","id":1086421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w","html_url":"https://github.com/c-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2346552077,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NjU1MjA3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2346552077","actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346552078,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDY1NTIwNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2346552078","actor":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346552082,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NjU1MjA4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2346552082","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2346552084,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDY1NTIwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2346552084","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=

https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/141 it was discussed to enable the user to upload data directly from cloud storage. This feature speeds up the annotation workflow by no longer requiring the user to download all data files to their machine and also enables data import into doccano in higher compliance environments where users may not be allowed to download data files to their machine.\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements the data import from cloud by integrating:\r\n\r\n- [libcloud storage](https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage/index.html) to have a single SDK in the import API to interact with a wide range of cloud storage systems such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc.\r\n\r\n- [django-cloud-browser](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/django-cloud-browser) to enable the user to navigate the cloud storage interactively and select which file to upload. Note that the cloud browser uses libcloud under the hood so it supports the exact same set of cloud storages as the import API.\r\n\r\nThe animation below shows the cloud upload experience:\r\n\r\n![Animation showing data import from cloud storage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1086421/58346762-e3ac7580-7e29-11e9-8995-432020df282f.gif)\r\n\r\nThe cloud upload feature is functionally complete but the default UI of django-cloud-browser is fairly basic. I'd be very happy to take guidance on how to improve the CSS to make it more aligned with doccano, e.g. is there a UI style-guide for doccano?\r\n\r\nResolves
