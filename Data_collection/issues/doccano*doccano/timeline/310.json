System information\r\n- Windows 10\r\n- Python Version: 3.6 \r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nHi, I think it should be possible to indicate at which document we want to resume annotation. For example, I have a dataset of several thousands articles and cannot annotate them all at once, and when I quit Doccano then come back it just brings me on the first document.\r\n\r\nHence I think that either Doccano should automatically restart on the last document you annotated, or that is should allow us to indicate a number at which we want to start.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/261/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
