It signals that the Doccano team isn't testing these migrations with live data and protecting for upgrades. Especially on a minor version bump!\r\n\r\nWhether or not these migration files can be fixed for the future, it would be VERY helpful to know that future upgrades don't just delete all existing data. Or to prepare accordingly.\r\n\r\nCan we get an acknowledgment on this?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Apologies if my original language was a bit harsh, I understand the constraints of the project and greatly appreciate the work done thus far, and this isn't game-breaking for us. That being said, resolving the migration process in future model changes would be super helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/957876844/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ljades","id":3341493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDE0OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3341493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades","html_url":"https://github.com/ljades","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljades/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5607143632,"node_id":"LE_lADOB-j9wM42NqzszwAAAAFONjjQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/5607143632","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-12T02:42:15Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
