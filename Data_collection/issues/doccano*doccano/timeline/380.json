Issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/380\r\nhttps://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/775\r\n\r\nHi, \r\n\r\nI am trying to deploy docker-compose.prod such that the frontend server has a new base URI. I have a reverse proxy setup with nginx such that access to XYZ.com/doccano/ gets redirected to localhost:[port for doccano]. \r\n\r\nA simple proxy_pass does not work because the relative URLs for nuxt.js files and image files remains to be set at the root URL. In development, I was able to fix this by setting the [router base property](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-router/#base):\r\n```\r\n  2 export default {\r\n  3   mode: 'spa',\r\n  4   /*\r\n  5   ** Headers of the page\r\n  6   */\r\n  7   router: {\r\n  8     base: '/doccano/'\r\n  9   }\r\n```\r\n```\r\nsysadmin@XXX:~$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nfrontend_1  | ℹ Listening on: http://172.21.0.3:3000/doccano/\r\n```\r\nHowever, it seems that this setting does not work for the production environment. Any help regarding base URI setup and difference between deployment in development and production are greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.6\r\n*   When you install doccano: August 24\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): git
