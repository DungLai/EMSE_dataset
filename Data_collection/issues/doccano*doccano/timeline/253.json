this PR, I will implement frontend using Nuxt.js and Vuetify and add testing using Jest.\r\n\r\nThere are three main reasons for this.\r\n\r\nFirst, as I wrote in [the project](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/projects/3) and [feature ideas](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/projects/2), I think supporting mobile web is important because a lot of people in the world don't have their own personal computer but probably they have a smartphone. If doccano supports mobile web, it will become easier to utilize crowdsourcing.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think we need to decrease `hacktivation energy` to attract more developers and speed up development. According to \"[Producing open source software](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#starting-from-what-you-have)\", hacktivation energy means the amount of energy a newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back. The lower a project's hacktivation energy, the better. For now, doccano's frontend code is somewhat complicated so hacktivation energy is high. That's why I adopt Nuxt.js and Vuetify to lower the energy.\r\n\r\nFinally, we need test cases for frontend code. As you know, doccano have good test codes for backend code. Its coverage is over 90%. In contrast, there is no test case for frontend code. In this situation, we can't measure PR quality and I think it causes high hacktivation energy. That's why I decided to introduce Jest as a testing framework and atomic design as a component design principle.\r\n\r\nThe following images are new frontend under development:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/63267777-b6a71c00-c2cd-11e9-9829-363b46c35812.png)\r\n\r\nNew sequence labeling screen. We can always see label text. This change will solve https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/253.\r\n\r\nI decided to move options to the right sidebar. It simplifies the main content:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/63268280-c83cf380-c2ce-11e9-93d2-f0fe33acb5c4.png)\r\n\r\nMobile screen:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/63268346-f3bfde00-c2ce-11e9-89ac-de13869094e3.png)\r\n\r\nUser management. It will support RBAC.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/63268453-27026d00-c2cf-11e9-9384-5b1ab887ae9b.png)\r\n\r\nLabel list.
