for my late reply. I would suggest to implement the feature in two substeps.\r\n\r\n1. the minimum requirement would be that you can capture URIs to link to the corresponding entity in an ontology. In the first step, this could be done by simply adding the url by hand or by copy and past. In the user interface there should simply be a corresponding field. It must be possible to enter more than one URI. For example, in a current project I am working on it is a requirement per entity to reference a private ontology and if possible a public ontology. The question now is how best to integrate the identifier into the Doccano Jsonl format? One suggestion would be to extend the labels as follows:\r\n```json\r\n{\"text\": \"Douglas Adams\", \"lables\": [{0, 13, \"person\", \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42\"}]}\r\n```\r\nOther suggestion? I think implementing this part of the feature is possible with relatively little effort and would add tremendous value. I'm sure there are others than me doing NEL tasks :wink:\r\n\r\n2. in the second part you could implement the upload and use of a knowledge base. I would suggest that the user can upload his knowledge base as a [NIF](https://github.com/dice-group/gerbil/wiki/NIF) file. This is supported by many Named Entity Linking Engines like [dbpedia-spotlight](https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/). Now such an existing named entity linking engine could be used to automatically make suggestions to the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/981350874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rogerwaldvogel","id":7993771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel","html_url":"https://github.com/rogerwaldvogel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogerwaldvogel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/981383756","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1545#issuecomment-981383756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1545","id":981383756,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-j9wM46frpM","user":{"login":"ghontolux","id":87199298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTk5Mjk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87199298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux","html_url":"https://github.com/ghontolux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghontolux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T08:12:08Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T08:12:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You are right.
