I wrote something similar for myself and I would love to contribute with PR :) however, I am not sure how to handle mislabeled tokens. Namely, what if a token was marked only partially? For my own purposes, I print out the mislabeled token, which is a warning to a script's user, and drop the token annotation but in a production this is not a way to go. \r\n\r\nThe other things is, what should be \"non-entity\" token?  `'O'` ? Then we should prevent user from adding such label which might be misleading for some people. Or maybe we should create the form where user itself can provide the token? Or leave it blank?\r\n\r\nI think this feature request is great but we should agree how exactly tackle this :smile: I would love to read your suggestions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/547856329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"prokotg","id":19536019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTM2MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19536019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg","html_url":"https://github.com/prokotg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prokotg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/558438078","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/386#issuecomment-558438078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/386","id":558438078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODQzODA3OA==","user":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T03:04:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T03:04:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have a plan to create a new Python package named `doccano-transformer`.\r\nIt will transform annotated documents into other formats such as https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/362, https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/454 and so on.

I'd like to import a dataset simply as .txt (in which each line is a sentence):\r\n\r\n```   \r\nGeorge Washington went to Washington.\r\nSam Houston stayed home.\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and export it (after annotating) as follows, also in a .txt:\r\n```   \r\nGeorge B-PER\r\nWashington I-PER\r\nwent O\r\nto O\r\nWashington B-LOC\r\n\r\nSam B-PER\r\nHouston I-PER\r\nstayed O\r\nhome O\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, export in the well-known IOB annotation format. So for this, Doccano should automatically know that if an annotated entity comprises more than 1 token should be annotated with B (beginning) and I (inside) labels. Also, there are more sophisticated annotation schemes besides IOB, such as BIOES. Here, S (single) is used to represent a chunk containing a single token. The BIOES annotation scheme would result in the following:\r\n\r\n```   \r\nGeorge B-PER\r\nWashington E-PER\r\nwent O\r\nto O\r\nWashington S-LOC\r\n\r\nSam B-PER\r\nHouston E-PER\r\nstayed O\r\nhome O\r\n```\r\nIt would be awesome if I could export annotated datasets in the IOB or BIOES (or other) formats. Many state-of-the-art libraries for NER require token-level annotation in order to train models (Flair from Zalando, Transformers from HuggingFace,...).
