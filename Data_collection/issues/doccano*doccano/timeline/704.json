When we use `docker-compose.dev.yml`, it mainly run two servers: frontend and backend API. When we submit username and password in the frontend, it is processed in the backend API. In other words, the two servers are communicating. At that time, the backend API restricts cross-origin HTTP requests for security reasons. In the initial settings, the backend allows only port `3000`. That's why you could not login.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use ports other than `3000`, you need to add `127.0.0.1:8999` to `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/doccano/doccano/blob/c31dd82c31f38f0398b2699d3303b4d676201106/app/app/settings.py#L314-L318\r\n\r\nOr, you can use `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL=True` to allow any access.\r\n- [django-cors-headers](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers#configuration)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/616276382/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/616276717","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/704#issuecomment-616276717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/704","id":616276717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjI3NjcxNw==","user":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T02:35:28Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T02:35:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The odd thing is that the login screen I get using \"docker-compose\" looks very different from the screen I get when using docker.\r\n\r\nDocker version is older version.
