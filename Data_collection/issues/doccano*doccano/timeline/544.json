the annotation of overlapping entities\r\n---------\r\nPlease support overlapping entities in biomedical NLP this is quite common and would make the library a lot more useful. Would be good to understand what would need to change to implement this feature.

Nested mode\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/09e01d9152cad820238acbc52f4be3fc.gif)\r\n\r\nOf course, you are able to annotate text without using nested mode.\r\n\r\n## Relation Labeling\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/79b6c31898c009629d22adc1362a2858.png)\r\n\r\n## RTL Language\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/02cc980a61ede7196029a2d84311ecd5.gif)\r\n\r\nIn the case of mixed RTL and LTR Language:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/bf2d0293562b805072955a4ec913a46f.gif)\r\n\r\n## Grapheme mode\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, there is not always a one-to-one relationship between string characters and what a user would call a separate visual \"letter\". Some symbols are represented by several characters. This can cause issues when you annotate the part of the text in sequence labeling.\r\n\r\nFor example, emoji characters like \"🌷\",\"🎁\",\"💩\",\"😜\" and \"👍\" are represented by two JavaScript characters each (high surrogate and low surrogate). That is,\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"🌷\".length == 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe combined emoji is even longer:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"🏳️‍🌈\".length == 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, If your text includes such characters, the start/end offset indicates codepoint offset which is different from a \"visual offset\".\r\n\r\nSo, I implemented the \"Grapheme mode\" which counts the character per grapheme cluster. As an example, let's say you select the text as follows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6737785/136881000-bed55db1-4407-4511-a4be-89692e2158c3.png)\r\n\r\nWith the grapheme mode, the offset is `(1, 3)`. On the other hand, without the mode, the offset is `(4, 12)` because it counts the codepoints.\r\n\r\n## Large Document\r\n\r\nI introduced the virtual rendering system to handle a large document.
