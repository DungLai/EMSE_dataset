@Hironsan , it seems that the issue is back again: the filter option as for now works the next way: option 'ALL' shows all files as expected, the option 'Done' shows all files were any labels are present and the option 'Undone' shows all files that do not feature any label. What do I expect: the option 'Done' show files that are 'Checked', the option 'Undone' shows all files that still need to be further labeled. All this should work regardless of actual label availability since not all dataset documents necessarily feature NE that are labeled in a project and not all documents that have a few labeled NE are already finalized. In our case, it is quite an issue since we do not start from scratch but check labeling that was performed before automatically so all documents do contain labels but still need to be checked for consistency. We are using the latest Docker build and experience the same issue both in the Azure cloud instance that is used for collaborative workflow and in the local Ubuntu 18.04 server that was available for testing. Please let me know what additional info may be useful.
