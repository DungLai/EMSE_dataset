A very simple way of adding some pseudo-random document order could be to make the pagination wrap-around (so we extend `LimitOffsetPagination.get_offset` and set `offset = offset % count`) and then start each user at a different starting offset. This doesn't randomize the document order entirely, but for large collections of documents may still work towards reducing annotation fatigue since not every user will see the first documents in the corpus when they start annotating.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we may be able to get stable/repeatable per-user randomization using an approach like this:\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/app/server/api.py
