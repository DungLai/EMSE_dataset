I already tried the Docker way but I failed. This is why I wanted to give it a go with my own server. In any case, I retried again but I'm afraid I'm still stuck. \r\n\r\nSee, the instructions in Usage don't say anything about deploying doccano in production but in a development server.  \r\n\r\nFirst attempt to run doccano from my production server using the Usage part as a guide:\r\n```\r\n# From Usage\r\ngit clone https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano.git\r\ncd doccano\r\ndocker pull chakkiworks/doccano\r\ndocker run -d --rm --name doccano \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_USERNAME=admin\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_PASSWORD=password\" \\\r\n  -p 8000:8000 chakkiworks/doccano\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# From FAQ\r\ndocker run -d --name doccano -p 8000:80 chakkiworks/doccano\r\ndocker exec doccano tools/create-admin.sh \"admin\" \"admin@example.com\" \"password\"\r\ndocker stop doccano\r\ndocker start doccano \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter following -separately- both instructions  I then go to `http://111.222.333.444:8000/login` and it just hangs out.  Both [Usage](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano#usage) and [FAQ](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) instructions don't say anything about  `Debug = False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-ip-address']` or `SECRET KEY` when deploying in production . \r\n\r\nSo I enter the running container(`docker exec -it -u 0 container-ID bash`)  to edit the settings.py to make it more production-wise (i.e. `Debug = False`,   `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['my-ip-address]`, `SECRET_KEY='my-secret-key' ). Then I exit the container, stop it it and then start it again. I go to `http://111.222.333.444:8000/login` and, again, it just hangs out.  \r\n\r\nAm I missing something very obvious? What would be the correct steps to run Doccano in a production server? I have read bits from here and there (in the [issues](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues) section) but still can't figure it out. Please feel free to correct me. I'm not very familiar with docker.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

For a reason I have yet to understand using my host's port 8000 (Django's development server default port) wasn't working.  \r\n```\r\ndocker run -d --rm --name doccano \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_USERNAME=admin\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_EMAIL=my@email.com\" \\\r\n  -e \"ADMIN_PASSWORD=password\" \\\r\n  -e \"DEBUG=False\" \\\r\n  -e \"SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey\" \\\r\n  -p 80:8000 doccano:myrebuilt\r\n```\r\nThanks again, @c-w. I hope my issue helps a future reader.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/524570060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roperi","id":9901508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MDE1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9901508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi","html_url":"https://github.com/roperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2581556041,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU4MTU1NjA0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2581556041","actor":{"login":"roperi","id":9901508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MDE1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9901508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi","html_url":"https://github.com/roperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roperi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-24T18:05:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2581556042,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU4MTU1NjA0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2581556042","actor":{"login":"c-w","id":1086421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w","html_url":"https://github.com/c-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-24T18:05:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2581556043,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1ODE1NTYwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/events/2581556043","actor":{"login":"c-w","id":1086421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w","html_url":"https://github.com/c-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-24T18:05:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/811176301","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/349#issuecomment-811176301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/349","id":811176301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTE3NjMwMQ==","user":{"login":"hamzalagrari","id":81393590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzkzNTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.c
