I have never worked with pgsql, but that format for the credentials doesn't appear to be correct from what I can find in the pgsql docs. Intuitively, I wouldn't suspect that the format is correct either (I have never seen the `@` as part of the username before, personally).\r\n\r\nIf I use the template, but modify that variable to be:\r\n```json\r\n\"databaseUserCredentials\": \"[concat(uriComponent(parameters('adminUserName')), ':', uriComponent(parameters('adminPassword')))]\",\r\n```\r\nI no longer get the error above. I just see the following over and over:\r\n```\r\nDatabase unavailable on attempt 19/60: FATAL:  Invalid Username specified. Please check the Username and retry connection. The Username should be in <username@hostname> format.\r\n```\r\nI am not sure how to proceed from here because I am not sure how I can investigate what is being passed as the connection info.
