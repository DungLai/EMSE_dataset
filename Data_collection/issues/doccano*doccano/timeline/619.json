labels\r\n* So here what I want now is, when the API call finishes how can I replace my old uploaded data with the new returned data without re-uploading the data itself. Which means I need to store the labeled file under the same project replacing the old one(unlabeled one).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/599952855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sharmila-polamuri","id":28034607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDM0NjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28034607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri","html_url":"https://github.com/sharmila-polamuri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharmila-polamuri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/600527163","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/619#issuecomment-600527163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/619","id":600527163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDUyNzE2Mw==","user":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T09:56:25Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T09:56:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can annotate the data directly by API.
