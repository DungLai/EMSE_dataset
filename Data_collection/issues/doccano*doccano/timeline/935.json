I don't think that \"General Users\" should be a good name to someone that is able to create projects. I guess this is a admin feature.\r\n\r\nMaybe the actual names are easily to think: \r\nAdmins -> Admins\r\nApprovers -> Staff and what you called General Users (Maybe third party users..)\r\nAnnotators -> what you called Temporary Users\r\n\r\nAnd the idea to have users been created inside Doccano frontend are awesome. I put a question recently to ask about it. #930 \r\nI didn't want to discuss, but I disagree that just because you prioritized Annotation feature, that this shouldn't be important. If a production environment be controlled by a consulting enterprise, you would need a admin to create users. If there is 1000 users and so on, this would be a big issue to have only admin creating it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/665695250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"br-dr3","id":42852567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUyNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42852567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3","html_url":"https://github.com/br-dr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/br-dr3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/877893160","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/935#issuecomment-877893160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/935","id":877893160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Nzg5MzE2MA==","user":{"login":"youichiro","id":20487308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDg3MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20487308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro","html_url":"https://github.com/youichiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youichiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-12T00:47:00Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T04:04:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm
