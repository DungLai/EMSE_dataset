I can't really tell why its not working for you, but you could check if the right format arrives at the TextDownloadView.\r\nYou can print the format in the import_export.py after line 133. If it doesn't print jsonl in your terminal (where you start the server) then the wrong format parameter arrives at the view. Line 146 shows the check for the type parameter where the labels are painted. Would be interesting if that's the case. \r\nSry, but that's my only suggestion for the problem rn.

I have used both export options and the outputs are the same. I have tried on mac and PC - the same. I have installed fresh and up-to-date and still the same issue. What am i missing here? I have seen this was a previous issue, but no answer apart from this has been solved. I am using windows 10 and python 3.9.0\r\n\r\nthanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/comments/813980866","html_url":"https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1291#issuecomment-813980866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1291","id":813980866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzk4MDg2Ng==","user":{"login":"walsripe","id":26459647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDU5NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26459647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe","html_url":"https://github.com/walsripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walsripe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T09:38:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T10:09:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"BTW.
