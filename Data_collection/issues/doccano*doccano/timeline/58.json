pull request implements a small improvement to the labeling view: the labeling view now remembers the current page by syncing the current query offset to the URL fragment.\r\n\r\nThis enables \"deep linking\" where a user who's doing a labeling session could bookmark the current page and later resume work from where they stopped. See also https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/issues/58.\r\n\r\nIdeally the feature would use [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) instead of the custom fragment manipulation, but that would be
