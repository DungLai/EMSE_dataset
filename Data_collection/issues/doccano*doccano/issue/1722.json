What specific solution would you like? -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, imported files are stored locally on the server. This means that as the number of files increases, the server storage must be expanded. Generally speaking, server storage is expensive, so some storage services are often used.\r\n\r\nIn doccano, we use [django-drf-filepond](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/django-drf-filepond) as a back-end implementation for [filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/) file upload library. Fortunately, it supports the remote upload feature. So we should be able to support the feature.\r\n\r\n- [Remote storage of filepond uploads via django-storages](https://django-drf-filepond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#remote-storage-of-filepond-uploads-via-django-storages)\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/1684, I divided `settings.py` into multiple files. So we can set up the settings of the remote storage by creating a new setting file. For example, the following is the one for AWS S3 setting(`aws.py`):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nDJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_STORAGES_BACKEND = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'\r\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')\r\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')\r\nAWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'\r\nAWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'filepond-uploads'\r\nAWS_DEFAULT_ACL = 'private'\r\nAWS_BUCKET_ACL = 'private'\r\nAWS_AUTO_CREATE_BUCKET = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut some code in `data_import` app needs to be changed.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
