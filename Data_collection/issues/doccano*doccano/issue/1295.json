Unfortunately, a pull request trying to solve it, was never merged and apparently is outdated (https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/586). \r\nOver the time, I learned some more tools regarding authentification. The most promising I think is keycloak, as it's possible to use several systems behind it (ldap etc). Thus, my feature request is, if it would be possible to implement keycloak support into doccano? I found a [module for django](https://django-keycloak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and hope, that for a doccano expert it's not that complicated to implement.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1295/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
