I see some (non-understandable) facts about it.\r\n\r\n1. If I change \"All / Done / Undone\" filter, document's content is changed but `document index` doesn't.\r\n2. `document index` isn't updated even if it is totally incorrect: go to 5th document of an unannotated dataset, switch to \"Done\", you'll got: `5 of 0`.\r\n3. `document index` is cleared sometimes. But when? On browser quit?\r\n4. `total` part is updated during annotation but _sometimes_. And I don't understand at which moment, exactly. Is `total` updated for Bob if \"Done\" filter is turned of for Bob and Alice has been annotated a document at the moment?\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nHow is it supposed to work?\r\n\r\nThanks,.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/594/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
