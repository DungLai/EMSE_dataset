installing doccano and running it successfully a few times, I tried to change the password to an empty password.\r\nThis did not work, and even when I reset it to the default value it still doesn't work. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that may harm the correct flow of my doccano is that I downloaded another repo of doccano which I accidentally run on different ports simultaneously, this might have harmed the common databases.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, looking up all the existing similar issues in the repo issues pages did not solve my problem.\r\n\r\nI think that full removal of the doccano files could help, but I'm not sure which files should be removed, except for the obvious project files.\r\n\r\nWhen the server fires up i get this error msg:\r\npostgres_1  | 2020-11-29 11:10:57.015 UTC [1]
