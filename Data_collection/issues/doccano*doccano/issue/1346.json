(Despite changing the export format)\r\nSo I brought down the deployed to re-deploy but couldn't find the option that was previously available on the Github page. \r\nSo I used the Azure one-click deployment on the documentation page. It gets deployed but the site is unresponsive or doesn't load at all. \r\nAlso, the instructions mention to pull it using Docker and then deploy but it seems that whether or not I pull using Docker, the deployment is successful. \r\n\r\nI'm new to these processes. Can someone please help me? \r\n```bash\r\n# copy-paste the error message here\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Windows 10 \r\n*   Python Version Used: Didn't use Python. Used Docker. \r\n*   When you install doccano: It's unresponsive, too slow and failing to load.  \r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Azure one-click deployment in the documentation page. \r\n* Is the image that I pull into the Docker related to the Doccano I deploy in Azure because whether or not I use DOcker, I'm able to deploy using one-click deployment. If it's not related, how to deploy using Docker? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
