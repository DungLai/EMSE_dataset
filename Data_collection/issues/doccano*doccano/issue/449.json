As reported in #447, there was a security vulnerability in Tornado 5.0.2. But in fact, doccano is not using Tornado. The reason that Tornado was included in the dependency is I was trying to implement doccano using Tornado in [early commits](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/commit/97e426e1c09a76f0ec20eb658838e6a4a3b2c3d3). In the end, I decided to use Django instead of Tornado. \r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nRemove the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n* mixer\r\n* tornado\r\n\r\nActually, I want to manage dependencies with Pipenv, but this is another issue.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
