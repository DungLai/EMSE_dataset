This would save a considerable amount of time in organizing cases where you have multiple people annotating within the same project. Particularly when you are sharing labels\r\n\r\nThis is related to the annotation process, currently when sharing annotations, annotators need to scroll through all of the already annotated data to get to new items to label. This feature would allow them to find the next unlabeled item and get to work more quickly.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would also put a lock on any samples that are currently being edited by other labelers, so no two annotators are given the same annotation to work on as well.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
