You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g \"2.2\" or \"3.3\") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.\r\nFor more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for fixing this I converted the `version` parameter to `3` and it started running fine\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System:  Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS\r\n*   Python Version Used: Python 2.7.17\r\n*   Docker version: Docker version 19.03.6, build 369ce74a3c\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): docker-compose command mentioned in Readme\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
