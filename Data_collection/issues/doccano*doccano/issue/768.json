I want the annotator to change the labels labeled by project admin. To achieve this in the django admin page i add the following permissions \r\n```\r\napi | label | Can add label\r\napi | label | Can change label\r\napi | label | Can delete label\r\napi | label | Can view label\r\napi | document annotation | Can add document annotation\r\napi | document annotation | Can change document annotation\r\napi | document annotation | Can delete document annotation\r\napi | document annotation | Can view document annotation\r\n```\r\nafter this also annotator not able to change the label. In the backend i see the following error \r\n```\r\nForbidden: /v1/projects/82/docs/17425/annotations/1106\r\n[13/May/2020 05:00:30] \"DELETE /v1/projects/82/docs/17425/annotations/1106 HTTP/1.1\" 403 63\r\n```\r\nPlease suggest any idea about this problem to solve.\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
