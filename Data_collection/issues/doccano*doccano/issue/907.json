When I press on the link to redirected to the original home page, it still behaves as if I am no longer signed in. However when I put in: 127.0.0.1:3000/projects, it behaves as if I am still authenticated.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior would be the error page preserving the fact that I am still authenticated and when redirected, for the home page to have the header behave as if I am still authenticated, with the links to Projects and ability to Logout.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-07-19 23-03-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64808267/87895705-1cd37c00-ca14-11ea-810d-fbe0ebd78c4c.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-07-19 22-56-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64808267/87895350-2f00ea80-ca13-11ea-9b2f-d3abfbd63415.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.6.5\r\n*   When you install doccano: 7/22/2020\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): git clone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
