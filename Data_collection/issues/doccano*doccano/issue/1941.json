For example, when I am doing a check of dichotomous annotations, I would like to filter the data set to find out which labels are positive and which are negative, so that I can save time on the check. However, due to the lack of this function, I have to filter one by one from dataset, which wastes a lot of time and manpower.\r\n\r\nThanks for every contributor!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
