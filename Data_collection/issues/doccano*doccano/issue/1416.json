I can annotate and export the *whole* dataset as well. But whenever I try to export only the checked data, I always get an empty zip file of 22 bytes. There is no code to reproduce this. I am not sure if others are facing this issue as well. But I guess if you have some documents that are checked and annotated and some that are not checked because you want to annotate them later, then when you want to export only the checked documents you get an empty zip file.\r\n\r\nAny solution for this?\r\n\r\nI am the Project Admin and I am only one working. Everything is running from inside a container.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n*   Operating System: Docker on Windows 10\r\n*   Python Version Used: N/A\r\n*   When you install doccano: Today\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Docker\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1416/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
