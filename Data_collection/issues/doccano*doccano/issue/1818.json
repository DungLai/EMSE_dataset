This is a very manual workflow of creating multiple, near duplicate projects. Having the ability to duplicate or clone an existing project, and then make edits manually would be an improvement. Currently, the only option in Doccano is to create a new project from scratch and manually copy/paste the Guidelines and re-upload a labels file (or manually enter in the labels a second time).\r\n\r\n\r\nEnv: MacOS","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1818/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
