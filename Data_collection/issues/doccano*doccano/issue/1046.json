My issue is with uploading conll files. I tried a few datasets (https://github.com/juand-r/entity-recognition-datasets/blob/master/data/wikigold/CONLL-format/data/wikigold.conll.txt and https://deepai.org/dataset/conll-2003-english) but the error prompt comes back with \"The file could not be uploaded. Maybe invalid format. Please check available formats carefully.\" \r\nI also tried reducing the dataset to less than 100 sentences and also changed the file type to .conll but it still gives me the same error. Possible to point me in the right direction to upload these files?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: Python 3.8.5\r\n*   When you install doccano: 14th November\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): docker-compose \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
