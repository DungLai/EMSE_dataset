What specific solution would you like? -->\r\nHi, i want to start by thanking you moderators and the comunity for this great tool that allows every one to start a very complete tagging process with very few bash lines.\r\n\r\nWhile working with doccano we found that it can be useful to retrieve the **confirmation timestamp** for each example via the existing backend method _GET /projects/{project_id}/examples/{example_id}/states_. As an example you may need this if you have to build your own stats on the confirmation times.\r\n\r\n This info is already stored on the DB (**confirmed_at** in api_examplestate table) but it's filtered out when the _ExampleState_ is serialized to produce the json output.\r\n I'm already working on a simple solution and i would like to file a pull request, so if you have any advice it is kindly appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
