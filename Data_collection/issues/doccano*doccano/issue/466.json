The newest version actually solve this problem by showing the key-value pairs in the right side. Thus we could put some context in the right side as key-value pair. For example, when we annotate one wikipadia page, the key-value will contain \"wikipadia title\" ,\"url\" and something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the context is large text, it won't work...\r\n\r\nFor example, here is my annotation task, we annotate each sentence in a document into one type. And we used document classification. User annotate one sentence at a time. Actually, when you annotate one sentence you need to see the context sentence of the annoted sentence and even the whole document. Thus we have to parse the data like this.\r\n\r\nHere is one sentence when user see the annoated sentence, we connect the annoated sentence and the context string directly, separated by some delimiters(\"----------\"):\r\n```\r\nHowever, using the same path, I was able to load the file when I did getResourceAsStream().\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nquestion body:\r\nI was trying to load a file in a webapp, and I was getting a FileNotFound exception when I used FileInputStream. However, using the same path, I was able to load the file when I did getResourceAsStream(). What is the difference between the two methods, and why does one work while the other doesn't?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add an area below the area where the text need to be annoated to show the context? The content of this context area is determined by the \"context\" field in the data set for each annotated data point. It can be empty, so this area is hidden.\r\n\r\nI think this context is useful for other annotation. For example, when I annoatate the type of Stack Overflow answer post, the question post should be shown to make the annotator understand the answer context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
