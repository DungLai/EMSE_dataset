Everything works fine, but when a new user sign ups, email verification is not received. I believe I have to set up a email host configurations in `settings.py`. How do I set it up as the project has already been deployed? Is it in the `/env.list` file, or the AWS one-click automatically does this?\r\n\r\n```\r\n# necessary for email verification of new accounts\r\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = env.bool('EMAIL_USE_TLS', False)\r\nEMAIL_HOST = env('EMAIL_HOST', None)\r\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = env('EMAIL_HOST_USER', None)\r\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = env('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD', None)\r\nEMAIL_PORT = env.int('EMAIL_PORT', 587)\r\n```\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment. -->\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: AWS ubuntu\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.6\r\n*   When you install doccano: Mar 30, 2020\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): AWS one-click deployment\r\n\r\n---------\r\nAlso, when I deployed the project using docker-compose by pulling the github project, the project looks older and not as in demo http://doccano.herokuapp.com/.
