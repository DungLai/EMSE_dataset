Upon reloading, instead of getting document ID (24 for example) will get the corresponding document on the first page, in this case, 4. \r\nThis can be assessed with a print in store/documents.js, in the getDocumentList action, line 102, (console.log(payload)). \r\nI've been able to fix this by adding this.updateSearchOptions before this.getDocumentList in the BottomNavigator.vue. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this is of any help to you but it might so i'll leave it here.
