It is difficult to tell what the document is with the text of the document.","closed_by":{"login":"jinhojang6","id":41753422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzUzNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41753422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhojang6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhojang6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/327/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
