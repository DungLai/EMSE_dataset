The annoying part here is that, in order to go to the next document I need to go to the top right corner of my screen. This is tedious and slows down the manual validation of annotations. It's actually nicely visible when looking at the _Annotate the dataset_ video featured on the home-screen.\r\n\r\nQuestion here would be if it's possible to have a mechanism that does the acknowledgment _and goes on to the next document_ all within a _single action_. For example using a hot-key and (for mouse-users) a button.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\nA fresh clone and docker-compose using the `dev` configuration.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
