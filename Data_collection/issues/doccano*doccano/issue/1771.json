Create at least one label, and import a simple document with multiple contiguous newlines in the middle, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n{\"text\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\\n\\n\\n\\nconsectetur adipiscing elit.\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see normal behavior, select \"Lorem ipsum\" and label it. See the presence of the label name. \r\n\r\nTo see bug, select a section starting on a newline and label it. You shouldn't be able to see the label, just the underlines.\r\n\r\n--------- \r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Windows\r\n*  Just installed latest doccano release via docker according to instructions in GitHub README\r\n* I have tried two different Windows machines, with both Edge and Chrome browsers.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
