Most of the times when I click the button \"Download\" (in both situations: CSV or JSONL) it appears that it's loading but then nothing happens. My data isn't downloaded.\r\n\r\nIt only happens once in many attempts that the labeled data is actualy downloaded. I need to be very lucky and keep trying (almost like playing the lottery) to be able to download my data. My operating system is Windows 10. \r\n\r\nAny help would be grealy appreciated. \r\n\r\n* EDIT: \r\n- Downloading the labeled data from a mini-project with just over 200 annotated sentences seems to work perfectly.\r\n- Downloading the labeled data from a project with over 10 000 paragraphs, which are only partly annotated gives me issues.","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
