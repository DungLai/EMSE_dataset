First off, I'm new to this program and have never installed anything like it before. I successfully managed to set up a server by running npm start through the frontend folder.

My client does not look the same as the one they are displaying on the video.\r\n(Worth noticing too is that if I press the button \"Start Annotation\", I always end up at the same page which leads me to an unusable page)\r\nScreenshot 1: https://prnt.sc/rzctna\r\n\r\n\r\nALSO: When I try to run the server through \"python manage.py runserver\", this happens when I open the server: https://prnt.sc/rzczqn\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2: https://prnt.sc/rzczqn\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment: virtualenv env (doccano-fresh?)\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Windows 10\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.8.2\r\n*   When you install doccano: 4/13/2020\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): npm start through frontend folder\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
