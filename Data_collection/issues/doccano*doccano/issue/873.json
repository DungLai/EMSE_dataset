Open a document, and try to click the next arrow.  The application will become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.8\r\n*   When you install doccano: ~7 weeks ago\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Docker-compose\r\n\r\nI'm hoping you can help me solve this.  There does not seem to be an issue when I open a document from the Document List.  This only happens when I navigate from an already open document to the next item via the next button.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
