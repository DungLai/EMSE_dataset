I'm currently doing some sequence labelling tasks and I'm labelling some documents and the number of line breaks makes the documents nearly un-readable.  I understand that the Sequence Labelling interface has forced line spacing to allow for the labels to be easier to see, but it can be challenging when a few sentences can require scrolling.  I would break the sentences apart, except that the context between them is necessary for my labellers.","closed_by":{"login":"shensmobile","id":25826352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODI2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25826352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile","html_url":"https://github.com/shensmobile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shensmobile/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
