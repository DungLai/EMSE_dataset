I have corrected the first 1700 sentences annotated by the model, and was hoping to filter them out after exporting the annotations to ensure I would only use the sentences I had corrected. However, in the json file the document id's do not correspond to how I annotated them, so it is impossible to tell which documents I corrected and which were only preannotated. Is there any way I could export the sentences to preserve the order I annotated them, or filter the annotations made by one user (me rather than the admin that imported the model's pre-annotations). I would appreciate any help!\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Before submitting an issue, make sure to check the docs and closed issues and FAQ to see if any of the solutions work for you. https://github.com/doccano/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
