I want to label some words in this sentence, for example MS (Microsoft). MS should be labelled as a Company (so imagine that I have an entity named Company) but I also want to say that MS stands for Microsoft.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do that with Doccano?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
