I had no problem in any of the steps, except in the end I get a 502 Bad Gateway Error when I try to access the website.\r\n\r\nA possible reason would be that I operate from Singapore while the availability zones selected in the ELB step were all in East US but I don't really know what they represent: are they the zones from where you can access the website, or is it only relevant for how it works internally?\r\n\r\nThanks by advance, I don't really know which details I should provide since every step worked exactly as in the tutorial but feel free to request more.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution**: Windows 10\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.7\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/340/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
