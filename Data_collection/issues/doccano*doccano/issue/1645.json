(I have added the number since the number only shows in mouse point hover)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2233\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-20 at 10 41 57 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32409791/150249602-161f0a97-bd27-4326-b451-ecd384e1930e.png\">\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 3 members participating in annotation project. \r\n- 2 Project Admin\r\n- 1 Annotation Approver\r\n\r\nAccording to Pie Chart, the Annotation Approver seems to have completed annotation for 497 samples, as Project Admins have completed 565 samples in total.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `User Stats` show different numbers. (as below)\r\n- Annotation Approver 497 != 490\r\n- Project Admins 565 != (490 + 7)\r\n\r\nI do not know where this problem is driven from.\r\nIs there a limit to only show maximum 490 samples in `User Stats` ? (Viewing correct annotation status for each user is essential in our operation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: Python 3.8.2\r\n*   When you install doccano: September 15th 2021.\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): By following the instructions in documentation Docker (`docker pull`, `docker container create`, `docker container start` ) on Azure VM\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
