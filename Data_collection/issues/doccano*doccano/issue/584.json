The page indicator on the upper right corner only increments by one item at a time. \r\n\r\n[Here is a video that might make this more clear](https://michaelmisiewicz.com/stuff/doccano_pagination_bug_demo.mov). The bug first occurs at 0:08 and I am able to cause it again a few times. \r\n\r\nThere are no obvious errors in the browser console or logs from Nginx or Django that appear to explain it.\r\n\r\nBehavior appears to occur both in Safari and Chrome on Mac. I have observed it occurring around the transition from 10-11 which makes it seem like a pagination bug, but possibly it occurs elsewhere in sequence of documents (e.g. 145 to 146) as well. \r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n*   Operating System:\r\nCentOS 7.5 on AWS, running Docker 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a\r\n*   Python Version Used:\r\nAccording to `Dockerfile`, 3.6.\r\n*   When you install doccano:\r\nToday, from HEAD\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc):\r\nDocker compose. i.e.: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
