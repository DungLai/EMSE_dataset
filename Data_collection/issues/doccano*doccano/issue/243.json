I have installed doccano from docker image, changed only the settings part with database, so that postgressql is used\r\n\r\nWhen I added a text file \r\n[sample3.txt](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/files/3289579/sample3.txt)\r\nas document for sequence labeling, I can only annotate four or five sentences, than there will be presented an empty text and no more annotation will be available. I tried to use plan text file, but also tried to use json file, the same behaviour. I tried with admin user and \"normal\" user, no difference.\r\n\r\nIs the text file wrong?\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n   hokreb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
