Then I tried to run the project using \"python manage.py runserver\", I got the link (127.0.0.1:8000). When I clicked on the link, i have redirected to a page where it shows \"You don't have permission to view or edit anything\". Then I added \"/admin/\" to the link and got the login page. But, when I tried to login using default username (admin) and password (pass), the page shows that \"Please enter the correct username and password for a staff account\". So, I think in the installation process we create the username and password using the command line. But when user creation comes into this scenario how can i create a user.\r\n\r\nAlso what my intention is to check the mongodb and postgres Sql also azure blob storage support for the doccano. Also instead of uploading text files, I want to know whether I could select data from the table of the connected db if extracted text stored in a table.\r\n\r\nI tried to connect db by editing the DATABASES section in the base.py file and give the connection string value to the ENV DATABASE_URL in Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nWhile installing doccano using pip, how will we give the database url. You have given the format of the database url in the readme but how could we use that line to change the default sqlite.\r\n<!-- Before submitting an issue, make sure to check the docs and closed issues and FAQ to see if any of the solutions work for you. https://github.com/doccano/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
