I am using the Docker image version of Doccano running on a Windows 10 host.  For a sequence labeling project, I import data in this JSON lines format:\r\n```\r\n{\"external_id\": \"abc12345\", \"other_field\": 5, \"text\": \"hello world\"}\r\n{\"external_id\": \"abc12346\", \"other_field\": 2, \"text\": \"this is a test\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter labeling the data, I go to _Edit Data_ > _Export Data_ and export in either the _JSONL_ or _JSON(Text-Labels)_ formats (issue appears either way).  Here is the output I get with the _JSON (Text-Labels)_ output:\r\n```\r\n{\"id\": 101, \"text\": \"hello world\", \"meta\": {}, \"labels\": [[0, 6, \"Something\"]]}\r\n{\"id\": 102, \"text\": \"this is a test\", \"meta\": {}, \"labels\": []}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no \"metadata\" field as described in the documentation, and the \"meta\" field does not contain any of my metadata required to join the annotated examples back to the other relevant data required for my use case.\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nn/a","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
