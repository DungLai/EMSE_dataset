I can get annotations associated with a doc via `projects/{project_id}/examples/{id}` and grabbing the \"annotations\" key. But I can't update it. A put or patch request can only update the `meta` or `text` field.\r\n\r\nAny idea what the workaround might be? I want to upgrade and use the latest version, and I know that the docs endpoints will be deprecated so I'm trying to move away from them.\r\n\r\nHow can one update annotations via the API using the examples model/framework?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
