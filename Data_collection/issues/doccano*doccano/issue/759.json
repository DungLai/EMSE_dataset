Having a full blown SPA and deployment seems like overkill for some of the functionality, especially if you already are using django and/or django admin.\r\n\r\nSo, I would propose abstracting the server/api as a standalone django application, maybe in another git repo, and using that as a django app in this repo.  This would allow for this package to be used in existing django applications.\r\n\r\nI have already forked the repo and refactored to make it work for my purposes. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ajbeach2/doccano\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my forked changes, I did however remove everything that wasn't a server side rendered required dependency.
