I am using doccanos with the heroku app and trying to upload txt files (UTF-8) of case law (11 kB). The text is in one line and contains 1643 words. Doccanos gives the following error: \"The file could not be uploaded. Maybe invalid format. Please check available formats carefully.\". I've tried multiple times, also with less text, and sometimes it works, but most of the time not. How to resolve this?\r\n\r\nFor clarity sake, I added the text file I wanted to upload to doccanos for annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Test file.txt](https://github.com/doccano/doccano/files/6009858/Test.file.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Before submitting an issue, make sure to check the docs and closed issues and FAQ to see if any of the solutions work for you. https://github.com/doccano/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
