But I absolutely need to have a list of annotation visible somewhere on screen for the annotator. Is it a new feature to have a \"simpler\" design that removes the list of annotation ? Is there a way to add an option to make it visible again ?\r\n\r\nAlso on the right of the screen there is a \"key value\" table and I'm not sure what's supposed to be printed here.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Linux (Centos 7)\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3\r\n*   When you install doccano: docker and docker-compose\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
