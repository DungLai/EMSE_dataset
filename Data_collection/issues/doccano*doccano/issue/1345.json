The deployment worked correctly but I couldn't login with the admin account set in the environment variable. I checked in the database and saw that were not created user.\r\nI restarted with DEBUG mode and saw this error: \r\n```\r\nCreating admin`.\r\nCommandError: Enter a valid email address.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, I searched in the repository code and found no mention of environment variable `ADMIN_CONTACT_EMAIL` (defined in the Google Cloud Run parameters) except in 2 specific Heroku files. \r\nSo, I tried by renaming `ADMIN_CONTACT_EMAIL` to `ADMIN_EMAIL` directly in the Google Cloud Run parameters.\r\n\r\nI restarted with DEBUG mode and saw this in the logs: \r\n```\r\nCreating admin`.\r\nSuperuser created successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried to login and everything was working correctly.\r\n\r\nThis issue is probably linked with the same problem that I had: https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1140.\r\n\r\nPossible correction to do\r\n-------\r\n- Change in the Gcloud One-click Deployment Script from `ADMIN_CONTACT_EMAIL` to `ADMIN_EMAIL` (but I don't know where this environment variable is defined in this repository)\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: /\r\n*   Python Version Used: /\r\n*   When you install doccano: 4th of May 2021\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Gcloud One-Click Deployment\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
