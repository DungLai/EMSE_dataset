Nearly every time, you annotate a word (for example at sequence labeling), the line breaks in the text changing. This is a bit confusing for the user so it would be better if the text, once displayed, stays the same.\r\n\r\nMaybe related to #1378 and #1355\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce the behaviour\r\n---------\r\n\r\n1. Go to the main page of your Doccano installations, or use the official Heroku Demo: https://doccano.herokuapp.com/demo/named-entity-recognition \r\n2. Tag a word\r\n3. The text will have new line breaks (annotated \"extended\" with PER in the text below)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39307599/119222525-21196b80-baf5-11eb-893f-fa6e45da2eb3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39307599/119222532-2971a680-baf5-11eb-8521-c12ff42bd570.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: MacOs / Firefox and Safari latest Verions\r\n*   Python Version Used: From Dockerfile\r\n*   When you install doccano: 2021-20-05\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Docker/Ubuntu 20\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
