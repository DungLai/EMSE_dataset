Under \"Django administration\" (https://<host>/admin/api/sequencelabelingproject/1/change/), the project (it's a Sequence labeling project) shows 4 users, including the one who can't see the project.  \r\n![Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117848028-e3912480-b250-11eb-9375-aabb8760b8af.png)\r\n\r\nUnder 'Groups' (https://<host>/admin/auth/group/), I created a group 'AllPermissions', which has all the permissions under the heading of \"Chosen permissions.\"  \r\n![Group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117847798-b04e9580-b250-11eb-9fd5-1d53f7862b3b.png)\r\n\r\nUnder 'Users',  and this user in particular (https://<host>/admin/auth/user/3/change/), the user is listed as \"Active\" and belonging to the \"AllPermissions\" group under the \"Chosen groups\" heading.  (I actually want to limit this user's permissions, but I gave them all permissions for purposes of debugging.)  No separate permissions are listed under \"Chosen user permissions\".  (I also tried adding all permissions here, as well as by the chosen group, but that didn't help.)\r\n![User](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117848056-ea1f9c00-b250-11eb-9841-1d0c13a8acc4.png)\r\n\r\nWhen this user logs in and clicks on the Projects button, nothing happens; no projects are listed.  The user can create a new project, but cannot log into or even see an existing project.\r\n![AddProject](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83593186/117846729-b1cb8e00-b24f-11eb-8d6c-1571bf9b7533.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcswell2001","id":83593186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTkzMTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83593186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001","html_url":"https://github.com/mcswell2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcswell2001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
