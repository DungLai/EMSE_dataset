It appeared to be fine, none of the users, even Admin could reach the projects page, though. There was always 404 error. Well, when the admin creates the project on the web interface, it appears until the next log in. Then the page again could not be found (404 error) \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51916323/69699433-f1a0c300-10f8-11ea-83b4-50f9ac4f5489.png)\r\nSo, due to that, the decision to use an older version of doccano was made. \r\nIt was compiled from the binaries. Everything seemed to be fine, except for no role were available. So I created two roles (the spelling really matters, otherwise nothing will work). But as soon as I did it, admin no longer can see any of the projects on the web interface (I even tried to create the other user with admin privileges, the same thing). So I have to put the url myself, which is not comfortable.. At least, I cannot see the name of the project, so have to memorize the project id..\r\nOne more thing to mention, now admin is never greeted by the web interface with it's name. on the name spot just space. I guess it actually the main problem here since the user with such a name naturally is not allowed to view projects.\r\n![Сни22мок](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51916323/69700139-c919c880-10fa-11ea-8476-59b14045ece7.JPG)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to solve it?\r\nThank you a lot.\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Before submitting an issue, make sure to check the docs and closed issues and FAQ to see if any of the solutions work for you. https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Include a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
