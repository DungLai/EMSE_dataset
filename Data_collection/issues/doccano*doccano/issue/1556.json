Please try to be as specific as possible. -->\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System:\r\n```\r\nOperating System: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)\r\nKernel: Linux 3.10.0-1160.45.1.el7.x86_64\r\nArchitecture: x86-64\r\n```\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.9.5\r\n*   When you install doccano: Nov 10, 2021\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): ``docker pull doccano/doccano:1.5``\r\n\r\nObserved\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* Create a project for sequence labeling\r\n* Create a dataset with pre-existing labels. To reproduce this problem, use the sample dataset:\r\n```\r\n{\"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"label\": [ [0, 2, \"ORG\"]]}\r\n{\"text\": \"Peter Blackburn\", \"label\": [ [0, 15, \"PERSON\"] ]}\r\n{\"text\": \"President Obama\", \"label\": [ [10, 15, \"PERSON\"] ]}\r\n```\r\n* Then create 3 users\r\n    * admin (created when docker container is created)\r\n    * user1 (with admin role)\r\n    * user2 (with annotator role)\r\n\r\n* Import the dataset while logged in as Admin role\r\n   * Observe that the pre-existing labels are visible (thanks for the fix!)\r\n\r\n* Logout and login as User1\r\n  * Pre-existing labels are not visible\r\n\r\n* Logout and login as User2\r\n  * Pre-existing labels are also not visible\r\n\r\nExpected\r\n---------\r\n\r\nPre-existing labels are visible by all users regardless of role. Furthermore, all annotators should have permission to delete a pre-existing label. \r\n\r\nI saw this in doccano:1.5\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to issue: https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1540\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1556/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
