What specific solution would you like? -->\r\nThe general idea of the request is to set up a document classification project where not every potential label is present on every single document. The best way to describe the project would be scoring the results of a multi-label classification project. After getting the results of the classification, I'd like to upload with each document a label that represents the returned results of the multi-label classification project and a label for incorrect. Currently, if you uploaded documents with different non-incorrect labels, both are added to the label section and both appear as options in the annotate section.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n1. You upload a document with text and label as follows, and add to the label section a label for \"incorrect\".\r\n\r\n| text   | label   |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| dog    | animal |\r\n| apple  | fruit  |\r\n| david  | person |\r\n| google | animal |\r\n\r\n2. When you enter the annotation section you see the label it was uploaded with as the selected label but all other labels as options (see screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81196676/196264740-bb9ebf8a-2acb-4a9b-a0ca-eba6003abc9b.png)\r\n\r\nOptimally, the uploaded label and the universal label we added (\"incorrect\") would be the only two label options that show up, such as the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81196676/196265078-3ffccc7d-9325-436d-a832-96e23f29cc76.png)\r\n\r\nIt may require a new project type, please let me know how I can help!\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nOS: Docker\r\nDoccano Version: v1.8.0\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
