Now I need to customize the user interface. What I did is simply editing the files in the folder `frontend/pages/index.vue`.\r\nI removed the following three lines (in comments):\r\n`<template>\r\n  <v-content>\r\n    <!-- <the-top-banner /> -->\r\n    <!-- <feature-cards /> -->\r\n    <!-- <the-bottom-banner /> -->\r\n  </v-content>\r\n</template>` \r\nWhen I push to the github and the Heroku built it again, the landing page doesn't change. I wonder if I need to do other things to make these modifications effective.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
