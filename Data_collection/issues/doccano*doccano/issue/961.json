It appears that, during the type system import, the types get reassigned new IDs. Once annotation is done the two exported datasets have the same type system, but different type IDs, and hence have to be joined over the label text string. In other words, the effective use of exported label sets is impaired, as it needs to be re-exported after import to allow for proper postprocessing.\r\n\r\nI recommend that type IDs should become UUIDs that do not cause ID conflicts at import time and allow easier label set maintenance across projects.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: default as per docker config\r\n*   When you install doccano:\r\nEarly July 2020, update to latest release on July 23\r\n*   How did you install doccano:\r\nLocal `docker-compose` deployment\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/961/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
