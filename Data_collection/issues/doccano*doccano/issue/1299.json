If you do this multiple times you may find it sometimes numbers from 1, and sometimes from 10\r\n\r\nIf it output the class strings, or IDs that consistently started from one number of counted up from there I could create models that play nice with the output format. Right now I need to check the output and perform different transformations depending on what shows up.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's some way to configure this under the 'labels' tab?
