However, some workflows used for NLP require input as lists of words and list of token labels:\r\n```\r\nSample sentence: \r\n['Two', ',', 'Samsung', 'based', ',', 'electronic', 'cash', 'registers', 'were', 'reconstructed', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'expand', 'their', 'functions', 'and', 'adapt', 'them', 'for', 'networking', '.']\r\n\r\nSample sentence labels: \r\n['O', 'O', 'I-ORG', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']\r\n```\r\nIt is referenced in an earlier issue  (#7) that this was done like this due to the fact that some languages are not space-separated. I think it would be good to have the option and users that annotate space-separated languages can use that for seamless input to their workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample taken from: https://github.com/microsoft/nlp/blob/master/examples/named_entity_recognition/ner_wikigold_bert.ipynb\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/386/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
