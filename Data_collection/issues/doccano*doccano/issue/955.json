Specifically, any elements nested in ```<div class=\"tui-editor-contents\"></div>``` do not adjust their colouring to the dark background. The low contrast between the text and the background makes it difficult to read the guidelines in dark mode.\r\n\r\nCandidate solution\r\n---------\r\nAdd a ```<style>``` tag at the bottom of ```doccano/frontend/layouts/project.vue``` and apply nested selectors on ```.theme--dark .tui-editor-contents``` for many markdown elements of interest. For example:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.theme--dark .tui-editor-contents h1 {\r\n  color: #fff; /* inversion of #000 */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n__Note:__ I used a simple [colour inverter tool](https://colorinverter.imageonline.co/) to find the inverse of the base colours that were used in light mode.\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\n---------\r\nI implemented the solution above in a feature branch on my fork of this repository. I'm not sure what the intended design pattern for this CSS is, but the solution above appears to address the issue. If the proposed solution is fine with the owners, I can open a pull request for review. Alternatively, I'm open to suggestions if there's a preferred design pattern that more appropriately addresses this issue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
