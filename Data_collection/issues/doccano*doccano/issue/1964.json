This makes the cloud SQL database interrupt the service and crash the app. \r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea on how to force Doccano to close open database connections?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment. -->\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: MacOS\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.9.12\r\n*   When you install doccano: v1.8.0\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): on GCP with external managed CloudSQL database\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
