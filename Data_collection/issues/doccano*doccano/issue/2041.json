This issue is about **documentation** and I know you recommend making a PR first, but since my time is a bit constrained I first would like to have insights about the need of this :warning: \r\n\r\n## Context\r\nAs an a analyst, I work a lot on text classifications that are extracted from an external platform. These text chunks have each an ID that I must have after annotation, which I could handle thanks to the metadata field when I import data.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I dive through the documentation (https://doccano.github.io/doccano/tutorial/) on the section of importing dataset, I find not trace of such possibility, which can be quite useful.\r\n\r\nI would like to add a section in the *import a Dataset* section that gives insight about how the file can handle metadata, and more widely informations that are shown nearby annotations. Am I suggesting something worth ?\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: One-click heroku deployment\r\n- **Python version**: 3.8\r\nImprovement would be funded by Open Source Politics ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2041/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
