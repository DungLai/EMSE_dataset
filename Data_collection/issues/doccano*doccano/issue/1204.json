As you know, invoices are structured in quite a tabular fashion. Here is an example string:\r\n```\r\n\"\"\"\r\n   Invoice Date   12/29/2020                       cust #:   D105                                               \r\n                                                                                                                \r\n   Invoice #      87924                            Packing Slip #      21094                                    \r\n                                                                                                                \r\n   Cust PO #      5000032280               0       Freight/Partial Pricing                                      \r\n                                                                                                                \r\n                                                                                                                \r\nLine #       PRODUCT #         CUST CODE                 DESCRIPTION           TOTAL     COST     INVOICE AMOUNT\r\n     1      HV-1353-K      20LD1301I-KK           HEATSET GLOSS                   1792   $1.800      $3,225.60  \r\n                                                  OVERPRINT VARNISH                                             \r\n     2      HV-1354-K      20LD1303I-KK           HEATSET SATIN OVERPRINT         1792   $2.100      $3,763.20  \r\n                                                  VARNISH                                                       \r\n                                                                                         Total      $6,988.80   \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nNotice a few things in this example string:\r\n- The alignment in the text. Things appear one below the other, perfectly aligned.\r\n- The string is \"equalized\", i.e., spaces have been added to the end of lines to equalize the length of rows to the row with the maximum length. Also \"empty\" lines have been filled with spaces\r\n\r\nThe second point is more important, because this is how i want my dataset to be.\r\n\r\nMy dataset also contains some labels in the example jsonl format given by doccano. The dataset entry looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"text\":   \"Invoice Date   12/29/2020                       cust #:   D105                                               \\n                                                                                                                \\n   Invoice #      87924                            Packing Slip #      21094                                    \\n                                                                                                                \\n   Cust PO #      5000032280               0       Freight/Partial Pricing                                      \\n                                                                                                                \\n                                                                                                                \\nLine #       PRODUCT #         CUST CODE                 DESCRIPTION           TOTAL     COST     INVOICE AMOUNT\\n     1      HV-1353-K      20LD1301I-KK           HEATSET GLOSS                   1792   $1.800      $3,225.60  \\n                                                  OVERPRINT VARNISH                                             \\n     2      HV-1354-K      20LD1303I-KK           HEATSET SATIN OVERPRINT         1792   $2.100      $3,763.20  \\n                                                  VARNISH                                                       \\n                                                                                         Total      $6,988.80   \",\r\n\"labels\": [[1713, 1718, \"I-NUM\"], [1939, 1949, \"I-PO\"]]}\r\n```\r\nNote: Ignore the value of the index of the labels, there is more text before what i have shown here which i cannot show. This part is further down in the document, hence the bigger index numbers. I have verified that the indices are indeed correct.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 issues i encounter when trying to annotate this document. Both can be seen in this image:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IbyKHIQ\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the image, there are 2 issues:\r\n- The text, which was once aligned, is now misaligned. This can be because the extra spaces are spilling into the next line. Is there a way to decrease font size or make sure the text just truncates?\r\n- I suspect that because of the first issue, the pre-existing labels in the dataset are showing in the wrong places. If i change them in the UI and download the dataset again, the values of the indices haven't changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment details:\r\n*   Operating System: Win10 20H2\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.8.7\r\n*   When you install doccano: 8-Feb-2021\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): using pip install\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
