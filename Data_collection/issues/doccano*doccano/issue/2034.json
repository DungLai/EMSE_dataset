We're hoping to start up some continuous annotation projects in the near future (ones where new annotation tasks come in on a weekly or even daily cadence), and we have two options for managing new annotation tasks:\r\n1. Create Doccano projects for the continuous annotation effort as a whole and keep adding new tasks to them as they come in.\r\n2. Create separate projects for each new batch of annotations.\r\n\r\nAre there any benefits/drawbacks to either approach from a Doccano perspective? (I.e. will things slow down if we're working in a project with many thousands of tasks? Will large numbers of projects somehow gum up the system? etc.)","closed_by":{"login":"lance132","id":51332978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMyOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51332978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132","html_url":"https://github.com/lance132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lance132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/2034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
