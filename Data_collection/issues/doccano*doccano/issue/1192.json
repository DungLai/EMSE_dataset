Apparently some steps are needed before this cloned repository can be used. \r\nI also did run the following steps from within the ./app subdirectory:\r\n``` \r\npython manage.py collectstatic --noinput\r\npython manage.py wait_for_db\r\npython manage.py migrate\r\npython manage.py create_roles\r\npython manage.py create_admin --username admin --password admin --email me@somewhere.com --noinput\r\n```\r\nBut after this, running doccan still produces just a Server error.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to install from the cloned directory? \r\n\r\nThis would perhaps make it much easier to work around the issue #1191 because one could make some local changes first and then run from the modified repo?","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
