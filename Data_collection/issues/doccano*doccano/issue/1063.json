What specific solution would you like? -->\r\n\r\nA usecase where Level 1 annotator annotates certain documents and other Level 1 annotator annotates other documents assigend to him. (As siad by https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/948). Right now any annotator in a project annotates all the docs but he should only annotate documnets assigned to him. It should also happen that once he presses a finish button on any document then he should not get popped back to annotate till admin assigns it back to him.\r\n\r\nComing back for example we have Documnets annotated by 2 L1 annotators, They should be separately assigned to Level 2 annotator who is more senior or if we have many L2 annotators they should get pre annotaed L1 documents. These documents should also be assigned separately (Not all docs to each L2 annotator). In real we should have flexibility in choosing as many levels as possible which an admin will set. \r\n\r\nWe should also have flexibility which annotator annotated a document and at what Level (1,2,3 etc) \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
