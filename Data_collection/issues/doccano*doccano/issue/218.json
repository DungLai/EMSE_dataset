I have around 1000 sentences in my file. When I try to import it, it takes only the first 500 sentences (100 pages after import) and the rest are gone. This looks like a **bug**. \r\n\r\nThe only way to work around it is to split the input and import consequitively in batches of 500 sentences. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"olix20","id":912111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjExMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/912111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20","html_url":"https://github.com/olix20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olix20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
