However, when an approver starts reviewing annotations, they cannot see what tags other users have created (even the admin cannot see) by default. They have to press the ✖️ button first and only then annotations from other users are visible. But now even though they can see the annotations after pressing ✖️, they cannot delete them, shows 403 error (only admins can delete annotations).\r\n\r\nEdit: I have tried to add individual labeling permissions from the `admin page > users > user page`, still no change\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n*   Operating System: MacOS Mojave\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3\r\n*   When you install doccano: April 8 (a guess)\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): docker\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
