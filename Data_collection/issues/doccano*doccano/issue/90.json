This may lead users to install unnecessary packages on some cases, for example package like `flake8` may be unnecessay for production deployment  while `gunicorn` may be unnecesary for development installation and if someone wants to deploy doccano using a different application server like [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to have separate requirements files for different use cases, for example\r\n\r\n- `requirements.txt` for basic requirements\r\n- `requirements_dev.txt` for development requirements\r\n- `requirements_<gunicorn/something>.txt` for deployment or platform specific requirements\r\n\r\nI have done that at https://github.com/tehamalab/doccano/tree/group-requirements . If it sounds good  I can submit a pull request\r\n\r\nAdditionally, why `tornado` is among the dependancies?\r\n\r\nThank you very much building doccano.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
