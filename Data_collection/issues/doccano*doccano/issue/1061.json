However when I follow the same procedure on a EC2 instance, I am unable to. Below are the steps I followed in EC2:\r\n\r\n1. Created a EC2 instance with default hardware config of t2.micro, 8 GB HDD and operating system is Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS \r\n2. Executed the below commands in terminal\r\n   \r\n>  #sudo apt-get update\r\n>  #sudo apt-get install docker.io\r\n>  #sudo apt-get install docker-compose \r\n>  #git clone https://github.com/doccano/doccano.git\r\n>  #cd doccano\r\n>  #sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up\r\n\r\n3. Yes I am trying to run the development version of Doccano. When I execute the above docker-compose command I get below logs (snippet below) and then EC2 instance lags for sometime, eventually it does come back to its normal state but doccano_frontend_1 fails to start. \r\n\r\n> #sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up\r\n> ...\r\n> backend_1   | Role created successfully \"annotation_approver\"\r\n> frontend_1  | Done in 132.49s.\r\n> frontend_1  | Starting frontend server\r\n> frontend_1  | yarn run v1.21.1\r\n> frontend_1  | $ eslint --fix --ext .js,.vue --ignore-path .gitignore .\r\n> backend_1   | Setting password for User admin.\r\n> backend_1   | Superuser created successfully.\r\n> backend_1   | Starting django\r\n> backend_1   | Watching for file changes with StatReloader\r\n> frontend_1  | Done in 12.74s.\r\n> frontend_1  | yarn run v1.21.1\r\n> frontend_1  | $ nuxt\r\n> frontend_1  | ℹ Listening on: http://172.19.0.3:3000/\r\n> frontend_1  | ℹ Preparing project for development\r\n> frontend_1  | ℹ Initial build may take a while\r\n> frontend_1  | ✔ Builder initialized\r\n> frontend_1  | ✔ Nuxt files generated\r\n> frontend_1  | ℹ Compiling Client\r\n> frontend_1  |\r\n> frontend_1  |  ERROR  (node:283) ExperimentalWarning: Conditional exports is an experimental feature.
