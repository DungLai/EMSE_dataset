The button clicked, the firefox console shows the following error:\r\n ```\r\nTypeError: this.$t is not a function\r\n    create http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:8\r\n    click http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:8\r\n    Ve http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    n http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    _wrapper http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    Je http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    Ke http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    ze http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    Ve http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    n http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n    _wrapper http://192.168.99.100:8000/static/bundle/projects.js:14\r\n```\r\nI use win10 home, so Docker works on Docker Tool Box. I installed and launched Doccano by typing following command on 2020/09/30 11:00, then accessed http://192.168.99.100:8000. \r\n```\r\n> docker pull doccano/doccano\r\n> docker run -d --rm --name doccano -e \"ADMIN_USERNAME=admin\" -e \"ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com\"  -e \"ADMIN_PASSWORD=password\" -p 8000:8000 doccano/doccano\r\n```\r\nI tried to change the browser, but nothing changed. Also, `docker pull chakkiworks/doccano` reproduced the same situation. \r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment. -->\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Windows 10 home, version 1903\r\n*   Docker   :19.03.1\r\n*   image \"doccano/doccano\" : created on \"2020-09-29T06:40:21.924764145Z\"\r\n*   Virtual Box:  6.1.10 r138449 (Qt5.6.2)\r\n*   Linux in Virtual Box: Boot2Docker 19.03.5\r\n*   Browser: Firefox 80.0.1 (64bit), Chrome 85.0.4183.121 Official Build(64bit)\r\n*   When you install doccano: 2020/09/30 11:00\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): Docker pull doccano/doccano\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1008/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
