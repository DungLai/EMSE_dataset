It's working but the UI is different, the live demo has the list of available tags on the top of the page above the document - when I run locally this isn't shown? Is the lice demo an older version - I'm running the latest commit from github? I'm specifically interested in named-entity-recognition.\r\n\r\nI can select tags by highlighting a region and sometimes a context menu appears with my tags (but sometimes it doesn't). I can also press one of the keys I bound to each tag - again sometimes it highlights a tag and sometimes it doesn't.","closed_by":{"login":"david-waterworth","id":5028974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth","html_url":"https://github.com/david-waterworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-waterworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1035/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
