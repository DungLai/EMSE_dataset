I also tried to log in to the admin UI with the default \"admin\" and \"password\" credentials and it didn't work.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem : \r\nThe deployment button did'nt worked for me and I wanted to deploy in europe-west1 zone so \r\n1. I forked the project (and added no modification in it)\r\n2. I created an image using : gcloud builds submit \r\n(no problem until now, the image is well created)\r\n3. On Google Cloud Run I deployed the image and all worked well so I can go to the url of the deployed doccano. But I don't have admin account. I checked the logs and I noticed no mention of credentials for the admin.\r\n\r\nShould the doccano/tools/create-admin.sh be executed in the cloudbuild.yaml ? Or did I miss something ?\r\n\r\nHave a nice day,\r\nBenoit","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
