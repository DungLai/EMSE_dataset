So far, several people have already completed their labeling (100%) on the same data set. The data set had been imported from a standard CSV file with utf-8 encoding and ';' as separator.\r\n\r\nMy labeling progress is at 81%. The annotation worked just fine for me for several days.\r\n\r\nBut now, when I click on the 'Start Annotation' button to continue labeling, I get a blank space instead of the annotation section. The rest of the UI (side bar and top bar) stays the same.\r\n\r\nThe relative URL path I get is */projects/1/text-classification?page=99&q=&isChecked=false*.\r\n\r\nWhat did I try to solve the problem\r\n---------\r\n* I restarted the EC2 instance, and started doccano webserver and task again.\r\n* I manipulated the URL and tried if something changes. Nothing changes. There are less than 99 samples left to annotate. However, clicking on the 'Start Annotation' button produces the URL as shown above. E.g. substituting the '99' with '1' changes nothing.\r\n\r\nMy Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*  an AWS EC2 instance (t2.micro)\r\n* Ubuntu x86_64 based on kernel version 5.15.0-1013-aws\r\n* Python 3.10.4, pip 22.0.2\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1874/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
