Python 3.9. And have a doccano installation through pip3.\r\n\r\nI have been doing Text annotation with sequence labeling.\r\nSo i import .txt files, and .json labels and then begin the annotation process.\r\n\r\nBut each time i finish to annotate, export both .jsonl dataset and the .json label data, the .jsonl dataset loses its labels when i try to import it again into a new project to test out what i intend on submiting to my supervisor.\r\n\r\nI raised the issue with him and he told me he always sees the labels. However personally, i cant see them. But opening the old dataset that i exported still shows the correctly annotated data and my labels.\r\nThen even for the .json labels, each time i import them into a new project, i realise they lose their colors and short keys.\r\n\r\nUsually, i use the same labels over a long period of time, but each time i'm annotating a new project, i always have to edit the labels manually which can be very tiresome and time consuming.\r\n\r\nThe same issue happens on chrome and firefox.\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced this before?\r\nIf so, how do i solve this?\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
