When executing docker-compose up command, it is able to download the required images. However when the container gets started and the setup commands are executed, I get `could not resolve deb.debian.org` and `unable to look for github.com` errors.\r\n\r\nI suspect that I was able to download the images because that happened at host level. However the proxy configuration doesn't seem correct inside container. \r\n\r\nI refereed this [link](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/) for proxy setup, however I am on docker v1.13.1 (organizational restrictions) with docker-compose version v1.27. So the only option for me was to set `HTTP_PROXY` env variable at host level. I also updated the docker-compose.dev.yml to have following changes\r\n```\r\nenvironment:\r\n      POSTGRES_USER: \"doccano\"\r\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: \"doccano\"\r\n      POSTGRES_DB: \"doccano\"\r\n      HTTP_PROXY: \"http://proxy.eu.novartis.net:2010/\"\r\n      HTTPS_PROXY: \"http://proxy.eu.novartis.net:2010/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I am still facing the same issue. i.e. Network resolution error while container setup.
