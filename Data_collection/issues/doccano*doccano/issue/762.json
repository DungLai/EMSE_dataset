The new project needs these labels and it very cumbersome to manually recreate the label set in the new project.\r\n\r\nWhy can't you create a new project and copy labels using label download from old project and upload to new project? See #443 \r\n\r\n1. I haven't seen the UI option in #443 to export / import labels. I'm using docker image version:\r\n```\r\n$ docker image ls\r\nREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\r\ndoccano/doccano     latest              4f018c685336        4 weeks ago         459MB\r\n```\r\n2. I'm trying to figure out how to use the rest api to download labels and copy to another project. This may unblock me (when I figure out the authentication from python). However, we are trying to adopt this tool due to its UI benefits and this is impacting us.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
