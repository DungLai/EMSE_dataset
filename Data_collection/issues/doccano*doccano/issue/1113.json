But in UI, on Annotation page, we get 20 documents per batch. So we have to shuffle 20 documents per request, only.\r\n\r\nProposal: remove that mechanism and implement more simple and more pseudo-random instead.\r\n\r\nRelated: #1072, https://github.com/doccano/doccano/pull/1072#discussion_r531214151, #1099.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
