Importantly, this will allow developers to frequently test only a small portion of the test coverage for the specific feature they are working on. It is much faster to test only a small portion of the code base compared to re-running the entire test suite.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Django uses ```unittest``` (included in the Python standard library), which allows you to point to a directory and recursively discover all tests that match a particular pattern (by deafult any files starting with ```test_*``` I think).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this would not add any complexity in how tests are run, but would make tests more organized and easier to extend as new features are added.\r\n\r\nOne pattern I have seen is splitting the ```tests/``` folder into ```unit```, ```integration```, and ```system``` tests, and then further stratifying those into subfolders based on which part of the application is being tested (e.g. ```unit/models```, ```unit/utils```, etc).\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
