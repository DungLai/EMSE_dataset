It would be greate if the labeller can set both the document class and mark the sequence labels at the same time. As I understood, with the current setting this means that one project for *Document Classification* and one for *Sequence Labeling* needs to be set up and the labeller needs to go over the data set twice.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any hint or help.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/757/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
