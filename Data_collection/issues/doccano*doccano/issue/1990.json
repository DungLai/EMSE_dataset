Now, this can save a huge amount of time with annotating the same thing over and over. This behavior can be the \"default\" one when auto-labeling is enabled as an alternative to the APIs.\r\n\r\nThis may only be an issue where the same word has different labels in the same document. For example, \"Apple\" refers to the company or the fruit. This means this feature should be optional, like the \"auto-labeling,\" and the user should be aware of that risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I am not suggesting an already-implemented feature (otherwise, I would be super happy to use it).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
