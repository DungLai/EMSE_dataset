It's amazing!\r\n\r\nI just have one problem, namely, when I export the annotated data I have id of labels that I think are internal for doccano. Unfortunately, it might be the case that if you edit your labels (either change their names or delete and add new) you can end up with ids like 4, 7, 13 even though you have only 3 labels in whole project. In the end I have no idea what 4, 7 and 13 stands for. Would you consider keeping numerical order (1, 2, 3.. or 0, 1, 2...) and exporting labels metadata for example in format {1: \"firstlabel\", 2: \"secondlabel\", ...} ? It would be great for post-processing the annotated data. \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
