It failed because it could not find the AMI.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI am in the ap-east-1 region. This is important because AMIs are local to a region. But I suspect the ami not even exist anymore. Has anyone else tried to deploy the cfn template recently?\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n---------\r\n\r\nConsider using something like this:\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/query-for-the-latest-amazon-linux-ami-ids-using-aws-systems-manager-parameter-store/\r\n\r\nAlso, it was doubly frustrating because I could not easily find anywhere in the documentation what image it was using. Just the non-existent AMI id. So I had to guess that you were using ubuntu 16.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
