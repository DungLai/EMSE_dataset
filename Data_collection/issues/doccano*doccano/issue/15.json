Feature Request\r\nWhen in a Sequence Labeling project, it would be nice to be able to export the data in a format like [spacy's training](https://spacy.io/usage/training#training-simple-style)

problem\r\nThis feature would make the file we're downloading a lot smaller and also make offline entity labeling pipelines a lot
