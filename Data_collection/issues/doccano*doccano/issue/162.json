I create Project A.\r\n2. Import some annotated data to the project - set of labels is automatically created as a result (let's say, Label 1, Label 2, Label 3)\r\n3. I edit these labels - provide a shortcut and color\r\n4. I create Project B and import another portion of dataset (with the same set of labels)\r\n5. I try to replicate setting of Project A (assign the same shortcuts, colors and label names to labels), which gives me an error:\r\n`You cannot use same label name or shortcut key.`\r\n\r\nIt seems not very convenient that we cannot create labels with the same shortcut and label name in different project.
