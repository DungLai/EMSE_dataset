The feature that is not supported is importing text that contains relationships to doccano. Only the export is possible. Use cases:\r\n\r\n-  Assume i export the annotated tokens and relationships and text from one instance of doccano. Then, i want to import the exported data into another instance of doccano. That is not supported\r\n- Assume i have a model that can partially perform annotation and relationship extraction. I would like humans to finalize this work (e.g., semi-supervised labeling). Currently, we cannot import text containing relationships to the tool. \r\n- Assume i have built some relationships using a model, and want to use doccano to show case the results in a visually digestible way to users. \r\n\r\nProposed solution: Please add a feature that allows importing text that already contains annotations and relationships to Doccano using the same exact format/template that annotations/relationships are currently exported out the tool. \r\n\r\nThank you very much !\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
