And did a bit of annotation. \r\n\r\nAfter that I have trained a model based on that annotated data and then hosted the model in the second EC2 instance and created a very simple API using FastAPI on top of it. \r\n\r\nThat api is accessible from my local.\r\n\r\nThat API is accessible **when I am setting up auto labelling** \r\n![Screenshot from 2022-12-06 22-19-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5349112/205972790-f5c38632-54db-4ae7-82d3-16244d4f2eb2.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the rest of the steps to set up auto labelling works perfectly fine\r\n\r\nmapping step\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-12-06 22-21-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5349112/205973184-0486ac71-3aee-4020-8484-4a6a7d6a8b17.png)\r\n\r\nfinal step\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-12-06 22-23-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5349112/205973539-96f643d9-aefc-4e8d-aa0e-61dc6e4226e8.png)\r\n\r\nAfter all this it looks like this - \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-12-06 22-24-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5349112/205973895-7e6ff8bd-5a50-42a8-8a96-488d6500d895.png)\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood from the official tutorial and the thread [here](https://github.com/doccano/doccano/issues/1417) this should be all I need to do.\r\n\r\nHowever once all these are done, the most strange thing starts to happen. I go to the datasets and open one document. And the click on the magic wand. It shows that it is switched off. I slide it on. And ...\r\n\r\nNOTHING HAPPENS!! \r\n\r\nI checked the model server log and as well and doccano server log. NO  ACTIVITY. \r\n\r\nSo it is like this - \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-12-06 22-30-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5349112/205975188-3c4aa9c0-c583-447e-bab1-005b3eb5db6c.png)\r\n\r\nAnd no labels show.\r\n\r\nI switch it on\r\n\r\nAnd no labels show.\r\n\r\nNo log in server both doccano and the model one.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER,\r\n\r\nWhen I was setting this up and I tested the result I did see the log in the server, meaning doccano could actually communicate successfully. \r\n\r\nI have checked the chrome developer window. I see nothing (I am using Brave).\r\n\r\nWhat is going wrong here? What am I missing?\r\n\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Before submitting an issue, make sure to check the docs and closed issues and FAQ to see if any of the solutions work for you. https://github.com/doccano/doccano/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Include a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
