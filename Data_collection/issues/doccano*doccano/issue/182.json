The problem is that {TRAVIS_TAG} is filled only when git commit is tagged, which no one is doing here :-). As a result images at dockerhub can only be found as latest, it is impossible to refer to a fixed version. What do you think about changing (or adding one more) build with {TRAVIS_COMMIT}  as version?  This might help in avoiding non obvious errors when latest version will be different on local machine (outdated) and on CI server.
