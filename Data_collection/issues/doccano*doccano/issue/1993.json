Doccano has been my go-to annotation tool to construct annotated ML datasets ðŸ˜„.\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to Doccano so I'm not sure whether my intended usecase already exists. If a Doccano developer can confirm that my feature request exists I can close my issue afterwards ðŸ˜Š.\r\n\r\n## Motivation behind Feature Request\r\n\r\nRecently I've been finding myself collaborating with multiple annotators (>5) on my team. In such scenarios each annotator is assigned a subset of a bigger dataset to annotate. So far how I've been approaching this problem is that I've been creating a project for each annotator and adding a partitioned subset in that annotator's assigned project.\r\n\r\nHowever I've been finding that this multiple project assignment paradigm results in a lot of manual steps that doesn't scale well as the number of annotators grows:\r\n\r\n- For each project you now have to manually track the progress.\r\n- For each project you have to download the datasets when they are completed.\r\n- For each project you have to upload a partitioned subset to be annotated.\r\n- For each project you have to add members to that project.\r\n- For each project you have to define labels + guidelines.\r\n\r\n## Description of Feature Request\r\n\r\nRather than pursuing the multiple project paradigm approach above, I was envisioning an alternative direction:\r\n\r\n1. Define one project and assign multiple annotators.\r\n2. Upload a single dataset to that project.\r\n3. Have an option to partition the dataset into subsets and assign a subset to each annotator. An annotator would only be able to view and work on their own subset.\r\n4. The project admin account can then just download the final dataset once from one project once the annotators complete their work.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to hear from Doccano devs on whether such a FR would be valuable and / or technically feasible?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
