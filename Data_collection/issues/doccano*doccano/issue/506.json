I am able to prune the number of labels required to annotate any given document. However I do not know how to inject this \"filtering\" mechanism into the doccano codebase.  \r\nA really elegant way to provide this functionality might simply be to allow a \"permittedlabels\"  key  in addition to the {\"text\": \"...\", labels:[[span, 'label_val'], []...] , \"permitted_labels\": [\"<>\", \"<>\"...] }  when importing json formatted docs. Only the labels in this permitted list would be available in the context menu upon highlighting a piece of text. Any suggestions/fixes would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\np.s. Apologies for this feature request which might very well be trivial to implement. I am a ml engineer trying to help our labeling team use doccano (great project..so thank you devs for the effort!).   As I am inexperienced with vue/frontend dev and despite knowing basic django I have been unable to figure out how to do this myself.  I would be happy if there is an easy way to provide  this feature... or if someone knows how to, and could guide me through it  I would be happy to do the work and submit the PR (if the repo maintainers think it would be a useful feature). \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/506/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
