I have defined two labels which show up above the text in the annotation interface and a user can select either or both. However since this is not multilabel classification, I would like that only one can be selected.\r\n* how does annotating the same document by different users work? I tested this using different users and I only get one of the annotations by one user in the exported data, even though two different users have annotated the same document in two different ways. Should this work?
