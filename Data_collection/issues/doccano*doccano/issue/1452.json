I have now created another sequence labeling project, and I want to use the *same* documents for this new project.  \r\n\r\n_What I can do:_\r\nI'm logged in as an administrator, and in the \"Django administration\" page I select \"Documents\" over on the left.  This shows the documents I previously uploaded, all assigned to the earlier project.  I click on the box next to \"TEXT\" just above this list, which selects the first 100 documents; I can additionally click on the \"select all 742 documents\" link.  \r\n\r\n_What I would expect_: \r\nI would think I could then choose from the \"Action\" drop-down some action having to do with assigning the selected documents to another project.\r\n\r\n_What happens instead_:\r\nThe only action under the \"Action\" drop-down is \"Delete selected documents\", which I don't want to do.\r\n\r\nDo I need to re-import all 742 documents for the new project?\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment. -->\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Linux\r\n*   Python Version Used: Python 3.8\r\n*   When you install doccano: Apr 2021\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): official docker container\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
