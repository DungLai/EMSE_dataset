Here, the arrow icons are accessible to click again. Go left again wither with arrow icon or left key, accessing document ID -1. At this point, a 404 is thrown and the right arrow key won't bring you back to valid documents (for obvious reasons).\r\n\r\nSimilar behavior can be found at the max document ID. Go to last document in dataset. Right arrows are grayed out. Go right with key to access non-valid document id.
