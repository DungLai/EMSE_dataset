At its core, I believe that would mean each document is a passage, then there would be forms below (like in a Translation project) that allow you to enter in questions. Then you'd need the ability to annotate stretches of text as the answer (similar to a Sequence Labeling project). The main functionality that would be tricky would likely be tying the labels for the answer annotation back to the input questions.\r\n\r\nA naive first pass could be to replicate a combination of the SequenceLabeling+MachineTranslation UIs together. The Labels for each answer could be simply `answer-to-Q1`, `answer-to-Q2` and each document could simply have a max number of questions associated.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound doable?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/81/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":26,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/81/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
