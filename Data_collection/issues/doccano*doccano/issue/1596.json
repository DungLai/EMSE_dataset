Doccano v1.5\r\n  \r\n  I am using a Docker container to conduct NER labeling on Doccano 1.5. When I import my labels for long documents, almost all of them are there. However, some are visually missing from the GUI, usually a short consecutive sequence of them. If I assume that they are not imported by Doccano, I attempt to relabel them as I cannot see them in the GUI. However, upon refreshing the page, the original labels sometimes re-appear, in addition to my re-labeling that I do when I cannot see the original labels. So the result is, refreshing the page, I can often see something erroneously labeled 2 or 3 times because Doccano did not initially show the label as it should have.\r\n\r\nI should say that I am working with long documents. However, it may be that it is a problem resulting from the importing process. I know that Doccano somewhat loads them correctly, as the majority of the labels have no problem being accurately displayed, and refreshing the page sometimes makes the original labels re-appear. I hope this bug is fixed because it is a major blocker for usability of this version. I have had no such display issues with Doccano ~v1.2","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1596/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
