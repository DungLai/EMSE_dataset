But after some attempts I still failed to deploy doccano under some subpath. \r\n\r\nAnd I know there is another label tool named [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), it supports subpath by command like this:\r\n\r\n    $ label-studio --host https://example.com/by/subpath/of/label-studio\r\n\r\nSo I just read its code and try to change the `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` in doccano but seems not working. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/70f12eb96860709bb53c10bf1aa9e1257adef166/label_studio/core/settings/base.py#L45\r\n\r\nHere is some attemp I did: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aisensiy/doccano/commit/66b87e40e742f72dc7f494c145bb859490d4047b\r\n\r\nI really want to make doccano support the subpath.
