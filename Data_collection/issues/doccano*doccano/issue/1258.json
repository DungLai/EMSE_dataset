It works fine however for a SequenceLabeling project. I've tried several sets of numbers and letters, marking different things in UI -- no response. From what I can tell, there are no console messages (Chrome). I've tried multiple browsers (listed below), and a colleague has reproduced the problem on a different OS (listed below).\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem\r\n--------------------------\r\nCreate a standard DocumentClassification project, upload a minimal dataset, create two arbitrary labels with shortcuts.
