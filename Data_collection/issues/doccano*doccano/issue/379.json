The message \"You cannot use same label name or shortcut key.\" will then appear.\r\n\r\nThe same issue happens if you want to rename the label. For instance, try to rename the label to \"Label_1\" with a capital letter, and the same error message will appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid this issue, I have to assign an unused shortcut key to the label while I change its name and color, validate, and then change the shortcut key back to the one I want to use.\r\n\r\n**System Information**\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Windows 10\r\n*   Installed on Heroku with the Heroku button.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/379/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
