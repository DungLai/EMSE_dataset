Members\r\n- [ ]  Enable assigning a range of records to respective users directly from doccano UI by the project admin.\r\n- [ ]  Expose which member annotated which record IDs to the other annotators - like displaying an icon when they have made the change in a record ID on the top right corner, just like we see in Microsoft presentation online when multiple users work on a single PPT.\r\n\r\n2. Statistics\r\n- [ ]  Display percentage of records checked/annotated by members against the total records assigned to them.\r\n- [ ]  Any way to validate that the users have actually gone through the range of records assigned, like a check feature.\r\n\r\n3. Labels\r\n- [ ]  Displaying the record IDs against each label. For example, if I am performing Sequence Labelling, then for label PERSON, it should list down the record IDs having that label annotated.\r\n\r\n4. Comments\r\n- [ ]  Enable comments visible across all users that can eventually help clarify doubts when someone else encounters it\r\n- [ ]  Capture and Display record ID against which the comment has been provided\r\n\r\n5. Menu Visibility\r\n- [ ]  Allow annotators to visualize the stats done by them as well as others\r\n- [ ]  Allow annotators to visualize the label list\r\n\r\n6. General\r\n- [ ]  Push the `Delete All` button to the left instead of its current location. The admin might accidentally click on it when trying to click on `Projects` or Logout.\r\n- [ ]  In dark mode, when we annotated a span, it becomes completely white and can't read the text inside the span. It becomes problematic when records are pre-annotated.\r\n\r\nMore to come as I encounter.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1525/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
