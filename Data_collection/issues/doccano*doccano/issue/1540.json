It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).\r\n2. The form below must be filled out.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**:\r\n```\r\nOperating System: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)\r\nKernel: Linux 3.10.0-1160.45.1.el7.x86_64\r\nArchitecture: x86-64\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Python version**:  Python 3.9.5\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\n\r\nMy dataset has existing labels for a sequence labeling task. In this annotation scenario, the annotators are meant to verify the existing labels, and propose new ones. \r\n\r\nObserved: the UI does not show the existing labels. \r\n\r\nExpected: The UI does show them. \r\n\r\nI can reproduce this problem on doccano 1.5. \r\n\r\nOn older versions, it seems to work OK. E.g., on 1.4.1 the pre-existing labels are shown. \r\n\r\nI have reproduced this with both pip and docker. For docker, I am comparing the `doccano/doccano:1.5` image with `doccano/doccano:1.4.1` image. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the problem with the following dataset  (the sample from the UI):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"text\": \"EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.\", \"label\": [ [0, 2, \"ORG\"]]}\r\n{\"text\": \"Peter Blackburn\", \"label\": [ [0, 15, \"PERSON\"] ]}\r\n{\"text\": \"President Obama\", \"label\": [ [10, 15, \"PERSON\"] ]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the data set is loaded into version 1.4.1, the labels are shown. In 1.5, they are not shown. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1540/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
