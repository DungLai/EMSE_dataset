What I had in mind is something like this - a project with a dataset of 300 articles split into 5, assigned to 5 different annotators in the following manner: 1-60 assigned to A, 61-120 assigned to B, 121-180 assigned to C, 181-240 assigned to D, 241-300 assigned to E. \r\nI tried looking this up, but I did not find an exact answer to this question.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help in advance if anyone can chime in :)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1515/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
