But how do these lines work? I don't understand :)\r\n\r\n> And why does this patch work? We only replace `self.request.user.id` with `f(self.request.user.id)`, where `f` isn't random function. Yeah? `value = random.randrange(2, 20)` will be the the same for the same seed (`self.request.user.id`), woudn't it be?\r\n\r\nHow does this work, exactly?
