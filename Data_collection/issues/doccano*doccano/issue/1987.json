More than a year later I came back and installed the current version of doccano. \r\n\r\nAfter starting the Webserver via command line and creating a project/importing files, doccano crashes every time after some minutes (1-2 minutes). I tried different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Brave) and different versions of doccano (v1.6.0, v1.7.0, v1.8.0) and every time the same crash after some minutes. I also tried to reproduce this behaviour with extensive scrolling in the documents and clicking through the documents quickly but it seems it crashes only after some time. I also don't get any error messages in console, only browser is unresponsive and I can't refresh.\r\n\r\nIs there something I am missing?\r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce the behaviour\r\n---------\r\nDoccano crashes after a few minutes working.\r\n\r\nMy Environment\r\n---------\r\n*   Operating System: macOS 12.4\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.9.4\r\n*   When you install doccano: v1.8.0\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): pip install\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
