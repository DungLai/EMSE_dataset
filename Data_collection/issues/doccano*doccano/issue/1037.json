Thanks!\r\n\r\nOne of my projects needs to provide active learning as a service to users. I wish I could adopt the workflow of doccano in our service instead of redirecting users to a doccano endpoint. For example, if there is an annotation task, I would like to show the doccano's annotation UI on our website. (SSO integration would be sweat too.)\r\n\r\nI understand it might not be in the current roadmap, but if this feature is within the scope, I'd be happy to put engineering effort here.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1037/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
