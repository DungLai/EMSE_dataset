It was installed in the root of a newly created EC2. \r\nAfter that, I've changed the port in the docker-compose.dev.yml to 8002:8000 and in ...prod.yml to 80:80. \r\n\r\nI also changed the Inbound-Rules in the security group for my EC2. I can open the DEV with 8002 and also the PROD. \r\n\r\nBut there is a problem with the URLs. For instance, if I open a demo, I get a \r\n**GET @http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo_text_classification.js net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED** for the related JS-File. If I open the DEV with the Port 3000, everything works fine.
