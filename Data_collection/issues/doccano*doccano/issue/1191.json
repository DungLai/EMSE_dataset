This is also true for most text classification tasks, for example with sentiment classificaiton, and the possible labels negative, neutral, positive, each instance should receive one of the three labels, assigning e.g. both neutral and positive would make not sense.\r\n\r\nYet the text classification task in doccano still does not allow to restrict assignment to a single label, annotators are free to assign as many labels as they want, including all of them!\r\n\r\nThis limits the use of doccano for text classification tasks rather severely. The option to allow for any number of labels (0 to all of them) would still be good to have for multilabel classification tasks (e.g. assigning topics), but that is a much rarer annotation task in general.
