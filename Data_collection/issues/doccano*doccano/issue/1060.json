The Done / Undone filter only shows sentences in sequence labeling that have at least one annotation / no annotation. Is there such a filter? If not, what is then the purpose of checked / non checked? If no such a filtering feature, can I do the query through the DB? If yes, how?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.
