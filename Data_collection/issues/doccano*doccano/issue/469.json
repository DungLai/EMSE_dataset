I am sure the lable name is unique. I can't create the new label, if the key is blank.  It means that I can only create a new label  if the label name is unique and the key value is not empty and unique.  The key has 26 values, i can only create 26 labels.  The most  strange thing is that  I could create labels with empty key at the beginning. Then it doesn't work suddenly. Looking forward to your reply.
