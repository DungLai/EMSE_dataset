Deciding what graphics/statistics to include or not include\r\n    * balancing act between:\r\n      * graphics/statistics that are useful for everyone\r\n      * large list of graphics/statistics that are useful to some\r\n2. Design \r\n    * subjective \r\n    * keeping it simple and user friendly\r\n3. Measuring agreement \r\n    * measuring agreement is different across different annotation tasks\r\n    * how to measure agreement is difficult and/or subjective for some annotation tasks\r\n\r\nA button to download well organized data could help with (1), however, this requires an additional feature.  One solution to (3) is to only allow simple metrics that are common across all annotation tasks.\r\n\r\n## Example graphics (document classification)\r\n### Label frequency by annotator \r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13628629/54439269-d890e700-470e-11e9-9502-06a5fac58b79.PNG)\r\n### Overall agreement between annotators\r\n![Capture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13628629/54439270-d9297d80-470e-11e9-8016-e567c059b4a9.PNG)\r\n### Contingency table for two users\r\n![Capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13628629/54439271-d9297d80-470e-11e9-9c49-c304c1f18e0e.PNG)\r\n ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/114/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
