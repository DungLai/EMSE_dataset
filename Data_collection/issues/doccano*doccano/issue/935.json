Basically it is created by Django's `createsuperuser` command.\r\n- Staff can sign in to the admin site just like a superuser, but with more limited permissions. A superuser or a staff can create them on the admin site.\r\n- General users cannot sign in to the admin site, but they can create projects. A superuser or a staff can create them on the admin site.\r\n- Temporary user is a user who can neither sign in to the admin site nor create a project. This user is mainly for annotators(cloud workers). The project administrators of doccano can create them on the project members page.\r\n\r\nThe permissions per user types are as follows:\r\n\r\n  | Super User | Staff | General User | Temporary User\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nAdmin Site |   |   |   |  \r\n　Login | ✓ | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Other operations | ✓ | dependes on permissions |   |  \r\nProjectList |   |   |   |  \r\n　Create | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  \r\n　List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n\r\nThis will help resolve Issue #920. In addition, this will allow staff and general users to create projects.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\n- Within each project, the roles assigned to each user determine the permissions.\r\n- There are three roles: Administrator, Annotator, and Auditor. The auditor is the current Approver.\r\n\r\n\r\n  | Administrator | Annotator | Auditor\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nProjectDetail |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Update | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Delete | ✓ |   |  \r\nLabelList |   |   |  \r\n　Create | ✓ |   |  \r\n　List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Import | ✓ |   |  \r\nLabelDetail |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Update | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Delete | ✓ |   |  \r\nDocumentList |   |   |  \r\n　Create | ✓ |   |  \r\n　List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Import | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Export | ✓ |   |  \r\nDocumentDetail |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Update | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Delete | ✓ |   |  \r\nAnnotationList |   |   |  \r\n　Create | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\nAnnotationDetail |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Update | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\n　Delete | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\nUserList |   |   |  \r\n　List | ✓ |   |  \r\nRoeList |   |   |  \r\n　Create |   |   |  \r\n　List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓\r\nRoleMappingList |   |   |  \r\n　Create | ✓ |   |  \r\n　List | ✓ |   |  \r\nRoleMappingDetail |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Update | ✓ |   |  \r\n　Delete | ✓ |   |  \r\nStatistics |   |   |  \r\n　View | ✓ |   |  \r\nApproveLabels |   |   |  \r\n　Update | ✓ |   | ✓\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/935/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
