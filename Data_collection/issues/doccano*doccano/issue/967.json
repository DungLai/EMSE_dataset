I have a reverse proxy setup with nginx such that access to XYZ.com/doccano/ gets redirected to localhost:[port for doccano]. \r\n\r\nA simple proxy_pass does not work because the relative URLs for nuxt.js files and image files remains to be set at the root URL. In development, I was able to fix this by setting the [router base property](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-router/#base):\r\n```\r\n  2 export default {\r\n  3   mode: 'spa',\r\n  4   /*\r\n  5   ** Headers of the page\r\n  6   */\r\n  7   router: {\r\n  8     base: '/doccano/'\r\n  9   }\r\n```\r\n```\r\nsysadmin@XXX:~$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nfrontend_1  | â„¹ Listening on: http://172.21.0.3:3000/doccano/\r\n```\r\nHowever, it seems that this setting does not work for the production environment. Any help regarding base URI setup and difference between deployment in development and production are greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: 3.6\r\n*   When you install doccano: August 24\r\n*   How did you install doccano (Heroku button etc): git clone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rolzy","id":10916857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTE2ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10916857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy","html_url":"https://github.com/rolzy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolzy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
