For example:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"text\": \"Les obligations en matière d’autorisation pour les sources de rayonnements ionisants sont définies dans la norme CNEN NE 6.02 . Celle ci classe les sources de rayonnement en 10 catégories : les groupes I à III couvrent les sources scellées , les groupes IV à VIII les sources non scellées de différents types et les groupes IX et X les installations qui utilisent des accélérateurs de particules .\", \r\n\t\"labels\": [\r\n\t\t[62, 84, \"11 Occupational Health\"], \r\n\t\t[62, 73, \"11 Occupational Health\"], \r\n\t\t[159, 170, \"11 Occupational Health\"]\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, the first entity is `\"rayonnements ionisants\"` and the second one is `\"rayonnement\"`. The problem is that when I try to highlight an entity after these overlapping entities I higlight totally incorrect words. For example, I tried to highlight `dans la norme` but it highligted `6.02 . Celle` (see gif below).\r\n![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32651336/69724933-09df0500-112e-11ea-85aa-1106940697b1.gif)\r\n\r\nMoreover, you can see that it duplicates `\"rayonnements ionisants\"` because of overlapping entities. I suppose that's why it highlights wrong words.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
