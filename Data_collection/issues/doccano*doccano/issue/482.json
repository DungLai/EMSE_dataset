Then we created a new project, and wanted to import the exported data into this new project, and then each sentence in it had the original annotation of each person, but we found that we couldn't do it. \r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems that when exporting, the labeling results of all people can be exported at the same time, but when importing, either a new empty project or each sentence has a unique label through preprocessing (by giving the “labels” field a unique value). I think import and export should work together seamlessly?\r\n  This may provide users with support for merging and batch deletion of labeled data? Users can export the data to do some processing with the code, and then import it back to the annotation system again.","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
