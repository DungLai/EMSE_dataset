Once the word is highlighted in the way, if you click on any label it will not assign the label and it will deselect you selection. \r\n\r\n- This can be seen in the DEMO on your website: https://doccano.herokuapp.com/demo/named-entity-recognition/#\r\n- happens in both Chrome and Edge\r\n\r\n- You can select a single word or multiple, in either case this will fail occasionally (probably 5 in 10 times). \r\n- moving your selector from right to left also fails to tag occasionally. \r\n1. Go into the live demo on the site, select the \"The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary po...\" example\r\n2. Select the 3rd row \"Republican\" text by starting the click before the \"R\" and ending at the completion of the word\r\n3. Select the \"Person\" tag\r\n4. If this did actually annotate the word Republican as person, do not refresh the page but try again with the word \"Republican\" in the 2nd row, this should word but then when you select the word \"the\" in the second row and try to assign it to the tag \"Person\", this should fail\r\n\r\n- double clicking seems to mostly work but does also fail \r\n1. Go into the live demo on the site, select the \"The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary po...\" example\r\n2. Select the 3rd row \"Republican\" text by double clicking the word\r\n3. Select the \"Event\" tag, this should work\r\n4. select 2nd row \"Republican\" by double clicking\r\n5. Select the \"Event\" tag, this should work\r\n6. now select the word \"the\" in the 2nd row by double clicking\r\n7. try to assign it the tag of \"Event\" and this should fail\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n- LIVE DEMO page on Doccano website\r\n- also saw failures with personal data, Docker load, V1.0.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
