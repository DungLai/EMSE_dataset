I then exported the data to do some analytics and found out that the order in which the data is exported does not correspond to the order in the annotation tool, even though the project never had the randomization option turned on. I updated Doccano to the lastest release (1.0.5) today and exported again, only to find that this second export had a different order from the first export. \r\n\r\nChecking some samples did not reveal a consistent pattern (offset +/- X, etc.). This seemed unfortunate, since this would break the ability to export data, process it and then go back to doccano and pull up specific datapoints for revision/curation.\r\n\r\nA sanity check of the ascending document IDs then showed that the order in the Docanno interface is based on the ascending \"id\" field, which fortunately is not a GUID. In the export, however, this ordering seems to not be maintained. After reordering the export according to the \"id\" field, the order matches that in the editor and allows for going and back and checking data points. \r\n\r\nWhile reordering after export is a functioning workaround, I presume this behavior is not intended and hence am filing it as a bug.\r\n\r\nYour Environment\r\n---------\r\n<!-- Include details of your environment.-->\r\n*   Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n*   Python Version Used: default as per docker config\r\n*   When you install doccano:\r\nEarly July 2020, update to latest release on July 23\r\n*   How did you install doccano:\r\nLocal `docker-compose` deployment\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Hironsan","id":6737785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzc3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6737785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan","html_url":"https://github.com/Hironsan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hironsan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/929/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
