I  created  a project in doccano project page using **create project** .\r\n2. Then created  new user or annotator in admin page using **add user** and gave only active and staff status permissions to that user.\r\n3. I also created role in admin page with **annotator** name.\r\n4. And then create  role map  using **add role mapping** for user with role name for a specific project and then logout from admin page.\r\n5. After i login to doccano page using admin credentials. There is no projects  in **http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx/projects/**   and also no **create project** button at the top of the project list.\r\n6. I also observed one this , before role mapping  **http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx/projects/**  contain some welcome message like **HELLO,Admin.** but after role mapping that becomes like **HELLO, .** , Admin replaced with empty string.\r\n7. And one more thing i can able to access and annotate project from **http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx/projects/4/** here 4 is the project_id but  in this link **http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx/projects/** number of projects are zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore adding annotators , i have 4 projects in **http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx/projects/** \r\n\r\nPlease anyone suggest me whatever steps i have to follow or how  to fix this problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
