I havent done any review but wanted to know if theres any documentation on maximum length of file or any other info on the uploader.\r\n\r\nEDIT: After looking for the parser I found there seems to be a 500 lines limit in the plain text data parser.(I think...)\r\nGonna keep looking for now.\r\n\r\nBTW isnt better to upload the file and then do the parsing in app side? Instead of streaming the data through the request?? Just asking, I dont actually know the answer to this question.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: Just figured it out, I had spaces between lines in my text file. Data cleaning is always out to get you...\r\n\r\nHowever would be interesting to upload the files as is to the server and then manage them in server side, through the admin portal.","closed_by":{"login":"repollo","id":2671466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzE0NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2671466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo","html_url":"https://github.com/repollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/repollo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
