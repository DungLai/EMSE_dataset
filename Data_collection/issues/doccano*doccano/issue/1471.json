I implemented a work around here: \r\nhttps://github.com/kaapana/kaapana/tree/develop/services/applications/doccano/docker/doccano-frontend\r\n\r\nwhere I needed to adapt serval files. Since this feature might be interesting for others, too, I am working on a forked repo on a general integration: https://github.com/klauskades/doccano/tree/feature/prefix_url . I would be happy to discuss about the current implementation and discuss further adjustments. One issue that I face is the loading of images. But I am not sure if this is already covered without issues in the default version. Also I am not sure which ways of running the system should be supported. Currently, I was working with the docker-compose.prod.yml and by starting the services locally.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback!\r\n\r\nBest Klaus\r\n\r\n\r\n   ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
