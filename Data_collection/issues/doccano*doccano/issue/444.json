Under `/projects/`, we can see the greeting banner, the teal project creation button, and \"0 projects\" listed. \r\n\r\nOur issue begins when we try to create a new project. We can see the modal window where a user enters the project name, description, type, and can check the option boxes. However, clicking \"Create\" results in a 403 Forbidden error visible in the browser console. No visible changes are propagated in the Doccano GUI.\r\n\r\nThe README.md lists the following steps with screenshots:\r\n\r\n* Confirm all doccano services are running\r\n* Create a project\r\n\r\nbut does not provide information on troubleshooting should something not function as expected.\r\n\r\nWe might have something incorrectly configured, but we are unsure of where to look and what to adjust. We can post configs and logs as needed.
