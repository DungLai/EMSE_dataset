Create a dataset of 2 documents with a meta field\r\n2. Add a label to only one document\r\n3. Export the dataset\r\n\r\nAs a result, the meta field will be present only for the document with a label. However, it's a common situation when some documents don't have any labels. And it's a very good practice to feet models with documents with and without labels to get a good perf.  And the meta field is the only way to do the relation between the documents extracted from the doccano and the original dataset. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting point is that if you add the label for both documents, all of them will have the meta field. And then if you remove labels and run the export again, this field disappears \r\n\r\n<!-- Include a code example or the steps that led to the problem.
