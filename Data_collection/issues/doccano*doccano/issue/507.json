I imported about 500 _automatically pre-labelled_ documents and started annotating.\r\n2. After annotating quite a few, I realized I was stupid and there's a lot of near-duplicates and gibberish.\r\n3. I decided to delete the remaining (not yet annotated) documents and replace them with new ones. That's where I got stuck.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\n\r\nI'm unable to delete a specific subset of the documents when using pre-labelling.\r\n\r\n**What I tried**\r\n\r\n- Filters - _Undone_ filter shows only docs without any annotation, so not useful for my case.\r\n- _Dataset_ listing - select all and uncheck the first _N_ documents. Unfortunately, it seems that they don't reliably keep their order in the listing and therefore I might accidentally delete the done docs. \r\n- Django Admin - didn't find anything helpful concerning document order\r\n- _Checked / Not checked_ button - unfortunately, the status doesn't show anywhere, neither in the UI nor in Django admin.\r\n\r\nActually what would easily solve my problem would be a simple \"delete this document\" button from document detail view - it wouldn't disturb the workflow and it would make sure that I'm actually deleting the document I want to delete.\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for looking at this! \r\n\r\nLukas\r\n\r\n**System Info**\r\n\r\nBasic Ubuntu 18 image on AWS, freshly installed through docker-compose a few days ago.","closed_by":{"login":"icoxfog417","id":544269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDI2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417","html_url":"https://github.com/icoxfog417","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icoxfog417/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
