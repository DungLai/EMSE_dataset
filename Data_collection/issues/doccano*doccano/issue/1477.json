What specific solution would you like? -->\r\n\r\nHi guys, I'm a new doccano's user, so, I don't know if there's a way to do that currently.\r\n\r\nI'm a Data Scientist that works with NLP projects and is very common to have more than one task in the same dataset. I want to use Doccano to manage my data labeling step, but it's required that I created one project for each task. Let me explain with an example:\r\n\r\nText message: **\"This is a stupid example, so thank you for nothing a!@#!@.\"**\r\n\r\nFor this text message, I can have several tasks.\r\n\r\n- It's offensive or not? (Yes/No) - Binary classification\r\n- What words suggest an offensive? - Sequence to Sequence\r\n- The offensive is targeted at someone? - Binary classification\r\n- The offensive target is an individual, group, or other? - Multi-class classification\r\n\r\nI want to avoid create different projects and manage them individually because I want the same person labeling all the tasks at the same moment.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1477/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doccano/doccano/issues/1477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
