It helped.\r\n\r\nBut I reproduced it synthetically:\r\n1. Add `a_user` as an `annotator` of `a_project`.\r\n2. Sign in to Django Admin.\r\n3. Go to `Projects` page.\r\n4. Go to `a_project`'s page.\r\n5. On `Users` field, deselect `a_user` item.\r\n6. Click `Save`.\r\n\r\nNow:  _user `a_user` is an `annotator` at `a_project`'s Members page; but `a_user` doesn't see `a_project` at his Projects page_.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n1. Where and how is list from p.5 stored?\r\n2.
