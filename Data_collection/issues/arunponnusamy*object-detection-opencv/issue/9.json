I understand that the DNN module provided here is just for running the images. But in case I want to train the model and check the outcome myself. Or to put it in a better way; what if I would want to make changes to the existing YOLO model to either improve the results. How do I approach? Could you please suggest on how to go about?","closed_by":{"login":"shrybht","id":43078989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDc4OTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43078989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht","html_url":"https://github.com/shrybht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrybht/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arunponnusamy/object-detection-opencv/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/arunponnusamy/object-detection-opencv/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
