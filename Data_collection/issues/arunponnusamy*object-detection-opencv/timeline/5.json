These steps are found to improve the training process.\r\n\r\nSo in YOLO v3, the images are normalized (converting pixel values to range from 0 to 1) before passing through the network. So this scale value 0.00392 is nothing but 1/255. Dividing each pixel value by 255 (which is  equivalent to multiplying with 0.00392) brings them to the range of 0 to 1. \r\n\r\nThese steps are decided by the authors of the network. Different research papers propose different preprocessing steps which they find working well. So this scaling is essentially a preprocessing step. Hope this is clear now.
