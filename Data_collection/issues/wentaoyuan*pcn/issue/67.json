Regardless the version of TF, Cuda, and the rest, and also in the most updated ones, I keep getting this error. From my understanding, I assume that this error should pop up with updated versions of tensorflow and etc, but I get it in all the tries I have done no matter what. \r\nI see this can be done [registering the operations via C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/create_op ), with the proper implementation of `SetShapeFn`, but I don't understand how and what parameters to make it. It's strange that I haven't found any implementation to fix this and I am having trouble doing it as well. \r\nAny ideas? \r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"demo.py\", line 121, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"demo.py\", line 77, in main\r\n    model_module = importlib.import_module('.%s' % args.model_type, 'models')\r\n  File \"/home/mario/anaconda3/envs/pcnconda/lib/python3.6/importlib/__init__.py\", line 126, in import_module\r\n    return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 994, in _gcd_import\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 971, in _find_and_load\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 955, in _find_and_load_unlocked\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 665, in _load_unlocked\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\", line 678, in exec_module\r\n  File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 219, in _call_with_frames_removed\r\n  File \"/home/mario/Downloads/pcn-master/models/pcn_cd.py\", line 26, in <module>\r\n    from tf_util import *\r\n  File \"/home/mario/Downloads/pcn-master/tf_util.py\", line 26, in <module>\r\n    from pc_distance import tf_nndistance, tf_approxmatch\r\n  File \"/home/mario/Downloads/pcn-master/pc_distance/tf_approxmatch.py\", line 21, in <module>\r\n    @ops.RegisterShape('ApproxMatch')\r\nAttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops' has no attribute 'RegisterShape'\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"MarioCavero","id":23640690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQwNjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23640690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero","html_url":"https://github.com/MarioCavero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioCavero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
