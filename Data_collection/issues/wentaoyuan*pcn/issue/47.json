My environment is windows10+Tensorflow1.13.1+cuda10.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, when i follow the instructions to build the .c & .cu code under pc_distance directory using make, i am caught up with a compiling bug as follows:\r\ncannot find -ltensorflow_framework \\ collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\nAnd in makefile, there is a line of code relate to this bug: -L $(tf_lib) -ltensorflow_framework\r\nI googled this bug and someone says it might be related to the absence of lib file libtensorflow_framework.so. However, i searched thorough my tensorflow folder and even the whole anaconda folder, but cannot find such lib file named \"libtensorflow_framework.so\". And also someone says this lib file has been removed in the newer version of tensorflow. So i am wondered whether this bug may be caused by the version difference since Tensorflow1.12 is used to build this code rather than Tensorflow1.13.1 which i use. If so, could i do any modifications in makefile to solve this problem. Or maybe my wrong path assignment in makefile results in this bug? Any helpful replies is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
