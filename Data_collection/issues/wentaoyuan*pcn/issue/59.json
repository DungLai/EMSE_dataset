After I running the command `./mesh_sampling -h`, it shows that `-n_samples` is the option of the number of points to sample. But When I run the command `./mesh_sampling input.obj output.pcd -n_samples 16384`, it cannot generate 16384 points in the output pcd file. Generally, the number of points in output point cloud is less than I want. The ground truth you mentioned in paper has 16384 points. How do you get 16384 points by this tool?\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\r\n* GCC 7.5.0\r\n* VTK 9.0.1","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/59/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
