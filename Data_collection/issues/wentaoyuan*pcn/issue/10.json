From README .md, the instruction is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Create a model list. Each line of the model list should be in the format `[synset_id]/[model_id]`.\r\n- Run `blender -b -P render_depth.py [ShapeNet directory] [model list] [output directory] [num scans per model]` to render the depth images. The images will be stored in OpenEXR format. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am quite confused about the format of the 'model list' and the 'ShapeNet directory'. Would you mind providing me with an easy example to show how it really looks like? Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"wentaoyuan","id":7258482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTg0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7258482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/wentaoyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
