From lmdb_writer.py, I found that only a single complete point cloud will be read while num_scan (e.g. 8) partial point cloud will be read. Under this circumstance, if I understand correctly, partial point cloud in different viewing angles will be completed using the same ground truth. Normally, during training, different input should refer to their own corresponding output, right? My question is that why we don't need to do the point cloud registration to align the completed point cloud with the partial point cloud first. \r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you.
