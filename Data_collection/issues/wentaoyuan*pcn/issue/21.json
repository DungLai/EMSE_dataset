But seems like the results are quite noisy and in low resolution (compared to the ones in the `./shapenet/test/` on [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Af9igOStb6O9YHwjYHOwR0qW4uP3zLA6)). \r\n\r\nAs shown in the figure below, the upper one (purple airplane) is my rendering result, and the lower one (blue airplane) is the result from your dataset (`./shapenet/test/partial/02691156/6ca6c7920c62773073d96deff5ddb8e5.pcd`). My points are less than yours (245 points vs 1992 points) and much more noisy from another angle of view. Is it because the partial point clouds in the testset are generated from a different set of camera intrinsic (other than width:160 height:120 with focal:100)? Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8606221/53608274-e6733380-3b76-11e9-86f0-68972664b3e4.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8606221/53608481-c1cb8b80-3b77-11e9-9d89-2b298384c361.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[mine-02691156-6ca6c7920c62773073d96deff5ddb8e5.txt](https://github.com/TonythePlaneswalker/pcn/files/2917455/mine-02691156-6ca6c7920c62773073d96deff5ddb8e5.txt)\r\n\r\n[pcn-6ca6c7920c62773073d96deff5ddb8e5.txt](https://github.com/TonythePlaneswalker/pcn/files/2917456/pcn-6ca6c7920c62773073d96deff5ddb8e5.txt)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
