recently i am working on reproducing this PCN. My environment is windows10+Tensorflow1.13.1+cuda10.0.  However, when i follow the instructions to build the .c & .cu code under pc_distance directory using make, i am caught up with a compiling bug as follows:\r\n`cannot find -ltensorflow_framework \\ collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status`\r\n\r\nAnd i modified the makefile path as follows:\r\ncuda_inc = \"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/include/\"\r\ncuda_lib = \"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/lib/x64/\"\r\nnvcc = \"C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/bin/nvcc\"\r\ntf_inc1 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include\" \r\ntf_inc2 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/google/protobuf_archive/src\" \r\ntf_inc3 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/include/external/com_google_absl\" \r\ntf_inc4 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/eigen3\" \r\ntf_inc5 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/include/external/eigen_archive\"\r\ntf_lib1 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow\"\r\ntf_lib2 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/core/lib\"\r\ntf_lib3 = \"D:/Anaconda3/envs/pcn/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/stream_executor/lib\"\r\n\r\nSo i was wondered whether it is my wrong path assignment that results in my bug or any other mistakes.  So could you share me with your successful path assignment? Or maybe the difference between TensorFlow version counts since yours is 1.14 and mine is 1.13.  Any helpful advice is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/comments/586800166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StevenZzz07","id":56421441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIxNDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56421441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenZzz07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenZzz07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
