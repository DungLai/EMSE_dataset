This work assumes the partial point clouds are aligned in a canonical coordinates (you can think of them being \"registered\"). Specifically, if the partial point clouds are created from depth scans, they are transformed into the world coordinates (coordinates of the original CAD model). Thus, partial point clouds from different views should correspond to the same complete point clouds.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you can still train the model using unaligned point clouds. As the network is learning a direct mapping via a joint feature space, it does not require the input and the output to correspond.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/comments/446236314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wentaoyuan","id":7258482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTg0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7258482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/wentaoyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wentaoyuan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/comments/446242888","html_url":"https://github.com/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/11#issuecomment-446242888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/11","id":446242888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjI0Mjg4OA==","user":{"login":"powenlo","id":36663851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjYzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36663851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo","html_url":"https://github.com/powenlo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powenlo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-11T15:27:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T15:27:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your prompt reply.
