However, since the test data are removed due to completion3d, can you report CD on the ShapeNet validation set? Moreover, it seems to be relatively slow to train, about 1.2s/batch on one GTX2080Ti. Can you also report the training speed or training time for ShapeNet?\r\n\r\nhi, did you use the tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0 or tensorflow==1.12.0 ï¼Ÿ i dont konw why my train process not use gpu,thank you so much","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wentaoyuan/pcn/issues/comments/986518697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Skye2099","id":56715553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzE1NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56715553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099","html_url":"https://github.com/Skye2099","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skye2099/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
