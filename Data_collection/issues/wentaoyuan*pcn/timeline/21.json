Here[(pcn_render.zip)](https://github.com/TonythePlaneswalker/pcn/files/2921343/pcn_render.zip) is the minimal system for this test (I only fixed the pose angle and changed the resolution for the depth map). There are some pre-generated figures under `./figs`. Or if you want to run it, first use `blender -b -P render_depth.py shapenet_lite ./model.list ./tmp 1` then `python3 process_exr.py model.list ./tmp/intrinsics.txt ./tmp 1`. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis time I ran it with the resolution as you suggested (`width = 320`, `height = 240` and `focal = 200`) and got 1032 points. The following figures are the mesh model, and then the pcl visualizations for the same two point clouds but from different angles (The red one was generated from this python code, and the green one was fetched from the test dataset in google drive)\r\n\r\nNotice that there are many noisy points in the red point clouds-\"noisy\" means they are not belong to the mesh surfaces. One of the possible reason is that they are lying on the boundary of the 2d depth images, and due to some numerical reason, they are not back-projected to the right place in 3d space. But I just wonder why this did not happen in the green point clouds. Do you use any post-processing methods (like filtering or outlier detection, or re-sampling from multiple pointclouds) for that? Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n![aero-mesh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8606221/53671043-a58c2500-3c31-11e9-8d02-8a40bd8c190a.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2019-03-01
