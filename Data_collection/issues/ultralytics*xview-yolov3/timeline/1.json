I used 30 anchors (compared to 9 in yolov3) because I've read that in general higher anchor counts correlate to higher mAPs. Here is an example from http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection/\r\n![number-of-centroids 2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/44807254-5f460280-abc9-11e8-8891-4daf39e1efb3.png)\r\n\r\n2. I actually achieved the best results with c60_a30.cfg, but I reasoned that since this is overhead imagery, if you had infinite examples of each class, the anchor boxes should be vertical-horizontal symmetric, so to force this idea I duplicated the data, transposing the boxes in the duplicated set, before doing kmeans for the 'symmetric' cfg files. In the end its probably much to do about nothing though, as the two cfg files ended up being very similar to each other (symmetric and non-symmetric). I doubt your results will change materially depending on which you use, but if you want to duplicate my results use c60_a30.cfg.\r\n\r\n3. Yes, the eriklindernoren repo was great for inference but did not train correctly, so I modified the cost functions in `models.py` and `build_targets()` in `detect.py`. I also essentially rewrote much of datasets.py, switching it from PIL to opencv, and adding augmentation, which of course is necessary for training but not inference.\r\n\r\n4. I use a weighted loss for the classification loss term, so buildings and cars for example are much less important. The weight is the inverse of the class frequency. In `utils.py` you'll find the weights as a lookup table. The numbers here are the number of occurances of each class in the dataset. The weights are their inverses, normalized to sum to 1.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndef xview_class_weights(indices):  # weights of each class in the training set, normalized to mu = 1\r\n    weights = 1 / torch.FloatTensor(\r\n        [74, 364, 713, 71, 2925, 209767, 6925, 1101, 3612, 12134, 5871, 3640, 860, 4062, 895, 149, 174, 17, 1624, 1846, 125, 122, 124, 662, 1452, 697, 222, 190, 786, 200, 450, 295, 79, 205, 156, 181, 70, 64, 337, 1352, 336, 78, 628, 841, 287, 83, 702, 1177, 313865, 195, 1081, 882, 1059, 4175, 123, 1700, 2317, 1579, 368, 85])\r\n    weights /= weights.sum()\r\n    return weights[indices]\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Yes, there is significant data augmentation in `datasets.py`: both spatial augmentation (translation, rotation, skew, zoom, flipping), and lighting augmentation (variation of the SV channels when the RGB image is projected to HSV). Bounding boxes are automatically augmented along with the image. Note that the lighting augmentation actually hurt the results on xview however. The mAP dropped from 0.16 to 0.12 when I used it. Also note that rotating bounding boxes can get a bit dicey at rotation angles around 45 degrees, as the box may become much larger about the object than desireable.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the results, you should just be able to start training. You should notice right away after a few epochs if the results are similar, as the results posted to results.txt should match the image on the repo home page. You can use `plotResults()` in `utils.py` to plot your results.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/comments/417060500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1816413376,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgxNjQxMzM3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/events/1816413376","actor":{"login":"PiggyGenius","id":18380206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgwMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18380206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius","html_url":"https://github.com/PiggyGenius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-29T18:38:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1816413377,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MTY0MTMzNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/events/1816413377","actor":{"login":"PiggyGenius","id":18380206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgwMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18380206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius","html_url":"https://github.com/PiggyGenius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiggyGenius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-29T18:38:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/comments/439519062","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/1#issuecomment-439519062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/1","id":439519062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTUxOTA2Mg==","user":{"login":"abidmalikwaterloo","id":447056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzA1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/447056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo","html_url":"https://github.com/abidmalikwaterloo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abidmalikwaterloo/received_

There are many ways to do this. The purpose of the function you see there is to use arbitrary class numbers. You do not need to use this if your classes are ordered simply, such as 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. In xview the classes skip numbers, i.e. 5, 6, 17, 20,

I want to use resized xview images,. like, decrease their resolution first and then use your model with it. I think, you are cropping the patches from the original images which are of around 3k x 3k. I want to do the same with 1000 x 1000 sized images. Please help.
