Please note that this repository is no longer actively maintained. Instead we recommend all users start from [github.com/ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) and adapt it to their specific needs.\r\n\r\nThe `target_c60.mat` file you mentioned can be read by `scipy.io`, however it was generated by a seperate MATLAB script, which mainly trims poor labels and creates a k-means anchors from the remaining good candidates.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/blob/9d30dabaeccf7937d2e66dca7324890d65e1799b/utils/analysis.m#L79\r\n\r\nIn order to adapt [github.com/ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) to geospatial data similar to xview you mainly need to implement the sliding window inference and chip training, and ideally also do a k-means search of your anchors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/comments/495573500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2365156567,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2NTE1NjU2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/events/2365156567","actor":{"login":"sawhney-medha","id":24471303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDcxMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24471303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha","html_url":"https://github.com/sawhney-medha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-24T10:56:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2365156568,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjUxNTY1Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/events/2365156568","actor":{"login":"sawhney-medha","id":24471303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDcxMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24471303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha","html_url":"https://github.com/sawhney-medha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-24T10:56:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/comments/495578531","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/13#issuecomment-495578531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/13","id":495578531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTU3ODUzMQ==","user":{"login":"sawhney-medha","id":24471303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDcxMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24471303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha","html_url":"https://github.com/sawhney-medha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sawhney-medha/rec
