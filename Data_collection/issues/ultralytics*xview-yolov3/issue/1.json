I have a few questions:\r\n   1. Why do use 30 anchors ? Did you run some analysis or what is your intuition ?\r\n   2. I noticed that you have multiple cfg files but that your 30 anchors symmetric is the default one in train so I figure it is the one that gave you the best results ? What size should my input be to use your cfg file correctly ?\r\n   3. I know you started working using the repo of eriklindernoren, can you mention the major changes you did on the training process (or other) so that I know what to pay attention to ?\r\n   4. I haven't looked at everything yet but from my first look you don't seem to use a loss that emphasize mistakes on xview classes that are not well represented. How do you deal with the fact that building and small car make up a huge part of the dataset ? My network only learns to predict these two classes.\r\n   5. I haven't noticed any data augmentation, do you use any ?\r\n\r\nFinally if you can mention/explain anything that you think could help someone reproduce your results it would be really helpful !","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/1/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/xview-yolov3/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
