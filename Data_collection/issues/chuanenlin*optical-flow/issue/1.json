Could you please suggest how do I track a set of detected objects (multiple objects per frame) using object detection methods using this approach. What is the change I should be making in the goodFeaturesToTrack function to get the prev variable value updated as mentioned in the blog? Any sort of help would be useful. \r\n\r\nThank You","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chuanenlin/optical-flow/issues/1/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chuanenlin/optical-flow/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
