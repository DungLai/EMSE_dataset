Then I printed the scores. I thought the scores were from 0 to 5 where 5 representing most similar but when I printed them I found that some of the similarity scores were negative. Can you clarify what is the range of similarity score.\r\nAnother problem I am getting is that the test results change if I run the model again( I am not training the model, I am just predicting the test set). I thought it was due to the dropout, so I made the dropout 0 but I am still getting different results every time I ran it.\r\nI even saw that you have used self.network.eval() which makes the network in testing mode thus even if there is any dropout layer then it ignores it.","closed_by":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
