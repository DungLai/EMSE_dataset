In each epoch, a\r\nmini-batch b_t\r\nis selected(e.g., among all 9 GLUE\r\ntasks), and the model is updated according to the\r\ntask-specific objective for the task t. This approximately optimizes the sum of all multi-task objectives.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, in your code this multi-task fine-tuning stage is called `MTL refinement`. Then why do you fine-tune for each task in single task setting in your `fine-tuning` stage? There is no such stage in the original paper.\r\nAlso, in `run_mt_dnn.sh` there are lines:\r\n`train_datasets=\"mnli,rte,qqp,qnli,mrpc,sst,cola,stsb\"\r\ntest_datasets=\"mnli_matched,mnli_mismatched,rte\"`\r\nWhy do you only test on `mnli` and `rte` and not test on all other tasks?\r\nI would also like to ask if I can switch from `BERT large` to `BERT base` there because i only have one 1080 GTX card.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/7/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
