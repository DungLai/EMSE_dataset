Thanks for your time. \r\n\r\nSo I have an intro question about the model. \r\n\r\nSo this model takes a pretrained BERT model and then jointly fine tunes it on 4 tasks: single sentence classification, pairwise text similarity, pairwise text classification and pairwise ranking.\r\nFor pairwise text classification it has an additional stochastic answer network attached to the head but for the other three tasks it just attaches the specific loss function for the three tasks.\r\n\r\nThe whole network is trained end to end.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help and God bless!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
