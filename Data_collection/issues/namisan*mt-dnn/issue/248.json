I have cloned the repository onto my hard drive but when I try to install with pip I get an error to the effect that pip cannot find version 1.5.0 of pytorch - the earliest available is 1.7.0.  Does it need to be 1.5.0 or can I tweak requirements.txt to choose a different version and if so, which version should be used?  Many thanks for your support.
