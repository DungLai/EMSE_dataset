Such behavior seems strange to me, considering the fact that MNLI has most examples throughout the GLUE dataset. Could you please explain, what is the benefit of not using some of the examples from smaller datasets on each epoch?\r\nThank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
