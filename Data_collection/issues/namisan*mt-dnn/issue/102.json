It is not clear what we should put here: <bert/ner-model> . To my understadning, here ``` --train_dataset ner --test_dataset ner ``` where ```ner``` we should put the filename.\r\n\r\n2) When running the command, what will happen? It will train NER as single task, using the shared layers that have been trained with the multitask?\r\n\r\nMy intention is to adapt it for a different sequence labeling task, from NER, and to use multitask learning for that.\r\n\r\nCould you please help me understand?\r\nThanks\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
