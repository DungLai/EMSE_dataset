But could I train jointly a task of one folder with a task of another folder?  An example is to train \r\n``` mnli ``` from glue_task_def.yml in glue/, with ``` ner ``` from ner_task_def.yml in ner/\r\n(or specifically for my case, a different sequence labeling task instead of ner)\r\n\r\nIs this supported?
