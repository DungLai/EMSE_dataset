@phosseini \r\nyes, I found an answer by myself. \r\nThere are .yml files, for each folder. For example:\r\nhttps://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn/blob/master/experiments/glue/glue_task_def.yml\r\nor\r\nhttps://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn/blob/master/experiments/ner/ner_task_def.yml\r\nor\r\nhttps://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn/blob/master/experiments/squad/squad_task_def.yml\r\n\r\nYou can copy-paste definitions from one .yml to another, and in that way to add a new task in your available tasks for training, etc. Or you can just merge those .yml files into one.\r\n\r\nThen you can edit for example\r\nhttps://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn/blob/master/scripts/run_mt_dnn.sh\r\nand put here:\r\ntrain_datasets=\"mnli,rte,qqp,qnli,mrpc,sst,cola,stsb\"\r\nthe list of tasks you want. Now you can add without problem, your tasks from squad or ner etc.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me if you need extra clarifications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/comments/598142093/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antgr","id":2175768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzU3Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2175768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr","html_url":"https://github.com/antgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antgr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3122483963,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEyMjQ4Mzk2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/events/3122483963","actor":{"login":"phosseini","id":25105263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA1MjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25105263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini","html_url":"https://github.com/phosseini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T11:42:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3122483966,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMjI0ODM5NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/events/3122483966","actor":{"login":"phosseini","id":25105263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA1MjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25105263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini","html_url":"https://github.com/phosseini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phosseini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T11:42:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3122496976,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEyMjQ5Njk3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/events/3122496976","actor":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan","html_url":"https://github.com/namisan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namisan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T11:46:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3122496979,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMjI0OTY5Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/namisan/mt-dnn/issues/events/3122496979","actor":{"login":"namisan","id":3060273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjAyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3060273?v=
