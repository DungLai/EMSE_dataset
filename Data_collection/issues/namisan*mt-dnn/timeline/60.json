Is there any way to load the model after training and classify based on the task-specific dense layers (I assume for each task a specific dense layer is learned for classification) or are these not stored with the model.pt file and lost? E.g. if one wants to predict classes for samples of an unseen dataset on the, let's say, specific MNLI dense layer.\r\n\r\n**_Did you found the way to run specific task on mt-dnn. For example if I just want to run single sentence classification task on CoLa dataset.
