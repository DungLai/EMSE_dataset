So you will need to provide heatpaf1.pkl by yourself or run 'test.py' in which network has already provided keypoints and paf. And the code of 'estimator.py' is from  https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation but I can't find the 'heatpaf1.pkl' in this repo. So you can ask the author of the 'estimator.py' for 'heatpaf1.pkl' or make it yourself or just run 'test.py' which call estimator as a part. btw, I'm curious about why you want to run 'estimator.py'.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/comments/456052833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YangZeyu95","id":28431121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDMxMTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28431121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95","html_url":"https://github.com/YangZeyu95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/comments/457073768","html_url":"https://github.com/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/11#issuecomment-457073768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/11","id":457073768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzA3Mzc2OA==","user":{"login":"gouyinchao","id":38322578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzIyNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38322578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao","html_url":"https://github.com/gouyinchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gouyinchao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T05:40:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T05:40:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
