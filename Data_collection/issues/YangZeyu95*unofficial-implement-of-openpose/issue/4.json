My task is to detect the seven visible vertices of the cube. When I prepared the data set according to the COCO format, I found that the function in pose_dataset.py reported an error. After testing, I found that COCO keypoints dataset has 17 keypoints. but cube only have 7, so I want to know how to modify the pose_dataset.py  so that I can solve it.
