Can i improve the model performance by training more epochs and what about the learning rate set? Could you give me some advice, thank you so much.","closed_by":{"login":"YangZeyu95","id":28431121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDMxMTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28431121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95","html_url":"https://github.com/YangZeyu95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangZeyu95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YangZeyu95/unofficial-implement-of-openpose/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
