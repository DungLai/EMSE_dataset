The required amount of training data depends on how challenging the problem is. Are the scans noisy or clean? Is there a clear boundary delineating the desired object(s)? What is the biological variation in the anatomy? Is there variation in the way the scan is done (positioning, settings, scanner)? The harder the problem is, the more training data you need. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to split fifty-fifty while you play a bit with the method. And then when you are ready to make a proper validation, you should consider a five-fold cross-validation (allowing you to train on 25 scans instead of the 15 given by a fifty-fifty split).

and thank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n- Are you getting a TensorFlow memory error? Otherwise, I suspect you may be running out of RAM. The fusion training process is quite memory consuming when processing large images. Please see below.\r\n- How much RAM does your system have?\r\n- How big are the sampled images? Please refer to the 'dim' parameter under 'build' in the train_hparams.yaml file, or in the training log files.\r\n\r\nThe train_fusion script is quite primitive at this point. I am currently re-writing it to help prevent issues like those you are experiencing. For now, I suggest you either reduce the images_per_round parameter to 1 and see if that fixes your issue. Alternatively, you may skip fusion training entirely by invoking the prediction script with the --sum_fusion flag (note that this will reduce performance). E.g.:\r\n\r\nmp predict --sum_fusion\r\n\r\nThe memory usage of predicting without fusion is, however, roughly equal to running train_fusion with 1 image per round.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMathias","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/comments/516754812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"perslev","id":12041524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQxNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12041524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/comments/516758198","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/1#issuecomment-516758198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/1","id":516758198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjc1ODE5OA==","user":{"login":"mnc1423","id":41675771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjc1Nzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41675771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423","html_url":"https://github.com/mnc1423","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnc1423/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T08:48:10Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T08:48:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey perslev!

I assume you were able to run training successfully on this system? The problem in that case, as you mentioned, could be that the fusion model although small in size is trained with a very large batch size, and is placed on the same GPU next to the UNet.\r\n\r\nPlease pull the latest repository and checkout on branch 'v.0.2.2' and try re-running the fusion script. It now accepts a --batch_size parameter, which you can decrease until you no longer experience the error. The default value for batch_size has also been decreased significantly, so you may not have to manually set the parameter at all.\r\n\r\nThese changes will be merged with the master branch at a later
