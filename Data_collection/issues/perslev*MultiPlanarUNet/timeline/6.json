E.g. if you want to use GPU with identifier '0' - no matter its current status - you would set --force GPU 0. In many cases you won't have to use the --force_GPU flag as an available GPU is automatically selected. However, if you have other applications using the GPU it can be necessary to set the --force_GPU flag.\r\n\r\nThe MemoryError seems to occur when loading your data. Maybe your dataset is too large to fit in your computers RAM. How large is the dataset and how much memory does your computer have?\r\n\r\nCurrently, MultiPlanarUNet loads all data into memory before training. There is no functionality for streaming data from disk. However, let me know if this would be of interest, then I might add it in the future.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMathias","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/comments/552104771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"perslev","id":12041524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQxNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12041524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/comments/552104824","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/6#issuecomment-552104824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/6","id":552104824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjEwNDgyNA==","user":{"login":"perslev","id":12041524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQxNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12041524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-09T14:20:01Z","updated_at":"2019-11-09T14:20:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"In
