I.e., if `real_space_span = 100` and the image dimension is `dim = 200`, then 200 pixels are to be sampled to span 100 millimetres of space giving a pixel size of 0.5mm.\r\n\r\nIt is heuristically calculated as the 75th percentile of sizes of all training images (i.e., the extent of the images in scanner space).
