I just have one confusion about a small part of the codes in predict.py.\r\n\r\nin the `run_predictions_and_eval` function, before iterating images from `image_pair_dict`, why do we need to run `predict_single` over `image_pair_loader.images[0]`, at line 425? That just seems to be a useless step because you iterate over all images in the `for` loop right after it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"perslev","id":12041524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQxNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12041524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev","html_url":"https://github.com/perslev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perslev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/perslev/MultiPlanarUNet/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
