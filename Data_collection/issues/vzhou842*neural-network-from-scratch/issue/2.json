I am looking into modularizing my code a bit and keep stumbling across a problem. First, am I understanding this line correctly:\r\nhttps://github.com/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch/blob/498631c08c2ca8c37107c1f8f6f18fee393e7dde/network.py#L73\r\n\r\nIs this the derivative of the cost function (MSE in this tutorial), or how does one end up here?\r\nDoes that mean, that a cost function must always exist as it's \"forward\" form and as it's backward(derived) from? (The later being used to initialize the starting gradient when training).\r\n\r\nEither I am missunderstanding this, or it's hard to find the derivatives for well known cost functions (it has been a while since i have done this myself, and Math notation is a bit blurry to me).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
