Using the chain rule, this becomes:\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta w_1} = \\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta y_{pred}} \\times \\frac{\\delta y_{pred}}{\\delta w_1} $$\r\n\r\n$\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta y_{pred}}$ is the loss function, which is $(y_{true} - y_{pred})^2$. The derivative of the loss function is the line of code you highlighted: $-2 \\times (y_{true} - y_{pred})$.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is how this derivative is -2 instead of 2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vzhou842/neural-network-from-scratch/issues/comments/1333394704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davetang","id":2980289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODAyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2980289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang","html_url":"https://github.com/davetang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davetang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
