Is there training data that could address this? \r\nOr would that require some re-coding? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick","closed_by":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
