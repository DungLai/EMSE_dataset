I did it successfully, now i want to find the confidence score / probability of model. Like how much my model is confidence (86% confident of address result generated)\r\nFor which I tried using tf.nn.softmax but it's throwing an error.\r\nValue error:- \"Truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any or a.all\".\r\n\r\nIs there any way if you guys can help me out to find out confidence score, probability function which helps me out to use addressnet over millions of addresses.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards\r\nAj.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
