For example : UNIT 900, L 9, 50 THINGO ST, HOOHAAVILLE, VIC 3000. I even tried adding L to lookups.py and deleting the cache but to no avail. The kind of result I get is :\r\n    \"flat_number\": \"9009\",\r\n    \"flat_number_prefix\": \"L\",\r\n    \"flat_type\": \"UNIT\",\r\n    \"locality_name\": \"HOOHAAVILLE\",\r\n    \"number_first\": \"50\",\r\n    \"original\": \"UNIT 900, L 9, 50 THINGO ST, HOOHAAVILLE, VIC 3000\",\r\n    \"postcode\": \"3000\",\r\n    \"state\": \"VICTORIA\",\r\n    \"street_name\": \"THINGO\",\r\n    \"street_type\": \"STREET\"\r\n\r\nor L9 with no space drags the 9 into the 50.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get L in and recognised?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
