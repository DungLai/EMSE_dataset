I understand the TF version needs to be higher than 1.12 and I'm using 2.2 but there seems to have been changes to the TF syntax. \r\n\r\nE.g. `get_variable` is now `Variable`, `random_normal` is now `random.normal` in the `model.py` file. \r\n\r\nI tried to fix these and it worked but now I'm getting an error in a tensorflow file `tensorflow\\python\\ops\\variables.py` Line 261: `TypeError: _variable_v2_call() got an unexpected keyword argument 'initializer'`.\r\n\r\nCan you let me know please which specific Tensorflow version you used during the development?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
