Thanks for posting it.\r\nIt worked pretty well, though slow. Up to 7 seconds each on my micro cloud shell. \r\nMaybe this was due to the warning message.\r\n```\r\nWARNING:tensorflow:Estimator's model_fn (<function model_fn at 0x7eff508251e0>) includes params argument, but params are not passed to Estimator.\r\nrow 4 decomposing Address:  146/2 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL\r\npredicting for 146/2 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese addresses were scraped from an old council document so don't follow modern standards. There is no postcode.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/-/media/files/the-area/heritage/city-of-yarra-heritage-review-appendix-8.pdf?la=en&hash=5818FC0071A12F3C6C8FB489BA0582681264F0AD\r\n\r\nHere is a subset of the results. \r\n```\r\nNormalAddress,number_last_suffix,state,postcode,number_first,street_type,number_last,locality_name,building_name,street_name,flat_number\r\n142 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,142,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,\r\n144 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,144,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,\r\n146 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,146,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,\r\n146/1 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,,STREET,1,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,146\r\n146/2 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,,STREET,2,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,146\r\n146/7 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,,STREET,7,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,146\r\n146/8 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,48,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,16\r\n146/0 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,40,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,16\r\n160 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,160,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,\r\n162 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,162,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,\r\n```\r\nNotice that most addressed were decomposed correctly, but 146/8 and 146/0 were converted incorrectly. Interesting that the RNN generated new numbers 16 and 48 which are not in the input data. Its repeatable. Adding a postcode does not change the behaviour.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, this is not the standard way to write a unit address. Note that 8/146 converts fine.\r\n```\r\n8/146 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,146,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,8\r\n0/146 NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,146,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,0\r\n\r\n```\r\nAlso, when the number has a suffix, it sometimes gets added to the first_number\r\n176B NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,B,,,,\r\n176C NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,C,,,,\r\n176D NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,D,,,,\r\n176E NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,E,,,,\r\n176G NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,G,,,,\r\n176G NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,G,,,,\r\n176H NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,H,,,,\r\n176I NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176I,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,,,,,\r\n176J NOONE STREET CLIFTON HILL,,,,176J,STREET,,CLIFTON HILL,,NOONE,,,,,,\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some issues when the address is \r\n88 THE ESPLANADE CLIFTON HILL,,,,88,,,CLIFTON HILL,,THE ESPLANADE,,,\r\nIt does not detect THE ESPLANADE as a road_name, road_type.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
