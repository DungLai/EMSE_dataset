sorry for not being so active here.\r\nCalculating the probability of a given address is kind of difficult.\r\nRemember that this model (assuming you're using the same architecture as I originally implemented) performs the following:\r\n1. For each character it assigns a class probability of belonging to each address component\r\n2. Goes through each character one-by-one, grouping them into substrings belonging to each class\r\n3. Outputs a dictionary giving the final output4. \r\n\r\nSo actually we have a confidence per character of the input, and not of the output as a whole.\r\n\r\nYou could come up with some quality metric by taking the product of the highest class probability for each character. This would tell you the probability of all characters together being the correct class (probability multiplication rule). But the result might look a little misleading, because the product of probabilities will get smaller and smaller with the increasing length of the string. It's not nice to have a number that shrinks proportionally to the length of the address.\r\n\r\nYou could also take the average confidence of the predicted class for each letter. This would tell you that, on average, each letter was predicted with a confidence of _x_. It will not diminish with the string length, so might be more comparable between predictions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/1259337059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/1259521846","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/22#issuecomment-1259521846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/22","id":1259521846,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCZA00M5LEsc2","user":{"login":"Aj-232425","id":108046238,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnCnng","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108046238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425","html_url":"https://github.com/Aj-232425","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T13:36:50Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T13:36:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much @jasonrig for actively replying.\r\nYes, i did understood what you are telling.

And yeah, you are right . What i am getting is probability of each character. Doesn't look like confidence score. Initially i was getting array of character falling in class component, found out value have maximum value from array matrix.\r\nFor example we have word \"street\" probability looks like \"0.11,0.11,0.11,0.11\" , as you said we can't consider this as confidence as it's probability of character. Neither we can go with average or product .\r\n\r\nOf course, i have already tested on some real word actual data and using which I tried finding out accuracy. Where accuracy=precision=recall.\r\n\r\nMy aim is just to confirm, for ex, out of 1000 sample real world addresses, X% have high accuracy/confidence score/probability above some threshold of being true predicted. So that I don't need to check every sample address if it's predicted correctly or not.\r\nIf there's any suggestion, appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/1260007389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Aj-232425","id":108046238,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnCnng","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108046238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425","html_url":"https://github.com/Aj-232425","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aj-232425/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7471930024,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCZA00M5Ss8VOzwAAAAG9XJqo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/7471930024","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-27T20:23:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7471930039,"node_id":"SE_lADOCZA00M5Ss8VOzwAAAAG9XJq3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/7471930039","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-27T20:23:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
