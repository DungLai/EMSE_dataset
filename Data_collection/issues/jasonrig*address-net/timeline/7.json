But my code makes use of the tensorflow Estimator API to make things easy.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the [tensorflow docs on the Estimator API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/custom_estimators#write_a_model_function), you'll see that you can set up an Estimator object quite just using the model_fn along with optional parameters, [which I do here in the code](https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/blob/master/addressnet/predict.py#L111).\r\n\r\nOnce you have an Estimator object, you can use it for inference or training as you need. For this to work, you need an input_fn, which feeds data into the Estimator using the [Dataset API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets). For this, I have provided two input_fns in my code. [The first one](https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/blob/master/addressnet/dataset.py#L451) is for training, and it applies all the random transformations to the original GNAF data (this is where you can get creative). [The second one](https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/blob/master/addressnet/dataset.py#L486) is for inference, and feeds in user-supplied free-text data directly for prediction.\r\n\r\nIf you use the training input_fn provided, you will need a tfrecord file. This is a native tensorflow binary formatted file containing the original GNAF data. The code to produce the tfrecord file from the GNAF data is [here](https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/blob/master/generate_tf_records.py). I have chosen not to redistribute the tfrecord file because I'm unsure of whether there are any licensing issues. To get the input CSV file for this script, you'll need to set up a SQL server (e.g. Postgres) and import the SQL files as per the GNAF instructions so that you can export the \"address_view\" SQL view to a CSV file. All of these files are freely available and more info on that can be found on the [data.gov.au page](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf/resource/4b084096-65e4-4c8e-abbe-5e54ff85f42f).\r\n\r\nWhen you have set everything up, training should be as simple as running the [train method](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator#train) of the Estimator object. If you want to get fancy with multi-GPU or cloud-based training, you should take a look at [these docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distribute_strategy#using_tfdistributestrategy_with_estimator).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/526081438/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2593111141,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU5MzExMTE0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/2593111141","actor":{"login":"SinhUIT","id":14868220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY4MjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14868220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT","html_url":"https://github.com/SinhUIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-29T08:24:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2593111143,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1OTMxMTExNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/2593111143","actor":{"login":"SinhUIT","id":14868220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY4MjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14868220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT","html_url":"https://github.com/SinhUIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinhUIT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-29T08:24:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/526082513","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/7#issuecomment-526082513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/7","id":526082513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjA4MjUxMw==","user":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T08:27:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T08:27:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@poorlymac

There will always be some inputs that are not correctly parsed simply because this is a probabilistic model and doesn't follow any pre-defined rules. You could add incorrectly parsed examples to the training data and the model may improve to a degree. Indeed, the more true examples given in the training data (as opposed to the data from GNAF and the artificially corrupted examples used to help the model generalise), the better. But this data is difficult to find (and surely expensive to generate).\r\n\r\n2. The model produces per-character classes (each letter is assigned one of the address components) and each letter, through a post-processing step, is grouped by class to give the final output. Because the original spelling is preserved, it means that an error in input may be correctly split by address component but still might not be a valid address.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to consider how to perform some fuzzy matching against the GNAF dataset based on the result of the pre-trained model. Exactly how to do this, I don't know. There are many different approaches to string similarity matching, and you are likely to encounter errors that exist beyond spelling (e.g. incorrect street types, addresses that are on the boundary of post code or suburbs, etc.)\r\n\r\nYou might handle the above differently depending on your application. Real-time data entry (web forms, etc.) might show a list of possible entries, and offline batch processing might flag some entries for manual checking if too ambiguous. If the purpose is to geocode, then you might ignore some address components at the expense of precision.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/636549622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3391093135,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM5MTA5MzEzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/3391093135","actor":{"login":"hblandford","id":14069848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY5ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14069848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford","html_url":"https://github.com/hblandford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-31T23:50:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3391093136,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzOTEwOTMxMzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/3391093136","actor":{"login":"hblandford","id":14069848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY5ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14069848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford","html_url":"https://github.com/hblandford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hblandford/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-31T23:50:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/647068009","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/7#issuecomment-647068009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/7","id":647068009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzA2ODAwOQ==","user":{"login":"senthangamani","id":30724956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzI0OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30724956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani","html_url":"https://github.com/senthangamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthangamani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T02:03:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T02:03:08Z","author_association":"NONE","b
