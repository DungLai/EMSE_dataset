The TF version range in setup.py is bad!\r\nAt the time of development, it would have been 1.12 because I always set the version to be a minimum of the version I was using at the time of development. In this case, I forgot to set the upper limit to be less than version 2.0. There are definitely many breaking changes from TF 1.x to 2.x!\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to use any version up until 2.0 (v1.15 should be fine).\r\n\r\nBy the way, it should be possible to \"transplant\" the model weights into a TF 2.x project, but it would require a bit of work. So, if you want to use this project as-is (pre-trained models and all), I would suggest sticking to TF 1.x for the fastest result. If you want to build on this work, it could be that spending the time to port to TF 2.x is worthwhile.\r\n\r\nAs for your specific errors, I'd have to look into it more deeply (and I can't say when I will have time to do that). TF 2.x does have a compatibility API (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1) that you might be able to use to bridge the gap between TF 1.x and 2.x.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/641312684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/643599844","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/11#issuecomment-643599844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/11","id":643599844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzU5OTg0NA==","user":{"login":"myndworks","id":4483649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM2NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4483649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks","html_url":"https://github.com/myndworks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myndworks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-13T09:50:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-13T09:50:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also found the same issues as @ingram-arginlerit.
