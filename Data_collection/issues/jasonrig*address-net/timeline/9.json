You can see from my answer in issue #10 that the model produces one class per character. Since you are using unicode characters for the Vietnamese language, there are many more possible characters than the standard English alphabet (e.g. ă, â, đ, ê, ô, ơ). So, you have a choice:\r\n1. expand the number of possible characters (\"vocabulary\") to be bigger\r\n2. find a method to reduce the characters with accent marks back to their base character, e.g. ă, â -> a\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided how you will approach the problem, you need to find a structured database of addresses. You can use this to automatically generate labelled training data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/589490315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3059193633,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwNTkxOTM2MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/3059193633","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-21T04:17:27Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/599094738","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/9#issuecomment-599094738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/9","id":599094738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTA5NDczOA==","user":{"login":"1653100","id":46442068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyMDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100","html_url":"https://github.com/1653100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1653100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T16:42:44Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T16:42:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much.
