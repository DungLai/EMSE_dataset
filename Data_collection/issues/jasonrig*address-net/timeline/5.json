I'm guessing that the origin of this error is just that there aren't so many \"Lot\" property types with four-digit numbers.\r\n\r\nIf I'm right about the cause, the so the solution is simple insofar as it would require retraining with a better dataset. This shouldn't be so difficult since the pretrained model would be a reasonable set of starting parameters.\r\n\r\nThe approach I would take is to synthesise more addresses with larger street/lot/unit numbers during training. That said, the shortcoming of this code is that there is no real way to measure real-world performance since nobody, to my knowledge, has an annotated set of human-entered addresses. This means it would be difficult to assess whether the performance overall is increasing after such a change, or whether it improves these uncommon cases at the expense of performance on the more common address number ranges.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to leave this issue open, but I'm unsure when/whether I'll get around to this. If you do make any useful changes to the code, you're more than welcome to send through a PR!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/524133801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonrig","id":6635497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU0OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6635497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2578244499,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU3ODI0NDQ5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/2578244499","actor":{"login":"poorlymac","id":16620846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjIwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16620846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac","html_url":"https://github.com/poorlymac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-23T01:08:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2578244501,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NzgyNDQ1MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/events/2578244501","actor":{"login":"poorlymac","id":16620846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjIwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16620846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac","html_url":"https://github.com/poorlymac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-23T01:08:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/comments/524134992","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrig/address-net/issues/5#issuecomment-524134992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonrig/address-net/issues/5","id":524134992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDEzNDk5Mg==","user":{"login":"poorlymac","id":16620846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjIwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16620846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac","html_url":"https://github.com/poorlymac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorlymac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T01:15:05Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T01:15:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
