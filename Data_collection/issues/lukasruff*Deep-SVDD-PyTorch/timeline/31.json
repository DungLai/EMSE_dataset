The argument `affine` only relates to these affine learnable parameters, not to mean and standard deviation of the normalization, which are still learned.\r\n\r\nFor Deep SVDD, it is crucial to disable these affine transformations, as stated in section 3.3 of the paper:\r\n\r\n> Put differently, Proposition 2 implies that networks with bias terms can easily learn any constant function, which is independent of the input x âˆˆ X . It follows that bias terms should not be used in neural networks with Deep SVDD since the network can learn the constant function mapping directly to the hypersphere center, leading to hypersphere collapse.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, if your network contains a bias term, the last layer could just learn to set all weights to zero and the bias to the center `c`, mapping everything to the center without even taking the input data into account.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch/issues/comments/1213012724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
