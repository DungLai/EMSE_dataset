I have a few queries -\r\n\r\n1) My data consists of a training directory with labelled images (train --> class1, class2,.. --> images) and a testing directory of unlabelled images (test --> images). I have not been able to find a decent method to load them onto the code. Do I use a csv file to load them or is it to be done directly?\r\n2) How exactly would I have to configure/edit my data module to be the equivalent of mnist.py or cifar10.py (datasets directory)?\r\n3) As of now,  have edited the datasets and networks (I built a custom architecture) directories. Am I right in assuming that the modules in base, utils and optim need not be edited in any way. If not, how should I go about doing it?\r\n\r\nAny suggestion would be appreciated! Thank you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch/issues/comments/508556585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavanvyn","id":16152500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTUyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16152500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn","html_url":"https://github.com/pavanvyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2461201465,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyNDYxMjAxNDY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch/issues/events/2461201465","actor":{"login":"pavanvyn","id":16152500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTUyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16152500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn","html_url":"https://github.com/pavanvyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-04T18:49:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2461210084,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjQ2MTIxMDA4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch/issues/events/2461210084","actor":{"login":"pavanvyn","id":16152500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTUyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16152500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn","html_url":"https://github.com/pavanvyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavanvyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-04T18:58:05Z","rename":{"from":"custom

I have a few queries -\r\n> \r\n>     1. My data consists of a training directory with labelled images (train --> class1, class2,.. --> images) and a testing directory of unlabelled images (test --> images). I have not been able to find a decent method to load them onto the code. Do I use a csv file to load them or is it to be done directly?\r\n> \r\n>     2. How exactly would I have to configure/edit my data module to be the equivalent of mnist.py or cifar10.py (datasets directory)?\r\n> \r\n>     3. As of now,  have edited the datasets and networks (I built a custom architecture) directories. Am I right in assuming that the modules in base, utils and optim need not be edited in any way. If not, how should I go about doing it?\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thank you.\r\n\r\nHello, can you give me some instructions on how to use my own data?
