Please describe.**\r\nSometimes users are not sure if the article is relevant or not and they want to think about it a little bit more or discuss it with a colleague. In other situations an article can be very relevant and then they want ASReview to show more articles like that, and be able to find the article again easily.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn option to mark an article as uncertain and be able to make the decision later. The super relevant option could be an option during the screening proces when users think the article is more relevant than the other articles marked as relevant.\r\n\r\n**Why would you like to see this feature**\r\nCurrently there are only two options relevant and irrelevant. But in reality there are more levels of how relevant an article is, an article can be very relevant and the user could be uncertain about if the article is relevant or not.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
