Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn my review I apply inclusion and exclusion criteria. When the reviewing process is done, I want to be able to report to co-authors, reviewers and other researchers which criterion was applied to which paper. It is currently not possible to keep track of applied inclusion and exclusion criteria in ASReview.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTo solve this problem, I suggest adding a text field in the review screen, where researchers can place a comment explaining the decision they made. Perhaps they may just fill in something like 'I1', to signal that the first inclusion criterion was applied. Alternatively, they could describe the inclusion/exclusion criterion that was applied.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatively, researchers could be asked to indicate their inclusion/exclusion criteria before starting the ASReview process. These would then show up as radio buttons in the review screen. A downside to this is that it complicates the review screen. Additionally, inclusion/exclusion criteria may change during the ASReview process (e.g. researchers may think of a new inclusion/exclusion criterion they want to apply).\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nUsers fill the free text field with the inclusion/exclusion criterion applied to the paper.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
