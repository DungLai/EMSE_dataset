Feature Request\r\nGood day,\r\nFirst, thank you for providing ASReview open-source to the academic community, this is an incredible development sure to help many!\r\n\r\nOne problem I have encountered was that once I have selected a small range of relevant and irrelevant articles, that the subsequent review process was (understandably) heavily weighted on the initial articles. For example, I'm looking through several mental health studies and after marking perhaps too many articles focused on depression as relevant, I now seem to only get depression articles to screen. \r\n\r\nIf it was possible, it would be very helpful to allow for manual control in the screening process to allow the search feature or random study review again so that meaningfully different studies can be selected. The alternative I have is to save my current results (and selections) and restart the screening procedure to manually search for a mix of the articles I previously marked relevant as well as studies that can seed greater variety.
