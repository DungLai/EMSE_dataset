Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI started reviewing, and after 5 irrelevant items, I am given a choice, whether to stop or continue. I select to continue, and select two more irrelevant items. At this time, I wish to stop reviewing further records, and start the training/learning process. However, there is no such option at this phase. I have to keep on labelling the items, until I get the choice again. Sometimes this choice appears after I have marked 10 irrelevant items, and sometimes only after 15 irrelevant items.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be useful if there is an option to stop reviewing and execute the training, at any point after the first 5 irrelevant items (which is the 'base' requirement for a good training).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother option could be to have an option or a parameter at the dashboard, where the user specifies the number of irrelevant items required. Once this number is achieved, the training may start (or the option to start training is enabled). \r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
