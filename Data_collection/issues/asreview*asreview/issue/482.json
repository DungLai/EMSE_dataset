Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nIt can be very useful to know which terms from your systematic review search query/strategy are mentioned in the title and abstract of the articles you are reviewing. Often, I need to read the entire abstract to find out which of the terms are mentioned in the text and whether they are mentioned in the correct context.\r\n\r\nBeing able to see the words that you used in your search query (or other custom words) at a glance speeds up the review process significantly. I tested it with an alternative solution and it works great.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nA possibility to input your custom terms that will be highlighted in the title and abstract.\r\nMake this input field available through an extra button with a [highlighter icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/highlighter?style=solid) next to the export and settings buttons.\r\nAdd an on-off switch to show or hide the highlights.\r\n\r\n**Alternative solution**\r\nI currently use the Chrome extension [Multi-highlight](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-highlight/pfgfgjlejbbpfmcfjhdmikihihddeeji?hl=en) to highlight specific terms on the webpage in random colours.\r\nOne disadvantage is that it is also activated on all the other browser windows.\r\nExample of use:\r\n![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54170403/105996759-0be28200-60ab-11eb-95db-ac1ecfdabfb7.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nEasy to teach, just enter the custom terms that you want to highlight.\r\nThis feature is only added to the UI and does not cause any structural changes to the data or methods.\r\n\r\nOptionally include the option for adding regular expressions, but that is maybe a bit too much.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThank you for the excellent tool,\r\nTom\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
