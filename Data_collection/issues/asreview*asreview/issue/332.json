the bug**\r\nI've exported a large dataset (13,000 records) from EndNote as a RIS file. \r\nThis leads to a file with a `.txt` extension. \r\n\r\nUploading this file into asreview to an error message in the GUI (screenshot 1).\r\nLooking at the CLI output, at first it seemed there was one problematic record (screenshot 2).\r\nHowever, after deleting this record from the file with a text editor, I get an encoding error (screenshot 3). \r\nWhen I upload a part of of the references, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not (screenshot 4)\r\n\r\nI think there might be another corrupt entry in the .txt file, but the error message I'm getting is not informative. \r\nDo you know of a solution, for example, are there any tools how to inspect a RIS files for corrupt entries? \r\nOr could it be another problem? \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Export EndNote references as RIS export. \r\n2. Upload the resulting .txt file in ASReview (screenshot 1)\r\n3. Thanks to an informative error message in the CLI, I can remove the corrupt reference in a text editor.\r\n4. Upload again. (result = screenshot 2)\r\n5. Resave the .txt file as a .ris file in a text editor.\r\n6. Upload again (result = screenshot 3)\r\n7. Create new document with a subset from the original text file output from endnote.\r\n8. Upload again (result = screenshot 4) \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n1. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/92101511-84376680-eddd-11ea-8285-7bbf713a1c40.png)\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/92101523-8994b100-eddd-11ea-8f62-2859a173f209.png)\r\n\r\n3.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/92101997-3a9b4b80-edde-11ea-9e78-f51a663941b7.png)\r\n\r\n4. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/92102371-d036db00-edde-11ea-9de4-46660c909395.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - ASReview version 11.1\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
