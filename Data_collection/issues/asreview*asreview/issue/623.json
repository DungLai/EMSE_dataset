Please describe.**\r\nA simulation run can often take many hours. It would be nice for the people using ASReview simulation to know how many papers are left to be screened.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTwo TQDM-like progress bars that show:\r\n\r\n- How many papers have been screened over the total number of papers in the dataset.\r\n- How many relevant papers have been found over the total number of relevant papers in the dataset.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have not really considered other alternatives. There could also be an output message in the simulation every time a paper is screened, and the number of papers left to be screened (same with the relevant papers: message every time a relevant paper is found, and the number of relevant papers yet to be found), but I don't like it as much.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nI would add a parameter, `progress-bar`, that is false by default and true if the user wants to see the progress of the simulation.\r\n\r\nMaybe with screenshot or design?\r\n\r\n![prog_ast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57364973/120694487-90566e80-c4aa-11eb-909e-bc3ff2628f01.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
