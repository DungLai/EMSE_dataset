Perhaps it is possible to adress this while choosing the type of exportfile. E.g. you can choose to export a file with notes, but you get a reminder that this file is not suitable for import and that if you want a file suitable for import, you should choose option x.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot develop it myself, but I would be happy to contribute to the development from a users end. \r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?
