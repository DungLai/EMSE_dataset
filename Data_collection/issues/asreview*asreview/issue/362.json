Please describe.**\r\nIn dark mode the contrast is sometimes hard to read, especially when starting a project the text is brown with a black background, the doi is also brown with a black background\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice if the contrast would get better. So no brown text with a black/grey background in dark mode. The overal contrast is also low, some users in the usability tests thought this could be higher.\r\n\r\n**Why would you like to have this feature**\r\nEspecially in dark mode brown text with a grey/black is hard to read. The overall contrast is fine, but also low.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
