it takes 4 steps to create a new project. It's a bit tedious at first. The steps can be curtailed.\r\n\r\nAn initial solution is importing an unlabeled dataset and later selecting prior knowledge. The project information can be pre-filled, and the model can use the default settings. Before warming up the AI, a checklist of project information, data, and model is presented to users.\r\n\r\nIf users import a partly labeled dataset, the labeled records can be automatically recognized as prior knowledge so that a new Oracle project can be created with just one operation, i.e., importing the dataset.\r\n\r\nUsers may be allowed to edit the pre-filled project information and the default model settings.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1183/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
