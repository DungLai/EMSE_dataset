Please describe.**\r\nI have started to use ASReview to discover interesting research papers / knowledge about various topics. The problem is that the small, fixed set of data collections it comes with isn't likely to contain what I am looking for\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like there to be a plug-in which allows me to use the CORE API (https://core.ac.uk/services/api/) to create an initial set of papers to review. The API is limited to 10 pages of 100 articles each, so it's important to help the user formulate a query that returns a specific set of results. Also, some filtering of duplicates may be required.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've built a small script to query the CORE API /article/search and create a .csv file with title, abstract and URL. This works, however the iteration cycle is rather long and cumbersome - it would be nicer to have it integrated as 1 experience\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nI think most users will naturally understand how to leverage this new source of potential knowledge. I recently discovered CORE after having obtained ASReview and I have no affiliation or know any of their team members, but I suspect they may be interested to collaborate: https://core.ac.uk/about/#team. Both projects seem very much aligned in their philosophy\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
