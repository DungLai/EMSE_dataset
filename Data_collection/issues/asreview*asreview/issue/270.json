Upon screening, I expect the relevant publications to be shown in red, and the irrelevant publications in black. However, all publications are displayed in black text, regardless their relevancy. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nFollow the steps from the [end-user testing guide](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_testing_algorithms.html). In other words: create a project with one of the example datasets, and start screening. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nFor example, this publication is relevant, but the text colour is black. \r\n<img width=\"1402\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/84177438-2962cd00-aa83-11ea-8e0f-b055badd419f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n - OS: macOS (15)\r\n - ASReview version 0.9.5\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
