I am interested in the ranking measures of the unlabeled articles in the pool. In particular the change in ranking as a result of adding prior knowledge being me telling the model this article is relevant. In the labeling process the model reaches a point that the ranking of the unlabeled articles does not change anymore. Or to put in more general terms, the change in ranking minimalizes. As a user the model reaches a point that I am OK with the ranking. At the moment I do not know when that point is reached. A measure of change in ranking would be helpful. Eg the proportion of rankings of the remaining unlabeled articles that did change. A visualization of the proportion would be awesome. As a user I can decide whether it is time to stop labeling.\r\n\r\nNow, at that particular user defined point in the process, me and the model do not know how many of the remaining articles will de  be deemed relevant. What we do know is that there will a point that there will be only irrelevant articles left. Assuming ASReview presents the highest ranked articles first (which could be different in the early training part of the model). The unknown point that relevant switches to irrelevant is of interest. It is not the task of ASReview to predict that point. However insight in the change between the prior and posterior rankings eg the proportion of unlabeled articles of which the relative standing has changed would be helpful. A plot of that proportion over 'time' would be nice on the analytics page. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDiederick\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
