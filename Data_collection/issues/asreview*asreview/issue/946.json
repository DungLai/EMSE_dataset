Due to company policies, this is often prohibited, as it also requires installing python. Clearly, I could install it on a VM within our organisation, but this would mean that all users can see other users' projects, and that is not what I want. So I would rather like to install ASreview on a VM, and query it using a REST API, so my own GUI can create ASreview projects for each user on their own page, without interfering with other people's projects. It requires also an easy way to filter projects, so I don't need to request all projects.\r\n\r\nTypically, I would like to:\r\n\r\n- POST: Create a project: specify (project or user) name and area of interest / title.\r\n- GET: Query projects by name or title: this may zero one or more hits and returns the project ID and all metadata.\r\n- GET: Query projects by ID, returning all metadata including the relevant articles.\r\n- GET + PUT: Search relevant articles for each project using a query to initialize it. Preferably more than 10 results should be returned.\r\n- GET + PUT: Get random articles for each project to initialize it (PUT is needed to indicate relevant or irrelevant - see next point).\r\n- GET + PUT: Get the next article as suggested by ASreview and indicate whether it is relevant or irrelevant (PUT projectID, articleID, true/false).\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
