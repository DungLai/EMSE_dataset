the bug**\r\nWhen making use of the simulation mode and the prior_idx only has irrelevant papers, the model uses more - random - prior information untill a relevant paper is found instead of only the priors given with prior_idx. It makes sense that the model needs relevant papers, but this makes that the model is different than what you think you simulated (if you do not look at the state file). A solution might be to add a warning that you did not include a relevant paper as prior.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n- Run a simulation with only irrelevant papers as priors;\r\n- Look in the state file at the training data used for the first itteration and the labels for result 0;\r\n- Repeat the process with a simulation that includes a relevant paper to see the difference.\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - ASReview version .14\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
