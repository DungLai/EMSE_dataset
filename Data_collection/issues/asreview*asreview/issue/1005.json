The authors expect that victims of female offenders are less likely to report to the police than victims of male offenders because of differences in the victim-offender relationship as well as in the victim's sex. With recent developments in Bayesian statistics, new tools have become available that enable the direct evaluation of researchers' expectations. All cases of robbery with assault from the National Crime Victimization Survey have been investigated (n = 478). Findings reveal that female offenders are underreported compared with male offenders and that this can be explained by the victim characteristics but only in combination with the offender's sex. © The Author(s) 2012.\r\nER  - \r\nTY  - JOUR\r\nT1  - Meaning-in-life orientations and values in youth: Cross-cultural comparison\r\nA1  - Gorlova, Natalia\r\nA1  - Romanyuk, Lyudmyla\r\nA1  - Vanbrabant, Leonard\r\nA1  - van de Schoot, Rens\r\nY1  - 2012/11//\r\nKW  - Meaning of life\r\nKW  - Measurement invariance\r\nKW  - Purpose in life\r\nKW  - The Meaning-in-Life Orientations test\r\nJF  - European Journal of Developmental Psychology\r\nVL  - 9\r\nIS  - 6\r\nSP  - 744\r\nEP  - 750\r\nDO  - 10.1080/17405629.2012.689823\r\nN2  - Search for purposes in life and the meaning of life is one of the developmental tasks in youth. The Meaning-in-Life Orientations test (MOL) is often used to assess purposes in life and meaningfulness of life and is often used to compare individuals and groups. It is yet unclear whether this test shows measurement invariance across different countries or not, which was the main object of the current study. First, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted separately for data sets with Russian and Ukrainian students. Second, metric and scalar invariance were tested. Finally, comparisons between Russian and Ukrainian students were made on their scores on the MOL. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\r\nER  - \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12981139/157640876-7bd28d35-3b14-4eaa-9bd1-334ac8c54f3f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quickfix / temp fix\r\n\r\n1.
