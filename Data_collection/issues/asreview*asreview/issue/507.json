I also waited to see if it just needed time (this was not the case). I also closed ASreview and restarted the computer, did not work either. Another explanation might be that I used the review history button and I changed some classifications because of a reliability analysis I conducted with a colleage (I included articles I first excluded and the other way around). I do not think that is the reason though?\r\n\r\nI use Windows and ASreview 0.16.\r\n\r\n![Bild_2021-03-12_142900](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80527558/110946544-48a6c780-833f-11eb-9ef4-2e521b329372.png)\r\n\r\nHope you can help out!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rensvandeschoot","id":36502709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36502709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot","html_url":"https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
