Please describe.**\r\nThe current neural network implementation in ASReview is training a new model from scratch every time a new record is labeled (this affects both the lab and simulation modes). This seems unnecessary - the model architecture is the same every time, and the goal of the model is the same too. The only change between consecutive models is the input data.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe NN models in ASReview could be considered a transfer learning problem: the model weights of a previously trained model can be used to initialize the new model. The amount of epochs trained per model can then be reduced significantly. This could lead to an increase in performance (since the model weights will still be trained over more epochs eventually) and to a reduction in computing time required. Reducing computing time this way opens up options that might otherwise be too computationally expensive (like using a deeper network).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this would not be easy to implement within the current structure of ASReview, and it would also require additional research to figure out how optimally implement this (including hyperparameter settings like the amount of trained epochs) and how it affects performance. For these reasons it's not possible for me personally to implement this as part of my thesis.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nThis change does not affect how users interact with ASReview, though some documentation explaining how the neural network works could be useful.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
