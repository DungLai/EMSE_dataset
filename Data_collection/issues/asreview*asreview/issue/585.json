However, in my  case, I had two issue: couldn't use the search mode and, consequently, couldn't see the title in prior knowledge selection because my datafile contain collumns names started in uppercase letter. In this case, ASReview code couldn't recognize the title. \r\n   As a palliative solution, helped by ASReview people, I download the file I already started screening in .xlsx format, with relevant and irrelevant collumns add by ASReview, change the title collumns \"Title\" to \"title\" and \"Abstract\" to \"abstract\". After save this file, I upload again to ASReview and it so recognize the title and I could use the search mode, while my previous prior knowledge was preserved. \r\n\r\nIn other words, I did the following: \r\n\r\n> start screening without see the title and not able to use search mode\r\n> Use prior knowledge for about 80 articles \r\n> download the file provided by ASReview model \r\n> change the collumns name to 'title' and 'abstract' \r\n> upload again this file to ASReview \r\n> sees title and able to use search mode \r\n> my previous prior knowledge was preserved\r\n> keep moving forward \r\n\r\nIn this sense, I think it could be useful to change or add some code to recognize collumns that start with uppercase letter. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rensvandeschoot","id":36502709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36502709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot","html_url":"https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
