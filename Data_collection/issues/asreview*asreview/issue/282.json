(we work as well with 2 opinions per article ... which would be better, if supported)\r\n\r\nI know, this is a big change, but I wanted to start a discussion on this, to get your opinion.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
