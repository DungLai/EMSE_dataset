It would be nice if I have the option to choose multiple views. Sometimes it helps to see 3, 4, 6, 8 articles in a glance. By comparing eg 8 articles it is sometimes easier to say yes, no, no, yes, yes, no, no, yes. \r\n\r\nThere is room enough on my screen.\r\n\r\nNote\r\nCognitively having a multi article view might fit a different review approach also. My hypothesis would be that a reviewer with less subject matter expertise will find the review process more convenient in a multi view mode than a single view mode.  But this might be something for a bachelor or master thesis. In more general terms the level of subject matter expertise matters and has influence on the ranking stability. Less subject matter expertise is more random choosing. This could be moderated by the review strategy which can be manipulated by the order and the way the non-labeled articles are displayed. Anyways ... a multiple view would be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
