Is it possible to make this clickable with the link from “Open”\r\nSome users where clicking on the Title, expecting that the project would open.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to terminal and open ASR\r\n2. When the browser started, en alas loaded the page\r\n3. Go with you mouse to the project tile you already created\r\n4. The cursor will change to a hand (what indicates it is clickable)\r\n5. The user clicks, but has to go to the button \"Open\"\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThe title here has an \"ahref\"  but is not clickable. especially for mobile this would be very useful.\r\n<img width=\"466\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45943709/97968179-93776800-1dbe-11eb-8c0d-89811dac1966.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFrom an Usability Test we had some user who did this. It can be frustrating to click on something without a reaction. Do you have that as well?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
