Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature you would like to see?**\r\nAn option to have an overview in ASReview of what articles are relevant and irrelevant. And maybe an option to change the decision. Right now you can only see an overview of the decisions you already made and the articles when you download the results. If you just want to have a quick look this costs some time.\r\n\r\n**How can users use this?**\r\nUsers can use this to see which articles they already marked and if there are articles that are duplicates. Having the option to also change the decision in this overview will give users the opportunity to detect mistakes they made earlier\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/412/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
