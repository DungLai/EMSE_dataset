Please describe.**\r\nOften a dataset has a field with Digital Object Identifiers. ASReview will then display the DOI with hyperlink during screening.\r\n\r\n![](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/doi.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, not for all records a DOI is often available, but often a column `url` is also available. \r\n\r\n@bmkramer / @boer0107: is this a standard output of ris files?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would propose ASReview to detect if the `doi` field is missing and then checks the`url` colum and parse the hyperlink to the front-end if available.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWhen I changed the column name `url` into `doi`, the hyperlinks did show up in the front-end, but the hyperlinks did not work. I would like to know what ASReview does under the hood with the DOI so that we can add this information to the documentation. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36502709/110288252-02bccd00-7fe8-11eb-8af1-526e8a5124bf.png)","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
