ASReview team works on a new, browser interface for the software. The\r\ncurrent interface is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and is not very user-friendly. The new interface requires a completely new frontend and backend\r\nstructure. **The CLI will be removed.**\r\n\r\nThis issue serves as a roadmap for the development of the new user\r\ninterface. We will update this issue with new TODO items.\r\n\r\n## Algorithms\r\n\r\nWe did a lot of work on the API of ASReview. The base structure of the models\r\nwas changed to prepare the software for the new interface.\r\n\r\nSTATUS: Done\r\n\r\n## Backend\r\n\r\nThe command `asreview oracle YOUR_DATA` will launch a simple Python file\r\nserver to server HTML, CSS and javascript files. HTTP requests are handled\r\nwith a simple flask app.\r\n\r\n- [x] The HTTP protocol requires an async structure of the backend. Locking the log file is one of the challenges. \r\n- [x] Serve GET and POST http requests with flask. Abstracts, stats, start/stop,..\r\n- [ ] Serve static frontend files (JS, HTML, CSS)\r\n\r\n## Front-end\r\n\r\nThe front-end will be a single page javascript app written built on React.\r\nThis React app handles the entire reviewing process and interacts with the\r\nbackend after a decision. To simplify the process of styling the app, we make\r\nuse of Material UI and Material philosophy. \r\n\r\n- [x] Design, UX/UI brainstorm sessions \r\n- [x] Build a mock\r\n- [ ] Implement the functionality of the CLI interface in React\r\n- [ ] Add developer documentation on the design guidelines\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nThe browser user-interface requires a slightly different way of packaging our\r\napp. We make use of a single Python server and separate this from Node. Node\r\nis for development only. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement and test packaging workflow\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
