This package seems to be a great replacement for the libact package, which causes plenty of issues. I also replaces large parts of our code base. \r\n\r\nCheck https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL. Very modular package, plenty of query strategies, high code coverage, ...\r\n\r\nMain features we can use:\r\n- Pool based sampling https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/examples/pool-based_sampling.html\r\n- Interactive sampling https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/examples/interactive_labeling.html\r\n- Keras integration https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/examples/Keras_integration.html\r\n- Easy to extend https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/overview/Extending-modAL.html\r\n- Nice plots\r\n\r\n## Notes \r\n\r\n- Each query strategy has an argument `n_instances` (yes!!!)\r\n- Python 3.5+ only (Should we do as well imo) \r\n- The way we are validating our result depends on the unlabelled cases in our pool. We have to check how this works in relation to ModAL.\r\n- Have a look at \"Query by Committee\" https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/models/Committee.html (@daob)\r\n\r\n@daob @parisa-zahedi @Rensvandeschoot \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
