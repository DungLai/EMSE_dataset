Please describe.**\r\nDuplicate papers can be contained in the set of papers used for ASReview. This can be the result of using multiple sources, where not each source provides the exact same data (meaning it is more difficult to detect duplicates). Currently, the only options in ASReview are to include or exclude a paper. For a duplicate paper, you want to do neither.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA solution to this problem would be an option to mark a paper as duplicate. If there are other use cases for this option, you may want to call this option something generic such as 'ignore'. I would suggest to then completely retrain the model without the ignored paper and also exclude it from any future calculations. It should still be shown in the eventual output, since it was a decision made by the researcher that they would like to document.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIn terms of duplicate detection, a feature within ASReview could be considered, to help out researchers (like myself) who struggle to properly remove duplicates. I cannot necessarily think of any other alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nWhen a reviewer realizes that the paper he is currently looking at is a duplicate, he can choose the 'ignore' button. A pop-up explaining the consequences of their decision is displayed and the reviewer is asked to agree with the consequences. The model is retrained and the paper is ignored in further calculations.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
