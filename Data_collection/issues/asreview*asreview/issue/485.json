Please describe.**\r\nThe possibility to upload multiple datasets. Reference managers are well equipped to combine records from multiple sources into one dataset, but in some cases this is not sufficient:  When you want to upload a (partly) labeled records, or when you've already started screening in ASReview. Then, you will need some Excel or R/Python skills to add a 'label_included' column to your data. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be very convenient to the user to be able to upload multiple datasets at the `Select dataset` step. These are then combined by ASReview into one pool that needs to be screened. A column called 'dataset' or 'file' should be added to trace the record's original file.\r\n\r\nExtension 1: Let's say you have prepared a set of 20 'key papers'. If you can drag this set to the 'Drag file with prior inclusions' box, there is no need to type and search for these records in the `Select prior knowledge` step. This saves a lot of time. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/106442208-49fcee80-647b-11eb-949c-aaa3ea74b07c.png)\r\n\r\nPlease don't mind my design skills.\r\n\r\nExtension 2: the option to upload a new file with records while screening has already started. At the moment, if a user needs to add a couple of additional records to their project the only solution is to export the project, paste the additional records in de excel export, and start a new project where you upload this file. This process is also described here in the [FAQ](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/faq.html#related-question-how-can-i-add-more-publications-while-i-are-already-started-screening-in-asreview). It would be nice to have the option to just upload a file with some additional records in the project dashboard: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/106445395-41a6b280-647f-11eb-8963-17420e1e7661.png)\r\n\r\nDrawbacks: \r\nThe feature of adding additional records while screening has already started probably has major consequences for reproducibility and the state file (@PeterLombaers). Another point of attention of this feature is that there are probably a lot of possibilities to misuse it. For example, with uploading multiple datasets deduplication has probably not taken place while this is a very important step. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives are explained in the documentation, \r\n - https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/pre_screening.html#partly-labeled-data \r\n -  https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/faq.html#i-already-started-labeling-before-i-came-across-asreview-how-can-i-keep-my-former-screening-decisions-when-starting-a-new-project-in-asreview \r\n -  https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/faq.html#related-question-how-can-i-add-more-publications-while-i-are-already-started-screening-in-asreview\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nSee above.
