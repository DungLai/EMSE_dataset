issue proposes a new file structure for the labeled.json file in the project folder. An example of this file can be found here: https://github.com/asreview/asreview-project-files-testing/blob/master/v0.10.1/asreview-project-v0-10-1-startreview/labeled.json. \r\n\r\nThe current structure of the file is:\r\n```\r\n[[3702, 1], [3462, 0], [5103, 0], [1073, 0], [772, 0], [1175, 0]]\r\n```\r\nThis format is not very flexible and hard to extend because it is position based. This issue proposes to make this key-value based. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[{\"id\": 3702, \"label\": 1}, {\"id\": 3462, \"label\": 0}, {\"id\": 5103, \"label\": 0}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it straightforward to add new variables like datetime and user identifiers. I'm interested in extending the labeled file with datetime variables right away. \r\n\r\nThe technical state file is not affected. The technical state is also used for simulations and those variables aren't relevant in a simulation context.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change run_model entry point\r\n- [ ] Update middleware (REST/backend code)\r\n- [ ] Add date and time variables\r\n- [ ] Backwards compatibilty\r\n- [ ] Test test test\r\n\r\n@qubixes Can you have a look at this proposal?","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
