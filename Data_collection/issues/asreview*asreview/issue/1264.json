the bug**\r\nAs reported by @MartijnOW in https://github.com/asreview/asreview/discussions/1215#discussioncomment-4037442 it seems using different `seed` values for the `random query strategy` does not result in different rankings of the unseen papers. \r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem as reported by @MartijnOW:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:: Simulate runs\r\nmkdir output\\simulation\\HEA_Early_Detection_CVD_2016_2022_DE\\state_files\r\nasreview simulate data\\data.xlsx -s output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_0.asreview -q random --init_seed 1 --seed 1\r\nasreview metrics output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_0.asreview -o output\\simulation\\data\\metrics_sim_data_0.json\r\nasreview simulate data\\data.xlsx -s output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_1.asreview -q random --init_seed 2 --seed 2\r\nasreview metrics output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_1.asreview -o output\\simulation\\data\\metrics_sim_data_1.json\r\nasreview simulate data\\data.xlsx -s output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_2.asreview -q random --init_seed 3 --seed 3\r\nasreview metrics output\\simulation\\data\\state_files\\sim_data_2.asreview -o output\\simulation\\data\\metrics_sim_data_2.json\r\n\r\nThis seems to indeed lead to a ranking without any prior knowledge. However, the issue is that I cannot make the random ranking vary per simulation. When changing the init_seed the outcomes remain the same and the same goes for changing the model seed or doing both. Is there a way to get a different random ranking per simulation?\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
