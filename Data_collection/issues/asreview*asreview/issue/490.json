And what did you expect to happen?*\r\n\r\nI installed `asreview` on my _managed_ system using the macOS instructions. I did this on an existing DeepLearning anaconda virtual environment, because I don't want python 3.6+ to mix with the native python version. When I try to execute it or try to get the version I get the error. I expected `asreview` to open up a browser.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\nInitially I installed `asreview`, and did the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusername@macbook ~\r\n$ workon deeplearning\r\n(deeplearning)\r\nusername@ macbook ~\r\n$ asreview --version\r\nIllegal instruction: 4\r\n(deeplearning)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext I proceeded to uninstall `asreview` and re-install it again. Sometimes that fixes things, but unfortunately the error persisted.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install asreview\r\nCollecting asreview\r\n  Using cached asreview-0.16-py3-none-any.whl (2.4 MB)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: rispy in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (0.6.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: setuptools in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (51.1.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: openpyxl in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (3.0.6)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: pandas in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (1.2.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: dill in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (0.3.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: sklearn in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (0.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (1.19.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: h5py in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (2.10.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: flask>=1.1 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (1.1.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: flask-cors in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (3.0.10)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: xlrd>=1.0.0 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from asreview) (2.0.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: Jinja2>=2.10.1 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from flask>=1.1->asreview) (2.11.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: Werkzeug>=0.15 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from flask>=1.1->asreview) (1.0.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: click>=5.1 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from flask>=1.1->asreview) (7.1.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: itsdangerous>=0.24 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from flask>=1.1->asreview) (1.1.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=0.23 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from Jinja2>=2.10.1->flask>=1.1->asreview) (1.1.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: Six in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from flask-cors->asreview) (1.15.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: et-xmlfile in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from openpyxl->asreview) (1.0.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: jdcal in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from openpyxl->asreview) (1.4.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.3 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas->asreview) (2020.5)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7.3 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas->asreview) (2.8.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: scikit-learn in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from sklearn->asreview) (0.24.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl>=2.0.0 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn->sklearn->asreview) (2.1.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: scipy>=0.19.1 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn->sklearn->asreview) (1.5.4)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: joblib>=0.11 in ./.virtualenvs/deeplearning/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn->sklearn->asreview) (1.0.0)\r\nInstalling collected packages: asreview\r\nSuccessfully installed asreview-0.16\r\n(deeplearning)\r\nusername@macbook ~\r\n$ asreview --version\r\nIllegal instruction: 4\r\n(deeplearning)\r\nusername@ macbook ~\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nnone\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n -
