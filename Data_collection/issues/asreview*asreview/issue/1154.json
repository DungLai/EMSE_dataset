But if the title is exported as `T1`, as it is apparently implemented in Citavi, ASReview does not show any titles, neither in the search nor in the review. However, as far as I understand the RIS specification, both are allowed and correct. \r\n\r\nCouldn't this be added relatively easily in the RIS processing?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nFelix</div>\r\n\r\n@felixhorch thanks for reporting, what version of ASReview are you using? Thanks for the attempted debug. Will look into it.
