have a remark regarding the red \"new project\" button found on the ASReview lab page.\r\n\r\nI have found this button to be engaged by both hover and click. By clicking the button, it automatically triggers the hover input too, resulting in the menu opening and then immediatly closing from the click. \r\n\r\nI might be stubborn, but this has happened every time I use the button. The solution would be to have it be either clickable or hover, but not both.\r\n\r\n![temp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28191416/134874926-2c625639-3a43-49ce-9782-0b267b627b98.gif)\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"terrymyc","id":17449217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDQ5MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17449217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/756/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
