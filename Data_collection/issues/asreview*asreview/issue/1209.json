Please describe.**\r\nIn user experience research by Carolien Modinger it turned out that users find it hard to find and use the community for tips and feedback.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA solution would be to add a specific \"community\" button linking to a community section on the asreview website (https://asreview.nl/community, work in progress). This leads to increased visibility and accessibility of the community towards new and existing users.\r\n\r\nCarolien proposed 2 approaches:\r\n![community_button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65157657/189097820-0a17825d-7a40-47dd-94ff-0a42d6db06aa.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough approach 1 is presumably simpler to implement, approach 2 puts a stronger emphasis towards \"community\" and would therefore be preferred.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSee approach 1 & 2\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nSee above\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/1209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
