Please describe.**\r\nThis one is not exactly a 'feature' from the user point of view, but rather a new functionality from the scientific usage point of view. \r\nIs it possible to somehow categorize the documents in the dataset? Some kind of clustering, say for example, if I want to categorize the papers on AI applications, into \"cybersecurity\", \"health\", \"industrial\", \"manufacturing\" etc. (just giving very simple examples, to explain the idea), would it be possible? \r\nA simple text search may yield a lot of these results, but I am curious if it could be automatized using the ASReview tool. \r\nThis may help researchers extract some knowledge from the documents. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clustering technique, along with any Natural Language Processing technique.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
