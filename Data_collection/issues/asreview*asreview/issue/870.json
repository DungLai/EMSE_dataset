It seems batch size is not taken into account. If we have 10 documents we can see 10 HTTP Requests to api/.../init_ready. If we increase batch size we don't see any difference in performance and get the same number of HTTP requests.  Could you please let us know how to increase the performance with increasing batch_size ?
