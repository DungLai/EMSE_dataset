Please describe.**\r\nDuring the user experience tests some users have trouble with understanding the statistics and the graphs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA question mark icon which users can click on to see more information about the different graphs and statistics.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere could also be more text in the statistics and surrounding the graphs so it is not even necessary to click on the question mark icon. I also couldn't find any clear documentation about the interpretation of the statistics and the graphs\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nUsers that are new to ASReview can use it to get more information very easily about the statistics without it interrupting the screening process. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
