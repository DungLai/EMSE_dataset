Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the selection of training algorithm, i.e. Na√Øve Bayes, SVM etc. is allowed/presented only once, after the initial Oracle mode. But what if I want to reuse my labelled set and apply next algorithm to the same set, without going through the same cycle of marking records as 'relevant' or 'irrelevant'? This way, I can compare the results on same training set by different algorithms. \r\nAt present, this is possible, but by creating a new project, where I have to upload the previously labelled dataset as input. It would be easier if I could achieve multiple result files, by selecting different algorithms within the same project. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOn the dashboard screen, creating a new option/button called \"Retrain\".\r\n\r\n1. Retrain\r\n2. Select algorithm\r\n... (and following steps as the first training cycle).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs an alternative, the same could be done by importing a saved project, and applying another training on the input set. However, there's a problem with this, which is reported separately. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
