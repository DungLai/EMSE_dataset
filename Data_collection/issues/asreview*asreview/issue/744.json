Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, some repositories (e.g https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/new/choose) have issue templates while others do not (e.g https://github.com/asreview/asreview-wordcloud/issues/new). So there is not one clear way of reporting/handling issues.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd the same templates to all repositories if possible. Exceptions should be kept to a minimum to lower the overhead for managing those templates.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSomehow direct all issues to one repository while this might be confusing to the community and users.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nWe can then just open an issue in any repository and the process is unified. There is nothing extra that the user should do, really. It would just look the same across the organisation, also helping the community manage those repositories more uniformly.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
