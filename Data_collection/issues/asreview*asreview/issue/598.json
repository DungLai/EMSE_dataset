Please describe.**\r\nSimulation runs can take quite long for models with high computation times. The current default behavior is to stop the simulation when every single document has been labelled. However, after all relevant documents have been found, there is no reason to continue the simulation for most of the metrics currently used. A lot of computation time can be saved by stopping the simulation when all relevant documents are found.\r\n\r\n![first_long_simulation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42623130/117465718-42555600-af52-11eb-8602-1f9b490e9899.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a CLI option that allows stopping the simulation when all relevant documents are found. This could probably be a default setting, though I'm sure there are some cases where it is useful to finish the full simulation run.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative solution could be printing a message in the terminal when all relevant documents have been found. The user can then choose to stop the run by issuing a keyboard interrupt.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\nAdding it to the current documentation about the CLI should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
