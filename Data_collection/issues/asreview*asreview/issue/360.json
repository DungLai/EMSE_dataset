ASReview team,\r\n\r\nAfter using ASReview for a while I realized there were still many duplicate records in my dataset that weren't recognized by my reference management software. I didn't want to lose my progress so I downloaded the Excel spreadsheet of results, manually removed the duplicates, and uploaded it again (in a new project). I named the column that indicates which records I had previously labeled (ir)relevant 'included', as recommended in the FAQ.\r\n\r\nUploading the file works, and ASReview correctly recognizes the 'included' column, displaying the correct numbers under 'prior knowledge'. I set the active learning model to the default settings (Classifier:\r\nNa√Øve Bayes; Query strategy: Max; Feature extraction: tf-idf).\r\n\r\nClicking 'Finish' results in an endless loading icon on 'training model' and the following error message:\r\n\r\n_An error occured. Please send an email to asreview@uu.nl or file an issue on GitHub.\r\nError message\r\nindex 6323 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 6077_\r\n\r\n(I have tried it a couple of times and the 'index' number sometimes changes, but is always greater than 6077, which is the number of records in my dataset).\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to solve this, it would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nLaurien Meijer","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
