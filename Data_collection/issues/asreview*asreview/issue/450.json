Please describe.**\r\n\r\n- Not releated to an issues, but would help in the workflow \"updating an existing systematic review\" where there's a substantial set of relevant studies known that can be exported at once and that are not included in the newly found set of items to be screened.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- During the 'Select prior knowledge' it should be possible to upload a set of relevant articles, using the same steps as uploading the data via 'From file'. It should add all these items to the project marked as 'relevant'.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- The alternative is to combine the set of already known relevant items with the new set that needs to be screened. and then manually lookup the articles in the total set.\r\n\r\n**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**\r\n\r\n- Import option added during the select prior knowledge phase. All items in the file that will be imported must be: a. relevant to the current project. And b. not already included in the dataset that was uploaded/selected during set up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49488769/103537086-01f6a600-4e94-11eb-88da-7919bf38a3cb.png)\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"J535D165","id":12981139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxMTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165","html_url":"https://github.com/J535D165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J535D165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/450/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
