The first training never ends. I think it has something to do with the fact that the file is almost 2GB, with >1M papers.\r\n\r\n*What happened? And what did you expect to happen?*\r\n\r\nWhen I click FINISH in the FINISH SETUP screen, it stalls:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90268625/133986913-a159331d-fb86-4c90-aa7f-2c354ac10cbb.png)\r\n\r\nStays like this forever:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90268625/133986738-6c2b9a6b-03bd-418a-9d80-a848f875e4b5.png)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Upload a large file\r\n2. Run the first training\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\n - OS: Debian\r\n - ASReview version 0.17.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe process of using such a large file has been problematic. To upload it, I had to send the file directly to the server and then run a small python line to add the project with the dataset manually:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# use the utils functions\r\nimport asreview.webapp.utils.project as proj\r\n# assign the necessary variables\r\ninfo = ['proj_id', ...]; data = 'loc_to_data'\r\n# add the project to asreview\r\nproj.init_project(*info)\r\n# manually add the dataset\r\nproj.add_dataset_to_project(info[0], data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore using the current setup, the VM was too weak and would give me a \"low memory\" error, but now with a stronger VM it simply stops training and doesn't even warn me that it had an error. \r\n\r\nBy running \"htop\", I see that the CPU activity stops after about 30 seconds.","closed_by":{"login":"ottomattas","id":15941300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15941300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomattas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
