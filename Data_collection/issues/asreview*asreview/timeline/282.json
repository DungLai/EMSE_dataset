agree with @qubixes that it was designed with a single user perspective. However, we did a multi-user test last week in which both users were training the same model. This was very stable and didn't require a modification of the code.  The downside is that it isn't clear who labeled the item. Two or more opinions per article isn't supported but sounds very interesting. \r\n\r\nI think there are multiple strategies for multi-user screening. Maybe it is good to make an overview of the different strategies and see what is doable to implement.
