There is a problem with allocating memory in the attributes of the state file for large queries like this. Hmmm. \r\n\r\n> We generally consider the maximum size of an attribute to be 64K bytes. The library has two ways of storing attributes larger than 64K bytes: in dense attribute storage or in a separate dataset. Using dense attribute storage is described in this section, and storing in a separate dataset is described in the next section.\r\n> \r\n> To use dense attribute storage to store large attributes, set the number of attributes that will be stored in compact storage to 0 with the H5Pset_attr_phase_change function. This will force all attributes to be put into dense attribute storage and will avoid the 64KB size limitation for a single attribute in compact attribute storage.\r\nhttp://davis.lbl.gov/Manuals/HDF5-1.8.7/UG/13_Attributes.html\r\n\r\nI can't think about an easy fix at the moment.
