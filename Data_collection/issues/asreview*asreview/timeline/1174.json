Diederick, I like the idea. It would be interesting to see how this performs. \r\n\r\nFrom a scientific perspective, seeing a small experiment or prototype on the performance would be nice. Are you interested in providing this? Feel free to reach out to the team or start a discussion here. I would also like to hear the input of other users about this progress metric. \r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective: we do not store the ranking for each reordering of the ranking. The ranking is overwritten. To make this technically work, we might have to build an option to store this ranking for each reorder. Or only the second last. @PeterLombaers can be involved in thinking about these technical requirements. \r\n\r\nI'm adding the `help wanted` tag to this issue. Anyone is welcome to share thoughts about this request or give it a try to implement/prototype something.
