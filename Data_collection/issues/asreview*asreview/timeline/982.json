It might help to see what is going on? See https://github.com/asreview/asreview-visualization\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty query strategy will select the most relevant records to train the model (e.g., close to a relevance score of .5) instead of presenting the most relevant ones, as with certainty-based sampling. So, you will not save any time by using this option, but you have trained a better model. This is the reason why the WSS@95 is low. \r\n\r\nI also noticed you have quite a large percentage of relevant documents (75 of 178). The system is optimized for finding a very small portion of relevant ones in a large pool of records, and 178 is not so many. \r\n\r\nSo, the above combination might have caused the WSS to become negative.
