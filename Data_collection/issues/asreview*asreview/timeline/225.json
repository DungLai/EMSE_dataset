The user can then easily import these files in a reference manager. \r\n\r\nAs this feature is currently not available yet, I found a workaround in the R-package `bib2df`. \r\nThis package is able to transform `.bib` files to tabular data (a format suitable for ASReview), and vice versa. \r\n\r\nI tried it out, and with this script I was able to convert the ASReview `.csv` export to three `.bib` files.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# load packages\r\nlibrary(bib2df)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n# load ASReview export (that was once transformed from bib to csv by bib2df)\r\nasreview_export_file <- \"~/Downloads/asreview_result_my-systematic-review.csv\"\r\nasreview_result <- read_csv(asreview_export_file) %>%\r\n  rename(Bibtexkey = bibtexkey,\r\n         AUTHOR = author,\r\n         Category = category)\r\n\r\n# split up in 3 datasets\r\nrelevant <- asreview_result %>% filter(label == 1)\r\nirrelevant <- asreview_result %>% filter(label == 0)\r\nunlabeled <- asreview_result %>% filter(is.na(label))\r\n\r\n# write to bib files \r\ndf2bib(relevant, \"~/Downloads/relevant.bib\")\r\ndf2bib(irrelevant, \"~/Downloads/irrelevant.bib\")\r\ndf2bib(unlabeled, \"~/Downloads/unlabeled.bib\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can open these datasets with your reference manager, for example in Zotero.\r\nIn Zotero, a record from this file looks like this: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"336\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45358236/101180125-777c1600-364b-11eb-8181-8b92090ccc2b.png\">\r\n\r\nThis simple script works quite well, however, I've identified a couple of problems: \r\n- Some parsing problems with column names, see the `rename` function I had to use\r\n- There is a problem with parsing multiple authors (they show up in one author field). This is probably quite easy to fix by transforming the authors into a list.\r\n- I wasn't able to import these files into endnote yet, but with some import filter, I think this should be possible. \r\n\r\nI invite anyone interested to test and improve this script. More info on the correct format can be found [here](http://127.0.0.1:24350/library/bib2df/doc/bib2df.html). \r\nAlso, help with testing the output files in other reference managers is more than welcome!
