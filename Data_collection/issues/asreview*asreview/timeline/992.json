Knowing which 'context \"\r\n              \"factors' help and hinder implementation of different changes \"\r\n              'would help implementers, as well as managers, policy makers, '\r\n              'regulators and purchasers of healthcare. It could help to judge '\r\n              'the likely success of possible improvements, given the '\r\n              'conditions that they have, and to decide which of these '\r\n              'conditions could be modified to make implementation more '\r\n              'effective. Methods The study presented in this paper examined '\r\n              'research to discover any evidence reported about whether or how '\r\n              'context factors influence the effectiveness of five patient '\r\n              'safety interventions.
