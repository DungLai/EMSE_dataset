there @franzbischoff , thanks for reporting the bug! \r\n \r\nWhat might have happened is that with loading the dataset, multiple datasets have overlapped each other! We'll look into how we can prevent this for future 😊 \r\n\r\nCould you check which version of the CORD-19 plugin you have? Or simply install the latest version with `pip upgrade asreview-covid19`?\r\n\r\nIf possible, create a new project and only use/click on one of the cord-datasets. It takes a while for some of them to load, because they're so large. If you want to use the other datasets as well, they would have to be in separate projects. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!
