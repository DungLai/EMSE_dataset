However, another use case is affected. When creating a new project in the first step, the `POST` API will be called once the title is filled and the text field loses focus, which means a project is initiated. It is not possible to change the mode after this action.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the frontend, the mode select is disabled after you move on to the second step. This is now affected by not allowing any change after the title text field loses focus (the project has been initiated).\r\n\r\nA specific question is whether we allow the change of mode during the setup (perhaps not limited to step 1). If we allow, we still need the `mode` option in the `PUT` API.\r\n\r\nA fundamental fix in the converter is
