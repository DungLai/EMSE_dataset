Steps are described below.\r\n\r\n1. I separated the record that is shown on the screenshots. I used EndNote 20 and kept only the record in question and one additional record to be able to train a model at a later stage. I then compressed the library:\r\n[ASR_note_debug_record.enlx.zip](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/files/8216451/ASR_note_debug_record.enlx.zip)\r\n\r\n2. I exported the record in RIS format, using EndNote 20:\r\n[ASR_note_debug_record.txt](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/files/8216388/ASR_note_debug_record.txt)\r\n\r\n3. I checked the notes (N1) field of the record in question in the RIS file:\r\n```\r\nN1  - Using Smart Source Parsing\r\nAgarwal, Sunita\r\nPatodia, Jyoti\r\nMittal, Jaikrishan\r\nSingh, Yatish\r\nAgnihotri, Vaibhav\r\nSharma, Varun\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. I uploaded the RIS file to ASReview, marked the record in question as irrelevant.\r\n5. I trained the model.\r\n6. I downloaded the results in RIS format:\r\n[asreview_result_944.ris.zip](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/files/8216478/asreview_result_944.ris.zip)\r\n\r\n7. I checked the notes (N1) field of the record in question in the RIS file:\r\n```\r\nN1  - Using Smart Source Parsing\r\nN1  - Agarwal, Sunita\r\nN1  - Patodia, Jyoti\r\nN1  - Mittal, Jaikrishan\r\nN1  - Singh, Yatish\r\nN1  - Agnihotri, Vaibhav\r\nN1  - Sharma, Varun\r\nN1  - ASReview_irrelevant\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. I imported the RIS file into a clean EndNote library and compressed it for sharing:\r\n[ASR_note_debug_record_asreview.enlx.zip](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/files/8216488/ASR_note_debug_record_asreview.enlx.zip)\r\n\r\n9. I compared the notes field of the record in question. I used the library from step 1 and from step 8:\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 18 45 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15941300/157489565-bf7ac4e4-9552-4464-ab92-659e4aaccfc3.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 18 46 11\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15941300/157489572-0980a1d6-0e04-4c35-8384-05c3edf5ca5f.png\">\r\n\r\n10.
