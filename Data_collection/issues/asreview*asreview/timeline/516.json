@Vaibhav-DTx You are right.

@MartijnUX! Thank you very much for replying with detailed answer and possibilities. \r\nYes, you're right, that \"X\" is good, but it does not clearly mean \"stop labelling and move to the next phase\". It may mean like \"cancel\". I was ignoring that for this reason. \r\nSo I would definitely upvote for the solution that you have suggested. If I may suggest one step further, and instead of \"STOP\", may be use \"FINISH\" or \"FINISHED\", or perhaps something more descriptive like \"Exit Oracle Mode\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the second part of my question, i.e. \"Train again\", what I meant was that there should be an option somewhere that allows me to re-run/resume/restart the training, after I have stopped labelling and performed one cycle of training.\r\nRight now, once I finish the training, and then if I click on the \"Start Reviewing\" button, on the project dashboard, I get the following screen to review further documents. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63007171/111498028-8047b200-8739-11eb-8ac8-f25f97317f6e.png)\r\n\r\nHere, there is no \"X\" or \"STOP\" as in the initial phase. It would be nice to have that \"STOP\" or \"FINISHED\" button here as well. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I thought, once I label a few more samples, I would be allowed to retrain the model. \r\nBut after several experiments, I have now understood that once the initial training is done, any further reviewing will only mean 'manually labelling a few more samples', and not necessarily a preparation for a new training with more 'knowledge' in terms of labelled samples. Am I right? Because, I only see the link to \"Download results\". \r\n\r\nIt would be really great if it is allowed to train the model again after this new labels. I guess, it will mean providing a link somewhere on the dashboard, to resume/restart/re-run the training and call the same module again. I hope I could transmit the idea clearly.\r\n \r\nThank you!

situated in multiple places within ASReview. During the multiple Usability Tests we didn't see any users having problems with that. Looking at it again, I think it is a good idea to give the user the possibility, while screening, to have the \"finish/stop screening\" option. That doesn't mean the user is going to download results, but just finishes screening (for this project) and goes back to the project dashboard. \r\nThank you @Vaibhav-DTx for your input!

think we lack an intuitive instruction on how to use ASReview. Although we have a rich documentation about every single element, no one really wants to read a detailed user manual, let alone a little tip buried somewhere. In this case, we gave the user (also ourselves) a feeling that the model was training during the prior knowledge labelling. However, in the setup stage, labelling prior knowledge won't train the model, meaning that \"stop/resume\" options can't be available. The model starts training only after clicking \"Finish\" in the last step.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you don't actually start reviewing in the labelling prior knowledge step. In this step, the documents presented to you are randomly selected (\"Random\" button means that). You just need to provide at least 1 relevant and 1 irrelevant records to give the model sufficient knowledge to start. Once you click \"Finish\", you will be able to see \"Start reviewing\". Then the model is ready to help you!\r\n\r\nThe choice of stopping or showing more in the labelling prior knowledge step will pop up after labelling every 5 random irrelevant records. It's just a reminder of sufficient irrelevant records for model training. However, this causes the confusion.\r\n\r\nI would suggest we may need a real \"quick tour\" to guide users through the process of creating, setting up, starting reviewing, finishing a project. This could be realised in two ways:\r\n- A guided tour of the app (eg. https://shepherdjs.dev). Technically it may require a lot work.\r\n- A video demonstration with text explanation for every step (maybe also euphonious bgm). Considering the fast iteration of ASReview, this may only be done for major releases.\r\n\r\nFor now, the easiest way to avoid confusion is to simply improve the texts in the prior knowledge labelling stage (eg. discard using the word \"stop\").\r\n\r\n@Rensvandeschoot I'd say a \"stop\" button after starting reviewing is more or less a user experience issue. Technically the model resumes/stops training after every labelling decision. When \"stop\" means finishing a project, we have an option in the project dashboard to mark a project as finished (also the option to undo). The important thing would be how we can convey this message to users.\r\n\r\n@Vaibhav-DTx Thanks for reporting this issue! We will improve the user experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/802745570/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"terrymyc","id":17449217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDQ5MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17449217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymyc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4481514603,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ4MTUxNDYwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/4481514603","actor":{"login":"Rensvandeschoot","id":36502709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36502709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot","html_url":"https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-19T11:01:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4481514613,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0ODE1MTQ2MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/4481514613","actor":{"login":"Rensvandeschoot","id":36502709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAyNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36502709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot","html_url":"https://github.com/Rensvandeschoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rensvandeschoot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-19T11:01:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4481514621,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ4MTUxNDYyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/4481514621","actor":{"login":"Vaibhav-DTx","id":63007171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDA3MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63007171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx","html_url":"https://github.com/Vaibhav-DTx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-19T11:01:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4481514630,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmli
