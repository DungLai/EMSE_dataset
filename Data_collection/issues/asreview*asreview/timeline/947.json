For example, every time the CORD19-dataset is [updated by Semantic Scholar ](https://ai2-semanticscholar-cord-19.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/historical_releases.html), it will be updated via [this script](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-covid19/blob/master/workflows/cord19_collect.py). \r\n\r\nYou could create your own plug-in using a [template ](https://github.com/asreview/template-extension-new-dataset), see for more options [the RTDs](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/extension_dev.html).
