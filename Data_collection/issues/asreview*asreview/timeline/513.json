I see two use cases. In the first, you already have a (partially) labeled set, and want to simulate in what order different models present this data to you. This is exactly what `asreview simulate` is for. You give the labeled dataset as input, and get a .h5 file as output. This .h5 file can for example be used to plot recall curves using `asreview-visualization`. If you want to try a different model, you run `asreview simulate` on the original  dataset, but with different settings, and you get a new .h5 file. \r\n\r\nIn the second, you want to get input from different models during the reviewing process. This would be a really cool feature indeed, and might be an efficient way to find the relevant records. It requires some real changes to the program though, especially if we want the keep the systematic review reproducable. But this is definitely an idea for the future!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/801106185/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PeterLombaers","id":71253799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjUzNzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71253799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterLombaers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterLombaers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4470433071,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ3MDQzMzA3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/4470433071","actor":{"login":"Vaibhav-DTx","id":63007171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDA3MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63007171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx","html_url":"https://github.com/Vaibhav-DTx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T14:02:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4470433109,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NzA0MzMxMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/4470433109","actor":{"login":"Vaibhav-DTx","id":63007171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDA3MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63007171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx","html_url":"https://github.com/Vaibhav-DTx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T14:02:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/801212179","html_url":"https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/513#issuecomment-801212179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/513","id":801212179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTIxMjE3OQ==","user":{"login":"Vaibhav-DTx","id":63007171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDA3MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63007171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx","html_url":"https://github.com/Vaibhav-DTx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vaibhav-DTx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T16:10:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03
