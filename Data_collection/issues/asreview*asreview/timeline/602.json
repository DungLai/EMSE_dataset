turns out there is a possibility that the file fails to open in ASReview due to formatting as [pointed out by rispy developers](https://github.com/MrTango/rispy/issues/38#issuecomment-843329956) and not encoding. In short, the file should have an entry which starts with a proper start tag **TY** (and end with **ER**).\r\n\r\n@behrica, could you maybe see if adjusting your RIS file's formatting allows you to open it in ASReview? We have some generic RIS files also available in our repo so you can see what differs between your and [the generic file](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/tests/demo_data/generic.ris).\r\n\r\nOn a side note - I am now wondering where this problematic file originates from? (e.g Is it from a website or an export from a relevant software we might want to support in the future,
