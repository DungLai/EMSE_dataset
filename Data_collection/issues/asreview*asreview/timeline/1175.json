@SuzanGipmans for documenting this feature request. It is interesting to see how we can export and reimport this information. For tabular export formats, like CSV and Excel, this shouldn't be hard; however, for RIS, this might be a bit more tricky. We can use the notes field. \r\n\r\nThis is an example of a RIS record. \r\n```\r\nTY  - GEN\r\nTI  - Record which is labeled \"relevant\" by the researcher using ASReview.\r\nN1  - Additional notes 0\r\nN1  - ASReview_relevant\r\nER  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can extend the note (N1) field, but not without using a hacky trick to prevent mixing up the original notes with the ASReview notes. (original notes can be notes from the original database). \r\n\r\nProposal 1: \r\n```\r\nTY  - GEN\r\nTI  - Record which is labeled \"relevant\" by the researcher using ASReview.\r\nN1  - Additional notes 0\r\nN1  - ASReview_relevant\r\nN1  - ASReview_note This is my note\r\nER  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposal 2: \r\n\r\nUsing a custom field (is this supported by reference managers?)\r\n\r\n```\r\nTY  - GEN\r\nTI  - Record which is labeled \"relevant\" by the researcher using ASReview.\r\nN1  - Additional notes 0\r\nN1  - ASReview_relevant\r\nC1  - This is my note\r\nER  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm welcoming all thoughts about this. I'm adding the `help wanted` tag; if anyone would like to implement this, go ahead :)
