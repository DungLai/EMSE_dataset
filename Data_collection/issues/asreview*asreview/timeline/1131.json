The output above was created in v1 oracle, the `mode` is `minimal`. This is as expected, as the mode is the legacy mode. Options for this mode are: \"minimal\" (for oracle and explore), and \"simulate\" for simulations. Apparently, there is also a \"base\" option. As this mode value is never used, as far as I know, we can remove it completely. I decided to give this a try in #1132.
