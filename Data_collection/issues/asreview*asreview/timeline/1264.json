@Rensvandeschoot, @J535D165, and @gimoAI,\r\n\r\nThank you all for your replies and I am sorry for my slow respons. To answer your questions above:  \r\n**_Could you describe how exactly you checked the ranking of the records?_**\r\nI adapted the code in the jobs.bat file and subsequently I ran it in the cmd (by double clicking the jobs.bat file). I just watched the index and order number projected in the cmd for each relevant article per simulation and they did not appear to change. \r\n\r\n**_Did you use the API to get [access](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_api_asreview_file.html) to the three datasets or did you export the datasets via the web version LAB?_**\r\nI used the API. I want to run all simulations with the same dataset. The only thing I want to change is the order in which the articles are presented to the simulator (or simulated reviewer). So just as clarification: I would like to see the variability without any prior knowledge. My hypothesis is that this will increase variation (as it may take long before the first relevant article is found), but time from first relevant until all relevant articles are found will be similar (or perhaps even quicker).\r\n\r\nBased on your comments I re-checked my data above and I figured out the following: When I re-run a jobs.bat file without first deleting the output, it may seem when just looking at the command prompt as if there is no prior knowledge (ASReview assuming same prior knowledge as in prior runs?). See the difference between the screenshot (just to be as clear as possible: both were run with the same code with one as first run and one directly followed without deleting the output).  I also tried to work with the --n_prior_included (-/excluded), but this gave an error as well. When I used the benchmark datasets of van_der_schoot_2017 and Kwok_2020 also one relevant and one irrelevant article was defined and I used exactly the same code as @J535D165 mentioned above and I adapted the benchmark set to Kwok_2020. @gimoAI, you mention it works fine for you, but does that mean that ASReview still defines prior knowledge during the random query strategy?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81418813/201710021-67926a5d-8e58-45e8-8ad9-526595b36f8f.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81418813/201710094-2515471c-586d-49d2-94fc-c20695c3aaaa.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**_jobs.bat file:_**\r\n@ echo off\r\nCOLOR E0\r\n:: version 0.5.1\r\n\r\n:: Create folder structure.
