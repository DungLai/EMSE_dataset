would be nice to have integrations indeed with other software packages. Nowadays, we support 4 types of file formats for exports. With those 4 formats, we are compatible with many external software solutions in our chain. It is also possible to write extensions for other file formats via custom entry points. \r\n\r\nI don't feel like integration with Distiller should be on our list for the upcoming months/years. Our efforts should be focused on integrations with FOSS software solutions like Zotero. Integrations like the one proposed are still welcomed but should be developed by the vendor itself or the community. Ideally as an external extension first such that we don't have to maintain it (I don't have access to their API and I'm not gonna pay for it ever). \r\n\r\nGiven the arguments above, I'm closing this issue. We are nevertheless open for discussion in this thread or via email.
