cause of the problem is that the CSV is malformed (opening it in LibreOffice Calc also goes wrong).\r\n\r\nFrom the [CSV format spec](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt):\r\n\r\n> 6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas\r\n       should be enclosed in double-quotes.\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n> 7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote\r\n       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with\r\n       another double quote.\r\n\r\nThis implies the following changes to the file:\r\n\r\n1. Both the \"title\" and \"authors\" fields must be wrapped in double quotes (see 6)\r\n\r\n2. Since the \"title\" field includes 2 double quote characters, both characters must be escaped\r\n   by preceding it with an additional double quote character (see 7).\r\n\r\nApplying this to your file results in:\r\n\r\n```csv\r\nrecord_id;title;abstract;keywords;authors;doi;included\r\n444919;\"\"\"Gescoopt\"\" risico management\";;;\"Jansen, H.J.M.\";https://url.com/gescoopt.pdf;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a check I tried to validate the resulting file with [CSVLint](https://csvlint.io/). Confusingly, CSVLint complains about an \"unexpected whitespace\". I suspect this might be a bug in CSVLint, because the file validates OK if I replace the semicolon delimiters by commas (perhaps CSVLint doesn't correctly identify the delimiter). The file is also imported correctly in LibreOffice Calc.\r\n\r\nBTW the  [\"How to Write Good CSV\" guide](https://csvlint.io/about) on the CSVLint website gives some useful information about common CSV pitfalls, so that might be worth a quick read.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/1016466073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitsgalore","id":1014449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore","html_url":"https://github.com/bitsgalore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitsgalore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/1016551400","html_url":"https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/919#issuecomment-1016551400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/919","id":1016551400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCdPKjs48l1fo","user":{"login":"erikvullings","id":3140667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDA2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3140667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings","html_url":"https://github.com/erikvullings","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvullings/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T15:00:46Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T15:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
