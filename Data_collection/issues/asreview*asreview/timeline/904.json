I want to assess the performance of different model combinations on my (labeled) datasets and am therefore using simulate-batch in order to account for sampling variance, similar to the simulation study of Ferdinands (2020). I am not familiar with bash programming or other methods that can help me do this faster, so to me, the simulate-batch function is useful because it is the easiest and straightforward method I know. Though I would be interested to know if you have any ideas/suggestions for others like me who have limited knowledge of bash (and Python) programming on how to do a simulation like this myself, or more broadly speaking, how to do a simulation study similar to that of Ferdinands using their own datasets?\r\n\r\nEdit: In other words, I'm wondering if the alternative you propose is as straightforward and intuitive as the current function feels to me now. But if deprecating the simulate-batch function is preferred by the developers and the alternative is well documented and as easy to use for laymen, then that seems reasonable to me too. I'm also curious to know why (don't) you think it still has a use case and whether you think using that function by doing a similar thing to Ferdinands in order to assess how well the tool performs and which combination of methods perform best on other kinds of datasets (e.g. in other research contexts) is a good use-case for it or if you have any other ideas on how to address such questions.

thanks for your elaborate answer. I assume you are referring to this simulation/file of the study by @GerbrichFerdinands: https://github.com/asreview/paper-simulation-smid-2020-mbr/blob/main/simulation_scripts.sh. \r\n\r\nWe are/have been experimenting with a tool to set up and run simulation studies. This tool provides researchers with many more options to simulate performance (compared to the simulate-batch feature). For example, this tool is can simulate all relevant records (instead of random selection). Currently, this tool is for internal use only. We are still improving the tool, documenting it, and we are preparing to make this tool public with the release of version 1 of ASReview LAB (first quarter of 2022). I hope this sounds good to you.
