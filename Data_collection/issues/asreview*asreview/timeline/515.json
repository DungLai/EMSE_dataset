It looks like an accident. Since the project was actually imported, I assume there was something wrong with switching to the project page of the imported one. The upcoming release will provide more information when errors happen. It will help us locate the error.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to have an option to replace the existing project instead of creating a copy. Our team will discuss the implementation of this feature.
