@jpeacock29,\r\n\r\nThis is how `Exploration` & `Simulation` mode are supposed to work! Both modes **do** detect existing prior knowledge in the dataset, when you click on \"add prior knowledge\" you will find that you can manually add prior knowledge and that the existing labels are shown. This is in contrast with `Oracle` mode where all prior knowledge is added automatically. This difference, has to do with the purpose of `Exploration` & `Simulation` mode:\r\n- **`Exploration`** is useful for teaching purposes because, while labeling, a blue bar is displayed on top of the record indicating whether the record has been labeled relevant or irrelevant in the dataset. If all prior knowledge would be detected and used automatically, then there would be nothing left to label and thus nothing left to \"explore\".\r\n- **`Simulation`** is used to simulate the process of reviewing records with ASReview. If all labels were recognized as prior knowledge, there would be nothing left of the reviewing process to simulate. In a real simulation you would probably want to select a few articles that you know to be relevant and irrelevant as a starting point, that is why you have to use \"Add prior knowledge\" to add some prior knowledge manually.\r\n\r\nDoes this answer your question?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/1266488419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gimoAI","id":65157657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTU3NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65157657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI","html_url":"https://github.com/gimoAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7513341099,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCdPKjs5TJXvEzwAAAAG_1Hyr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/7513341099","actor":{"login":"jpeacock29","id":6829540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjk1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6829540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29","html_url":"https://github.com/jpeacock29","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T06:57:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7513341106,"node_id":"SE_lADOCdPKjs5TJXvEzwAAAAG_1Hyy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/7513341106","actor":{"login":"jpeacock29","id":6829540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjk1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6829540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29","html_url":"https://github.com/jpeacock29","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpeacock29/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T06:57:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7515236044,"node_id":"AE_lADOCdPKjs5TJXvEzwAAAAG_8WbM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/7515236044","actor":{"login":"gimoAI","id":65157657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTU3NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65157657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI","html_url":"https://github.com/gimoAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T11:02:24Z","assignee":{"login":"gimoAI","id":65157657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTU3NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65157657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI","html_url":"https://github.com/gimoAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gimoAI/followers","
