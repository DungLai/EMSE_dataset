want to be able to do, with an AI in systematic review is to have an answer in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. We do an SR, starting from 1000 papers from a certain literature search\r\n2. Experts and AI pick 30 to be included\r\n3. We produce a output based on the 30 picked\r\n4. One year later(or 10 years later)  somebody comes with paper 1001, claiming that we forgot to look at it in the past (the search missed it, for example)\r\n5. Now we want to be able to tell, if the model we used in the past would have included or excluded the paper\r\n6. If \"excluded\" we are fine. If included we might need to \"reopen\" our output, if there is different evidence in the paper\r\nSpecifically, an answer like \"we don't know\" what would have happend, is not be acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are piloting as well to address screening as an MLT \"text classification\" probelm. And in there, we could in theory store the trained model and run it, one year later, on the new paper and we get an answer \"excluded\" or \"included\". From this comes the question to export and store the trained model.\r\nWe think as well about \"export\" here, as we want to shield ourselves from unpredicted changes in the review application. So ideally we can answer this question as well in 10 years after the SR was done.\r\n\r\nI am rather new to the concept of \"active learning\" as done by ASreview, so maybe I just misunderstand something.\r\n\r\nPoint 5) does not need to be a feature of ASReview, because it is a very rare case. But we would like to have archived all pieces, so that we COULD at least do it. Again, a classification model I could just store in archive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/646280762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"behrica","id":127361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica","html_url":"https://github.com/behrica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3459875662,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ1OTg3NTY2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/3459875662","actor":{"login":"behrica","id":127361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica","html_url":"https://github.com/behrica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-18T20:09:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3459875666,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0NTk4NzU2NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/events/3459875666","actor":{"login":"behrica","id":127361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica","html_url":"https://github.com/behrica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-18T20:09:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/646284768","html_url":"https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/283#issuecomment-646284768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/283","id":646284768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjI4NDc2OA==","user":{"login":"behrica","id":127361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica","html_url":"https://github.com/behrica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/behrica/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T20:18:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T20:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just looked at the code.
