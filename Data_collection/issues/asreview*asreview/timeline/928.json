This is confusing. `reviewFinished` was introduced to mark the project as finished. `review_finished` was introduced on review level to mark a review as finished during a simulation in the frontend. Simulation can take a lot of time and therefore need to run in the background. This helped to find the status. \r\n\r\nI feel like we need to rename `reviewFinished` into `projectFinished` (in line with `api_finish_project`) and `review_finished` into `reviewFinished`. Because there can be multiple reviews in one project, this property can be found multiple times. \r\n\r\nHowever, an alternative would be to leave `reviewFinished` as is. Change `review_finished` into `status`. Because this can have more values like `setup`, `running`, `finished`. \r\n\r\nI'm dropping some code here with references\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/902cd4de6b71d52afb921f36d62a946f01c3e351/asreview/webapp/utils/project.py#L318-L334\r\n\r\nThis looks odd to me.
