Sorry. I have doubled checked and reuploaded it.\r\n> \r\nNo worries, these things happen. Anyway, I recommend to move over to .xlsx if Excel is necessary. The older format .xls is not supported for many reasons. First and foremost, [Microsoft has stopped support for Office 2003 since 2014](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/support-has-ended-for-office-2003-c5118100-b738-4163-b7c1-b9c4fe5b6b90), and .xls was the default for Excel 2003.\r\n\r\nFor a quick remedy, you can turn your .xls files to .csv and use those with ASReview. Also, this should save some space on the drive.\r\n \r\n> This must be it. My VM is still too weak. You didn't change any parameters/configurations, right?\r\n\r\nThis might be the case so giving it time would solve the issue for now. I did not change any parameters or settings. I just ran the workflow on a clean install with some additional logging turned on for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\nFor the future - I would also consider limiting the scope of the search (and therefore the number of records). Of course, ASReview can technically handle these kind of heavy workloads but is it actually the best course of action for the researcher? I mean, having random records is very relevant. But how many is too many?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/922886738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ottomattas","id":15941300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15941300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomattas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/comments/922887723","html_url":"https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/742#issuecomment-922887723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asreview/asreview/issues/742","id":922887723,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCdPKjs43AiYr","user":{"login":"ottomattas","id":15941300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15941300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomattas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomattas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T12:35:04Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T12:35:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tlaso
