Export your search results as an `.nbib` file. To download the `.nbib` file you can follow these instructions: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#citation-management-software.\r\n2. Import this `.nbib` file to your reference manager (EndNote for example, which is also very useful for deduplicating search results and retrieving missing abstracts). \r\n3. Export the library from your reference manager in RIS format (For EndNote see these instructions for example: https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/c.php?g=829543&p=6602335)\r\n4.
