Refer to -> https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#ordering-comparisons\r\nThe ordering comparison operators (<, <=, >=, >) raise a TypeError exception when the operands don’t have a meaningful natural ordering. Thus, expressions like 1 < '', 0 > None or len <= len are no longer valid, and e.g. None < None raises TypeError instead of returning False. A corollary is that sorting a heterogeneous list no longer makes sense – all the elements must be comparable to each other. Note that this does not apply to the == and != operators: objects of different incomparable types always compare unequal to each other.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
