Is the model not very stable sometimes and need to tune the hyperparameters? Could you give me some advice for reproducing?\r\n\r\nMore specifically, i train for 13 epochs except the  attraction domain, the joint and turn acc are 9.2 and 87.5. Besides, for the BM excpet hotel, the fine-tuned results on 4 domains and new domain are (18.79  89.13) and (26.8  77.95).\r\n\r\nThanks for your code release!","closed_by":{"login":"jasonwu0731","id":14951842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTUxODQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14951842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonwu0731","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwu0731/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwu0731/trade-dst/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwu0731/trade-dst/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
