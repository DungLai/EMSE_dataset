You could also use the Author as another target categorical attribute for training. Therefore, I am afraid that content embeddings trained to predict who is the article author might not lead to good content representations for recommendation, compared to categories, which are defined by Editors and are in general very related to the article content. \r\nIs that clearer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/issues/comments/509067180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gabrielspmoreira","id":504752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielspmoreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielspmoreira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/issues/comments/509211151","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/issues/1#issuecomment-509211151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/issues/1","id":509211151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTIxMTE1MQ==","user":{"login":"zippeurfou","id":4520383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjAzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4520383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou","html_url":"https://github.com/zippeurfou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zippeurfou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T12:47:49Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T12:48:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @gabrielspmoreira for you answer.\r\nI was more thinking of using it as a metadata input feature for ACR training.\r\nFor example [you do not use it](https://github.com/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/blob/master/acr_module/acr/acr_trainer_adressa.py#L132) for the addressa ACR training but [it get passed to the NAR](https://github.com/gabrielspmoreira/chameleon_recsys/blob/master/acr_module/acr/acr_trainer_adressa.py#L169).
