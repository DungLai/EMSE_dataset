I was able to set up your code and got it working for the sample images (1024x436) you've provided. I wish to estimate the flow for images that are (512 x 384). I commented the following lines from your code:\r\n```\r\nassert(intWidth == 1024)\r\nassert(intHeight == 436)\r\n```\r\nAnd ran it, but I'm getting the following error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"run.py\", line 379, in <module>\r\n    tenOutput = estimate(tenFirst, tenSecond)\r\n  File \"run.py\", line 356, in estimate\r\n    tenPreprocessedFirst = tenFirst.cuda().view(1, 3, intHeight, intWidth)\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: shape '[1, 3, 384, 512]' is invalid for input of size 786432\r\n```\r\nCould you kindly advise me on how to fix this? Do we have to modify the architecture of the network, if we are only testing it out? \r\nThank you, \r\nAbhinav\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
