It seems that gradient become nan at the `foward` block.\r\n\r\nIf I change line 279 to `tensorDifference = (tensorFirst - tensorSecond).pow(2.0).sum(1, True).sqrt()\r\n` loss never becomes \"nan\".\r\n\r\nI am kind of having hard time with the code because I've never used pytorch (I am getting it though).\r\nDo you have any idea about this?\r\nThank you\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
