I first examined the Caffe model defined in the prototxt. In doing so, I always find [Netscope](https://dgschwend.github.io/netscope/quickstart.html) to be quite handy. All that was left to do then was to load the pre-trained Caffe weights in the PyTorch model. To do so, I used [loadcaffe](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe) to load the Caffe weights and to store them as Torch weights. I was then finally able to use [torchfile](https://github.com/bshillingford/python-torchfile) to load the Torch weights in PyTorch. There probably is a more direct approach though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/comments/538258670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2686321963,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY4NjMyMTk2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/events/2686321963","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-04T06:26:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/comments/539418038","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/19#issuecomment-539418038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/19","id":539418038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTQxODAzOA==","user":{"login":"abrosua","id":36978454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTc4NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36978454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua","html_url":"https://github.com/abrosua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T08:52:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T08:52:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your suggestion!
