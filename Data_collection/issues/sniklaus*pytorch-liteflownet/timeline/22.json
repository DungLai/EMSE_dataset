You can also decide not to do the normalization. If you decide to do the normalization, which is probably a good idea, then you need to make sure that the normalization during inference is the same as during training.\r\n2. I would recommend you learn these values (PyTorch parameters), just like the original LiteFlowNet did. You could also pre-compute these values (average mean and maybe even the average standard deviation), which is how it is commonly done for image classification (and you already seem to have those values anyway).\r\n\r\nYou could also try to see what happens if you use the provided model but you update the normalization with the mean from your dataset. Maybe that yields better results for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/comments/560239172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2844331183,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg0NDMzMTE4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/events/2844331183","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-02T05:35:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/comments/560263365","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/22#issuecomment-560263365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-liteflownet/issues/22","id":560263365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDI2MzM2NQ==","user":{"login":"abrosua","id":36978454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTc4NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36978454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua","html_url":"https://github.com/abrosua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrosua/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T07:10:29Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T07:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the recommendations.\r\n\r\nSuppose that I want to impose photometric augmentation (i.e., contrast, brightness, gaussian noise, etc) to the dataset for the training procedure.
