So I use the \"track editor\" in the Beamng.tech to build a track in the \"smallgrid\"map. The track is as follows.\r\n![635584dbf72a14d21533cfded323574](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54585256/179357983-a8b6779c-4958-470f-8c23-cde396305f48.png)\r\nHowever, the track can not be saved in this level. So I can not use the code `scenario = Scenario('smallgrid', 'example')` to load this track in beamngpy.\r\n\r\nI find a json file of that track(scenario_sn.json). I wonder：\r\n1. If there is a way to use world editor to save the track in this level，then beamngpy can load the level to get the track.\r\n2. If there is a way to let beamngpy read the track data(i.e. the json file as image below) to rebuild the track.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54585256/179358312-a63f7887-8b87-4eff-8b2e-2104c5a9824b.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"naner34","id":54585256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTg1MjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54585256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34","html_url":"https://github.com/naner34","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
