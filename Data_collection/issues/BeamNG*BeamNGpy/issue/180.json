As follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, the vehicle is define at position (0,0,0)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscenario = Scenario('smallgrid', 'example')\r\nvehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800', licence='PYTHON')\r\nelectrics = Electrics()\r\nvehicle.attach_sensor('electrics', electrics)\r\ntimer = Timer()\r\nvehicle.attach_sensor('timer', timer)\r\nscenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(0, 0, 0), rot=None, rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I can pull the sensors data and output the data.\r\n```python\r\nsensors = beamng.poll_sensors(vehicle)\r\ntimeNow = sensors['timer']['time']\r\nposNow = sensors[\"state\"]['pos']\r\ndirNow = sensors[\"state\"]['dir']\r\nwheelspeed = sensors['electrics']['wheelspeed']\r\nthrottle = sensors['electrics']['throttle']\r\nsteering = sensors['electrics']['steering']\r\nbrake = sensors['electrics']['brake']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe part of the output is shown as follows. From here, it can be found that the vehicle's position (-0.     0.001  0.186)  here is not same as what I defined before (0, 0, 0). It really troubles me a lot.   And I also have the following doubts about the meaning of other properties.\r\n1. Is \"dir\" the moving direction of the vehicle? The scene level I use is \"smallgrid\" and the ground in this scene looks flat. Why time is 0, the z coordinate value of dir is not 0？\r\n2. Is \"wheelspeed\" the speed  of the rear wheels?\r\n3. Is the correspondence between \"steering\" and steering wheel angle linear? \r\n4. Why is the \"brake\" value not 0 when t=0 (Vehicle does not start)? \r\n```\r\n'time', 'pos', 'dir', 'wheelspeed', 'throttle', 'steering', 'brake'\r\n0\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t-0.0\t0.3\r\n0.041\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t0.0\t0.3\r\n0.081\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t0.0\t0.3\r\n0.122\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t-0.0\t0.3\r\n0.162\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t-0.0\t0.3\r\n0.202\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t-0.0\t0.3\r\n0.243\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t0.0\t0.3\r\n0.283\t[-0.     0.001  0.186]\t[-0.    -1.    -0.011]\t0.0\t0\t0.0\t0.3\r\n```\r\nLooking forward for a reply.
