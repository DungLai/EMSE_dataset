However when I tried to call  `callFoo(bng)` function (and other call functions), it stuck without dumping anything. I checked out the BeamNG.tech console finding it reports like this:\r\n![errorlog1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49221140/129853950-a0dba426-a81b-4e84-bbeb-3d9ab9074479.png)\r\n\r\nAnd after I forced to close the game connection, the python console reported like this:\r\n```\r\npath\\to\\Anaconda3\\envs\\bng-dev\\lib\\site-packages\\beamngpy-1.20-py3.7.egg\\beamngpy\\beamngcommon.py in recv_msg(skt)\r\n    251         The decoded message.\r\n    252     \"\"\"\r\n--> 253     length = skt.recv(16)\r\n    254     length = int(str(length, 'ascii'))\r\n    255     buf = bytearray()\r\n\r\nConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this problem is related to #86 and #89, but I can't find what caused this problem.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
