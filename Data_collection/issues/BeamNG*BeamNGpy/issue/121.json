(rad/s for rotation? Newtons for linear force?)\r\nb) The force reported uses the mass of the vehicle or it just represents the acceleration? (If so, is it reporting m/s^2?)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
