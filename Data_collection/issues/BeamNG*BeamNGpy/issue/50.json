For example, their color, their components (wheels, spoilers, etc). This can be used to create rich driving simulations while keeping the overall computational cost low (to some extent, the traffic plugin does this). As @pascale-commits says, while spawning a vehicle, color attributes can be defined on-the-fly, which is good; however, I wonder if there's the possibility to change some attributes of cars also without respawning them. \r\n\r\n> Why this might be important/relevant?\r\n\r\nBecause the user does not have to \"recompute\" or respawn the vehicle in the exact condition every time just to change\r\nan attribute that does not impact the physics of the vehicle itself (i.e., color). Said in other words, the user should not do the work of the simulator and replace moving vehicles on the fly.\r\n\r\n> What attributes can be effectively (easily) changed of a vehicle?\r\n\r\nI understand that color is one of such attributes, but what about skins, the color of wheels/rims, windshield, etc.? I assume that any other modification will impact somehow accurately simulating the physics (i.e., the aerodynamics of the car, type/size/material of the wheels, etc.).","closed_by":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
