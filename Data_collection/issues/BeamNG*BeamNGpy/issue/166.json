Certain sensors like the simulated LiDAR or camera will not work, but most of the functions that are not exclusive to a Tech build will likely work.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot get it to work. It seems that it fails to load the util_researchGE extension and with that the game will not respond on the API port 64256. I tried to follow earlier reported (now closed) issues on how to manually set up a workspace, but it does not seem to work for me. Is that the reason why the util_researchGE extension does not work?
