There is a teleport vehicle function and I tried to do the same for objects but it didn't work. Is there a way to update object positions?\r\n\r\nBackground: I need to control traffic lights but the wca level uses a png file to change the light of traffic light colors, which can't be controlled dynamically by the code. I also couldn't find a way to add lights (e.g. PointLight) only using beamngpy. That's why I thought about adding a red, yellow and green ProceduralRing object which should jump to the right position.","closed_by":{"login":"masskro0","id":49821640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODIxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49821640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0","html_url":"https://github.com/masskro0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
