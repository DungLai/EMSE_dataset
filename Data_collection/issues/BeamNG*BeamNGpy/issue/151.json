This includes also the `state` sensors which is a default sensor attached to it.\r\n\r\nThis breaks our code that reuses the same Vehicle object across simulations; however, I am not sure how we should handle this case: should we forbid the reuse of Vehicle objects or should ensure that the `state` sensor is never detached? Also, IMHO no sensors should be attached by default as this breaks the API, e.g., why State sensor should be different from any other sensor?)","closed_by":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
