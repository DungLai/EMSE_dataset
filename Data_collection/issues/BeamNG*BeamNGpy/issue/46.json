This might be achieved by declaring a number of Camera components, or maybe by pausing the simulation and taking all the screenshots with the same camera sensor (but under different configurations), however, a nice meta-sensor/sensor that gets a list of configuration might be easier to use? Such a sensor might be also configured to generate random pose/rotations of the camera while the camera points towards the same point?","closed_by":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
