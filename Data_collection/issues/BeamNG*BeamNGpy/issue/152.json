Unfortunately, I was not able to configure it properly, for example, by setting an appropriate log level.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I have at the moment is to get a handle on the BeamNG's loggers at runtime and completely disable them. Maybe a better solution is to have a way to configure the loggers during instantiation or at runtime?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
