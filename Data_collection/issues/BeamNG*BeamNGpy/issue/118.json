I noticed that there is a function, `ai_set_waypoint`, that is designed for this purpose. However, this function takes in a string (for example, `Bridge4_B`), which I assume represents some waypoint on the map.  The problem is I can't find where these strings are defined, nor what positions they represent.\r\n\r\nWhere are these strings defined? Also, is there a way to send this function waypoints defined as a tuple or array?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"hildebrandt-carl","id":26097148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDk3MTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26097148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl","html_url":"https://github.com/hildebrandt-carl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
