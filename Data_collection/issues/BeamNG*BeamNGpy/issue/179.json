Unfortunately this map dosen't have any annotation information so I'm looking at adding pre-existing annotation info from `annotations.json` to these maps.\r\n\r\nI've been able to find references to material annotations in `main.materials.json` files that are provided with Beam maps by default like so: `\"annotation\": \"STREET\"`. I've then tried extending my custom levels `main.materials.json` in a similar way but seemingly to no affect. Could I get some clarification surrounding how to add custom annotations to maps.\r\n\r\nI've attached some screenshots showing what I'm seeing on a properly annotated map vs incorrectly annotated custom maps below:\r\n\r\n![camAnno](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19365577/177834209-13e67744-c87c-4388-a905-d6aed8d3f529.png)\r\n![1657199749513](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19365577/177834313-e042a48e-3838-4528-ad9a-e9afe407a5d1.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MatousKundrik","id":19365577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzY1NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19365577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik","html_url":"https://github.com/MatousKundrik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatousKundrik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
