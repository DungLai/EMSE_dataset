The game does launch, but it doesn't connect to the server.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle\r\n\r\n# Instantiate BeamNGpy instance running the simulator from the given path,\r\n# communicating over localhost:64256\r\nbng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256, home=\"S:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BeamNG.drive\", user=\"C:/beamng_workspace_0.23\")\r\n# Launch BeamNG.tech\r\nbng.open()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nNo workspace set up at userpath: <C:\\beamng_workspace_0.23>\r\nSetup is required prior to mod deployment.\r\nERROR:root:Error connecting to BeamNG.tech. 25 tries left.\r\nERROR:root:[WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\envs\\beamng-env\\lib\\site-packages\\beamngpy\\beamng.py\", line 512, in connect\r\n    self.skt.connect((self.host, self.port))\r\nConnectionRefusedError: [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it\r\n\r\n...
