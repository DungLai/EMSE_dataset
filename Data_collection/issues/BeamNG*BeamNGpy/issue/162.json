Isn't the lidar max range 200 by default?\r\n\r\nWhat does these values represent ?\r\nDo you have a clue how I can get the point supposed to be the closest one? I'll do the 3D math by myself afterward.","closed_by":{"login":"ASionville","id":57773476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzczNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57773476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville","html_url":"https://github.com/ASionville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
