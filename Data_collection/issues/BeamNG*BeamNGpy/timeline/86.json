For now its not planned to expose this function through BeamNGpy. \r\n\r\nBut we will provide you the lua code, so that you can write your own extension :)\r\n\r\nSome notes on the following lua code:\r\n- the function you can use computes a path based on \"nodes\" in the map, they are different from a position vector \r\n- it is possible to get the closest nodes that define a road segment from any given position, but since there are two of them, one might be \"behind\" the vehicle \r\n- the following code runs in the vehicle VM, not in the game engine\r\n- if you are not sure on how to approach writing an extension, see this tutorial on [how to connect your own lua code to BeamNGpy](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/dev/examples/modInterface/usingmodsWithBNGpy.ipynb) (be sure to check out the dev version, the one in master has no explanation)\r\n\r\n```\r\nmapmgr.requestMap() --initialize the map (if you initialized the AI beforehand you might not need this line)\r\nstartPos = vec3(obj:getPosition()) -- get current vehicle position as starting point\r\ngoalPos = vec3(156, 756, 123) -- some random values that represent the goal\r\nstartNodeA, startNodeB = mapmgr.findClosestRoad(startPos) -- returns two node names \r\ngoalNodeA, goalNodeB = mapmgr.findClosestRoad(goalPos) \r\nnodePath = mapmgr.getPath(startNodeA, goalNodeA, 0, 5, 8, 8) -- this returns a list of path nodes aka strings\r\nprint(mapmgr.map.nodes[nodePath [1]].pos) -- this is how you access the coordinates for the first node in the path\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/725502124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/725654961","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/86#issuecomment-725654961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/86","id":725654961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTY1NDk2MQ==","user":{"login":"ASionville","id":57773476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzczNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57773476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville","html_url":"https://github.com/ASionville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-11T20:51:44Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T20:53:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok,

to reopen the issue but there are a few questions about the extension :\r\n - Is the code that you sent above enough to write the 1st point coordinates ?\r\n - In what folder should I put the file ?\r\n - How should I call it, main.lua ?\r\n\r\nThanks

I don't understand your first question. But I think you might find your answer if you run the code in the game's command line. It should appear if you use the key with the `~`, but that might vary, depending on your keyboard settings. If you need to know the content of a variable, then call `dump(someVar)`. If you want to know what functions an object has then use `getmetatable(someObject)`. If you changed your code and want to reload lua (without restarting the game) on the ge side use `Ctrl+L`, for the ve side of your current vehicle use `Ctrl+R`.\r\n\r\nYou can put it in the game's directory: `/lua/vehicle/extension/<yourModName>.lua`. Then you will also have to add another line in the `/lua/vehicle/main.lua`: `extensions.load('yourModName')` and it is then available through `extensions.yourModName`. I encourage you to go through the tutorial once more and read though its explanations :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/727857089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/731647738","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/86#issuecomment-731647738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/86","id":731647738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTY0NzczOA==","user":{"login":"ASionville","id":57773476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzczNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57773476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville","html_url":"https://github.com/ASionville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-21T22:43:36Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T23:02:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
