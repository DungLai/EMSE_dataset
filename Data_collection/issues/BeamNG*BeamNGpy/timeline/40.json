It requires you to spawn vehicles you want to participate in traffic yourself, however, but spawning vehicles after the scenario was started was already supported (if you call `add_vehicle` on a loaded scenario, it spawns it at runtime.) I'll probably write an example at some point but for now the unit test for it shows an example use: https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/tests/test_vehicle.py#L254\r\n\r\nDocs here: https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/beamngpy.html#beamngpy.beamng.BeamNGpy.start_traffic\r\n\r\nThis version also added a method to query the game about available vehicles to make this easier, so you can ask the game for available vehicles and randomly select some to spawn:
