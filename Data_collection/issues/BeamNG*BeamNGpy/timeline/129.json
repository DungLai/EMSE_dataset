It took a couple of extra steps:\r\n\r\n1) I added an empty `researchHelpher.txt` to `c:\\beamng_workspace_0.23\\` (ie. not in the `0.23` subfolder) \r\n2) Then ran this script from `c:\\a-different-path\\readme_example.py`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle\r\n\r\nfrom beam_al.config import Config\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    # Instantiate BeamNGpy instance running the simulator from the given path,\r\n    # communicating over localhost:64256\r\n    bng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256, home=\"s:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BeamNG.drive\", user=\"C:/beamng_workspace_0.23\")\r\n    # Launch BeamNG.tech\r\n    bng.open()\r\n    # Create a scenario in west_coast_usa called 'example'\r\n    scenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'example')\r\n    # Create an ETK800 with the licence plate 'PYTHON'\r\n    vehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800', licence='PYTHON')\r\n    # Add it to our scenario at this position and rotation\r\n    scenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(-717, 101, 118), rot=None, rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))\r\n    # Place files defining our scenario for the simulator to read\r\n    scenario.make(bng)\r\n\r\n    # Load and start our scenario\r\n    bng.load_scenario(scenario)\r\n    bng.start_scenario()\r\n    # Make the vehicle's AI span the map\r\n    vehicle.ai_set_mode('span')\r\n    input('Hit enter when done...')\r\n```\r\n3) This didn't work, but it did dump out `BeamNGpy.zip` to `c:\\a-different-path\\mods\\beamNGpy.zip`. I copied this zip into `C:\\beamng_workspace_0.23\\0.23\\mods` and reran the script, and the AI is now happily driving around.\r\n\r\nI think the reason the `.zip` was written where it was is because `BeamNGpy.read_effective_userpath()` returns the contents of the empty file as `''`. Presumably that file usually contains a path?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/875783955/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"garethjns","id":7212290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTIyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7212290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns","html_url":"https://github.com/garethjns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garethjns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/876243346","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/129#issuecomment-876243346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/129","id":876243346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NjI0MzM0Ng==","user":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-08T08:30:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T08:30:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes,
