The material system in particular isn't as simple as putting everything related into one texture. Furthermore, we are actually slowly phasing out the DAE format, so work on that front would soon be obsolete.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we already do have a basic GLTF *exporter*, but the engine hasn't been switched to use those for vehicles/objects, so it's basically only one way. You could, however, export to GLTF, convert that to DAE and use that in the meantime. It would also not include any of the textures, due to the complications mentioned above. Hacky, but if it works it works. \r\n\r\n![blender_0kFs8DDkW9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37553150/86463408-b79e3c00-bd2d-11ea-9f35-baa2d2e35ed4.png)\r\n\r\nIf a vehicle looking like this as a placeholder is good enough for your case, you can manually export a vehicle as a GLTF by adding the GLTF exporter UI app from the UI apps menu. If that works for you I can also expose that function to Python.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/653492300/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3513511441,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUxMzUxMTQ0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/3513511441","actor":{"login":"masskro0","id":49821640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODIxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49821640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0","html_url":"https://github.com/masskro0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masskro0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-05T17:28:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
