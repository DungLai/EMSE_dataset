took a look at the code and found that it is as follows:\r\n\r\nFor roads defined in the game, you can retrieve the following properties of a DecalRoad through the get_roads() function:\r\n- 'drivability'\r\n- 'lanesLeft'\r\n- 'lanesRight'\r\n- 'oneWay'\r\n- 'flipDirection'\r\n\r\nThe other properties masskro0 mentioned can only be accessed through _get_roads_list() if you choose to create an additional road for the scenario with the help of the add_road() method and Road class. \r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using private functions, such as _get_roads_list()\r\n\r\nHope that helps
