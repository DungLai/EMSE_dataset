However the code is mostly written with the Python side acting as the server, BeamNG.drive as the client. In hindsight this was a mistake I made early on, but it's one I have to deal with now so it could take a bit to rework everything to allow multiple concurrent clients.\r\n\r\nYou are right in that it would probably be easier to have this for vehicles, since they already have their own connection, but there are some functions of the vehicle that actually happen on the game engine side and Python \"fakes\" as being part of  the vehicle to have a nicer API. For example, cameras are rendered from the game engine, of course, so a vehicle's camera sensor actually asks the engine side for that data. If vehicle and engine have different connections, that falls apart.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/638182318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3402053222,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNDAyMDUzMjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/3402053222","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T13:03:14Z","assignee":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/791381268","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/48#issuecomment-791381268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/48","id":791381268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTM4MTI2OA==","user":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T12:12:52Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T12:12:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added
