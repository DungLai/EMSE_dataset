Also it seems you encounter a multiple issues, it would be much easier to investigate if you try to create a smaller separate snippet of code for every issue you encounter.\r\n\r\nI'll try to address the problems you seem to be having:\r\n1. speed of AI is low before overtaking\r\n    Not sure if you mean the response time of AI, or the speed of the AI vehicle. You can try increasing the time between sensor polling (`time.sleep(0.5)` for example) if you still experience the simulator lagging. Another possible reason could be your hardware is not sufficient enough.\r\n2. after the AI vehicle overtakes, it moves strangely, with a sinusoidal-like trajectory\r\n    This could be a bug on the simulation side. Could you try to isolate a smaller code example of when this behaviour happens and post it either here or as a new issue?\r\n3. I want to slow down the AI vehicle\r\n    You can use the function [Vehicle.ai_set_speed](https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/beamngpy.html#beamngpy.vehicle.Vehicle.ai_set_speed) for setting the target speed of the AI vehicle, like in this snippet:\r\n```python\r\nveh_auto1.ai_set_speed(10, mode='limit')\r\n```\r\nThe speed is in m/s, and the mode can be either `limit` or `set`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1287147192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
