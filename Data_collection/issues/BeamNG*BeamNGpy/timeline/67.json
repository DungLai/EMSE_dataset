right, I can't resolve this problem at the moment, but if you need this functionality I can give you  sort of a hot fix which you can copy and paste into your local beamngpy installation.\r\n\r\nIn your virtual environment (if you've used `python -m venv...`, but anaconda should have a similar setup), you can find researchVE.lua in the following path: <venv root dir>/Lib/site-packages/beamngpy/lua/researchVE.lua\r\n\r\nIn line 168 (if you are up to date with master) should be this code snippet:\r\n`sensorHandlers.Electrics = function(msg)`\r\n `local resp = {type = 'Electrics'}`\r\n `resp['values'] = electrics.values`\r\n `return resp`\r\n`end`\r\n\r\nwhich you can replace with this:\r\n`sensorHandlers.Electrics = function(msg)`\r\n`local resp = {type =
