Thanks @alessiogambi for pointing me in the right direction. I was still using an older version of BeamNG that did not allow the specification of a `user` workspace. For anyone else who runs into this issue, here is how to solve it:\r\n\r\nNote: While I was writing this up, I noticed [this example](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/examples/multi_client.ipynb). I haven't looked at it. But it seems to be doing exactly what I spend the last little bit figuring out.\r\n\r\nMy solution: I was running the following versions\r\nBeamNG version: **BeamNG.tech.v0.23.5.1**\r\nBeamNGpy version: **1.21.1**\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed everything you need to create two user workspaces. You can do that you need to follow [this part of the readme](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy#usage). However basically what you need to do is:\r\n1) Create an environment variable called `BNG_HOME`. You can do that by:\r\nEdit the system environment variables -> Environment Variables -> System Variables (NEW)  \r\nVaribale Name: BNG_HOME \r\nVariable Value: C:\\<insert path here>\\BeamNG.tech.v0.23.5.1\r\n\r\n2) Create both workspaces by:\r\nRestarting the terminal (if you have just created the environment variable) and run:\r\n```bash\r\n# Workspace 1\r\nmkdir C:\\<insert path here>\\BeamNGWorkspace\r\ncd C:\\<insert path here>\\\r\nbeamngpy setup-workspace .\\BeamNGWorkspace\\\r\n# Workspace 2\r\nmkdir C:\\<insert path here>\\BeamNGWorkspace2\r\ncd C:\\<insert path here>\\\r\nbeamngpy setup-workspace .\\BeamNGWorkspace2\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are now all good to go. All you now need to do is update the `port` and the `user` parameters when calling `BeamNGpy`. Here is an updated example from the readme (which I called `basic_drive.py`):\r\n```python\r\nimport argparse\r\n\r\nfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle\r\n\r\n# Get the user defined arguments\r\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\nparser.add_argument('--port', type=int, default=64256, help=\"The port used to connect.\")\r\nparser.add_argument('--workspace', type=str, default=\"BeamNGWorkspace\", help=\"The name of the workspace folder\")\r\nargs = parser.parse_args()\r\n\r\n# Get BeamNG's location and workspace\r\nbng_loc = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\carl\\\\Documents\\\\Beamng\\\\BeamNG.tech.v0.23.5.1'\r\nbng_usr = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\carl\\\\Documents\\\\Beamng\\\\' + args.workspace\r\n\r\n# Launch BeamNG\r\nbng = BeamNGpy('localhost', args.port, home=bng_loc, user=bng_usr)\r\nbng.open()\r\n\r\n# Create a scenario in west_coast_usa called 'example'\r\nscenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'example')\r\n\r\n# Create an ETK800 with the license plate 'PYTHON'\r\nvehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800', licence='PYTHON')\r\n\r\n# Add it to our scenario at this position and rotation\r\nscenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(-717, 101, 118), rot=None, rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))\r\n\r\n# Place files defining our scenario for the simulator to read\r\nscenario.make(bng)\r\n\r\n# Load and start our scenario\r\nbng.load_scenario(scenario)\r\nbng.start_scenario()\r\n\r\n# Make the vehicle's AI span the map\r\nvehicle.ai_set_mode('span')\r\ninput('Hit enter when done...')\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run multiple copies all you need to do is simply open two terminals and run:\r\nTerminal 1\r\n```bash\r\npython .\\basic_drive.py --port 64256 --workspace BeamNGWorkspace\r\n```\r\n\r\nTerminal 2\r\n```bash\r\npython .\\basic_drive.py --port 64257 --workspace BeamNGWorkspace2\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should then have two simulators up and running as seen
