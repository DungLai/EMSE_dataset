The data from that will be more accurate, and you will be able to specify your own coordinate system for it to measure in.  These things are a work in progress, and will improve with better modelling as time goes on.\r\n\r\nRegarding the GForces error: what you have shown there looks like a socket bug.  This happens when we try to send data between the simulator and BeamNGpy, and there is a miscommunication between the two. It would be useful to see if there is any corresponding output on the python console window when this error occurs.  If this has happened repeatedly, this is likely a bug at our end which we can investigate.  Regarding the GForces sensor, I am actually not sure what state it is in myself, so I would need to take a look.  It may be incomplete.\r\n\r\nRegarding your question about pitch, roll, yaw, heave etc...  The simulator typically deals with more raw geometric quantities such as positions, directions, velocities, accelerations etc.  Certainly pitch, roll and yaw can be computed from looking at changes in the vehicle pose (ie the vehicle position, the forward vector, up vector etc).  The others you describe (translational motions) could be computed with some post-processing, by looking at changes in the vehicle position over time, then resolving them to the vehicles axes (forward, up, right).  This is just a guess - I am no expert on how people typically compute these quantities, or in what units you would want them etc.  For example though, on a flat surface, you might be able to compute the 'heave' of a vehicle simply by looking at how the elevation of the vehicle changes over time.  \r\nThe 'sensor' which contains all currently available data like this (position, direction, velocity etc) is called the State sensor, and every vehicle has one of these by default, so when you poll the sensors, the latest data will be available to you in your python script.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBeamNG Tech Team.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1221820647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dstark481","id":94687751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaTSBw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94687751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481","html_url":"https://github.com/dstark481","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1222498701","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/186#issuecomment-1222498701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/186","id":1222498701,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCEke6s5I3dmN","user":{"login":"mayureshb7","id":99101076,"node_id":"U_kgDOBegplA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99101076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7","html_url":"https://github.com/mayureshb7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayureshb7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T15:13:05Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T15:13:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response and all the answers.\r\n\r\nI will wait for the acceleration sensor and the new update you're bringing.\r\nThe GForces error is a frequent error that I get whenever I try to run the code.
