However, I recommend using the more powerful `ai_set_script` function which uses [BeamNG.drive's ScriptAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27s&v=11c2lUiPKqw) for driving around. The main difference to `_line` is that, instead of position and *speed*, you define a line by a position and a target *time*, which also allows you to specify lines where the vehicle stops at a certain point â€” something not really possible with `ai_set_line`. There's an example of how to use `ai_set_script` here: https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/examples/ai_line.py\r\n\r\nWith api reference here: https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/beamngpy.html#beamngpy.vehicle.Vehicle.ai_set_script","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/505315552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/505319732","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/25#issuecomment-505319732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/25","id":505319732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTMxOTczMg==","user":{"login":"tariqsameed","id":49558508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTU4NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49558508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed","html_url":"https://github.com/tariqsameed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tariqsameed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T07:18:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T07:30:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Actually, I want to drive the vehicle between the polyline at a constant speed.  It seems to me that `ai_set_line` will be the most appropriate solution in my case.  I don't want to define the time to reach the destination point. I believe that it should be automatically handled by BeamNG itself.  if possible, please update the documentation of `ai_set_line` so I can run both examples of `ai_set_script.` and `ai_set_line`  What are the changes you have made it `ai_set_line`. \r\n\r\nIs there anything in BeamNG that leaves the car in the free state. I mean, let suppose the car is driving at 35 kph with the throttle, braking and suddenly I want to leave the paddles and steering to see where the car can go without the interference of human being.
