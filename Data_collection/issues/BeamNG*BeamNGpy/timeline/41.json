However, I cannot understand why my script triggers such behavior. My Ai Script is defined starting from the current position of the car but somehow the car is moved back by some distance? The only idea I have is that the car cannot reach the point in time for some reason so it needs more space to drive? But in this case, why not driving slower?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/615314227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alessiogambi","id":1557512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1557512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi","html_url":"https://github.com/alessiogambi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/615322590","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/41#issuecomment-615322590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/41","id":615322590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTMyMjU5MA==","user":{"login":"alessiogambi","id":1557512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1557512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi","html_url":"https://github.com/alessiogambi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T15:51:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T15:51:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can explain this behavior as follow: in my code, I do not specify the initial dir and the up dir so BeamNGpy infers them from the first two nodes of the script, which happen to be placed on a turn in my case.
