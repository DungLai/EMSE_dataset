If you make a deep copy of the data that is then processed in a different thread it might work.\r\nDo not use `poll_sensors` to access data, but only if you need to update data. Use `v1.sensors['imu_chest_M'].data['aX']` for data access instead.\r\nKnow that the IMU has problems right now, we will try to fix it asap.\r\nSee #121 for reference.\r\n\r\nIn the future, please do not use screen shots to share code, console output, etc. Only use them if there are problems on the graphics side and try to create a minimal code example to recreate the bug.

Communication between BeamNG.tech and BeamNGpy is tied to the frame rate of the simulator, including any IMU measurements. Your maximum reading rate therefore becomes your FPS. Besides this general limitation, IMUs also only update their values once per frame. There is a higher rate IMU system that exists only for the refNode of a vehicle (so it can't be placed at arbitrary points) and would have data available at 2000Hz, but that rate would still be capped by the rate of message exchange.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/893248035/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
