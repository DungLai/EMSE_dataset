I will try to elaborate a bit further below.\r\n\r\nIn the first scenario:\r\n* The physical wheel starts centred with `angle = 0 deg`\r\n* Then lets say the player finishes the scenario with wheel `angle = 100 deg`\r\n\r\nIn the second scenario:\r\n* The physical wheel is on `angle = 100 deg`\r\n* But the in-game player vehicle spawns with the virtual wheel `angle = 0 deg`\r\n* The moment the player interacts with the physical wheel, the virtual wheel angle instantly \"changes\" to match with the physical wheel angle.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering if there is a way I can instruct the Logitech

again, unfortunately this is not possible (not only from BeamNGpy, but also not from the simulation), you need to recenter the wheel yourself.\r\n\r\nA theoretical possible way of recentering the

apply FFB from Python using the following function.
