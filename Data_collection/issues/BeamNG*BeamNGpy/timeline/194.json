This can change over time, if we add the support, I'll post an update here.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to get these values using Lua.\r\nGeneral interaction data between two colliding nodes is propagated to the `lua/vehicles/main.lua:onNodeCollision` function, which then propagates the data to the wheel system (`lua/vehicle/wheels.lua:nodeCollision`) and also the controller system. You could create a vehicle controller in Lua that gets the data in the `nodeCollision` collision function, then process it.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is any useful for you, if you have more questions on how to continue with this, please let me know! And sorry for the late answer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1307074344/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1309421388","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/194#issuecomment-1309421388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/194","id":1309421388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCEke6s5ODC9M","user":{"login":"ASionville","id":57773476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzczNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57773476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville","html_url":"https://github.com/ASionville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T21:50:01Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T21:50:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the explanation !
