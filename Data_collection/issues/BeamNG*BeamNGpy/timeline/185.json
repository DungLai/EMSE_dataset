The `start_scenario` function then hides that start screen and starts the scenario.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't happen every time, then it's probably a bug. Can you confirm that the start screen does not close when running the `start_scenario` function?\r\n\r\nConfiguring the scenario start message title and description is certainly possible. You can try the following code:\r\n```python\r\nscenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'This is the title text', description='This is the description.')\r\nplayer_vehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800')\r\nscenario.add_vehicle(player_vehicle, pos=(-717, 101, 118), rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))\r\nscenario.make(self.beamng)\r\n\r\nself.beamng.load_scenario(scenario)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can start the scenario and hide the screen by running `self.beamng.start_scenario()`. As far as I know, the start screen cannot be configured to be completely disabled from BeamNGpy. Is that a feature that you'd want to have? We could try to add it to our roadmap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1219367993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1220182088","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/185#issuecomment-1220182088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/185","id":1220182088,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCEke6s5IuoBI","user":{"login":"purple-mesh","id":110892114,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpwUUg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110892114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh","html_url":"https://github.com/purple-mesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purple-mesh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-19T02:43:50Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T02:51:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @aivora-beamng,\r\n\r\nThank you for your clarification!

To get the waypoints of a scenario, you can call the function `Scenario.find_waypoints()`.\r\n\r\nWaypoints are nodes of the navgraph - you can think of them as named positions in a map. If you call `find_waypoints`, you'll see that there are tens of waypoints already predefined on most of the maps.\r\n\r\nCheckpoints of a scenario are positions that are needed to be driven through in order to finish a scenario. To create checkpoints in your scenario, you can call the function `Scenario.add_checkpoints` (see the example below).\r\n\r\nIf you run the example, you can see that every checkpoint created through the `add_checkpoints` function has its associated waypoint.\r\n```python\r\nfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle\r\n\r\nbng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256)\r\nbng.open()\r\n\r\nscenario =
