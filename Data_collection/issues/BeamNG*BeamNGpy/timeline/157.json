It seems that it fails to load the util_researchGE extension and with that the game will not respond on the API port 64256. I tried to follow earlier reported (now closed) issues on how to manually set up a workspace, but it does not seem to work for me. Is that the reason why the util_researchGE extension does not work? What am I missing?\r\n\r\nBeamNG.drive console output:\r\n000.623|I|Paths|User path: C:\\Users\\quaid\\AppData\\Local\\BeamNG.drive\\0.24\\\r\n002.941|I|GELua.core_input_bindings.bindings|Controller connected: XBox Controller 1 (xinput0/0xXIDevice)\r\n002.977|I|GELua.print|*************LightRayPostFX 2 set\r\n002.982|I|GELua.print|********PostFXSSAOGeneralEnabled 2 set\r\n003.033|I|reloadLanguages|Switched from '' language to 'en-US' (as fallback, after trying 'sv-SE')\r\n003.382|W|GELua.core_levels.|info.json missing: /levels/GridMap/info.json\r\n003.383|E|GELua.core_levels.|No entry point for level found: /levels/GridMap.
