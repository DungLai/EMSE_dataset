Moreover, there is no possibility to dynamically change the brightness of the lights from BeamNGpy, it can only be done through editing of the corresponding `.jbeam` files.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try to increase brightness/range of the high beam headlights, you can do so with the following steps:\r\n1. Choose a vehicle for which you want to increase headlight intensity (let's say it will be `pickup`).\r\n2. Find the `<vehicle>_headlights.jbeam` file (it's in the game directory, `content/vehicles/pickup.zip/vehicles/pickup/pickup_headlights.jbeam`.\r\n3. Create a new mod with this copied file. That means, copy the `pickup_headlights.jbeam` to the mods folder (`%localappdata%/BeamNG.{drive/tech}/0.25/mods/unpacked/customized_headlights/vehicles/pickup/pickup_headlights.jbeam`). The directory structure will not exist, so you have to create the missing directories.\r\n4. Open the file you copied into the mods directory. Increase the `lightBrightness` parameters to `1.0` for the highbeams. Do not forget to change the `lightBrightness` for both the left (`pickup_headlight_L`) and right (`pickup_headlight_R) headlight. Save the file.\r\n5. When you launch BeamNG, you should see that there is a new mod called `customized_headlights` added. Also every pickup spawned should have a higher intensity of the highbeam headlights.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1260838707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1269585517","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/189#issuecomment-1269585517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/189","id":1269585517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCEke6s5LrFZt","user":{"login":"sainan-zhang","id":53167747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTY3NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53167747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/sainan-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sainan-zhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T08:33:52Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T08:33:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi! Thanks for your detailed reply. I have set the value of \"lightBrightness\" to 1 and created a new vehicle mod according to your suggestion. But the light intensity of the vehicle is still not as strong as the high beam in real life. In the following figure, I copied the blue vehicle, then changed the value of \"lightBrightness\" to 1.0 to get the red vehicle. That is, the difference between red vehicle and blue vehicle is only the \"lightBrightness\" value. Is there any other way to make the vehicles in Beamng achieve the same glare intensity as a real-life high beam? Can you give me some help? Looking forward to your reply.
