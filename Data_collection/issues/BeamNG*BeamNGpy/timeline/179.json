Here is some information, which will hopefully help you with adding custom annotations to maps.  Perhaps you already know some of this, but even then - maybe it will fill in any gaps:\r\n\r\nAnnotations can be applied to materials and meshes (Note that sky and water objects normally have an annotation already assigned, and decals and decalroads do not need annotation).  Assigning annotations to terrain materials can be done by applying it in the materials editor.  From terrain tools, go to the terrain painter tab and open the terrain material library.  Select a terrain material, assign the annotation in the bottom section, and save changes to file.\r\n\r\nThere are four methods we can use to apply annotations, although using the first two are best practice here, so we recommend sticking to those.\r\n\r\n1. You can assign the annotation type directly on the material from the material editor window (under the additional info tab).  This can have a side effect, however, if that material is used for things different from what you planned (eg assigned to a sidewalk mesh which is also used in buildings) â€“ you will need to use another method to assign the annotation in that specific case. Remember to save the material after changing any parameters.\r\n\r\n2. You can assign the annotation type to the selected object through the inspector window.  Select an object in the scene and in the inspector window, go to the ObjectAnnotation tab to select the correct annotation type.  The annotation type will be assigned to the whole object, so be sure that the mesh does not have other elements that belong to a different annotation type.\r\n\r\n3. If necessary, forest objects have their own annotation type application.  You can go to the forest tool panel and choose select item from the top bar.  Select a forest object and press Select ForestItemData from the inspector window.  In the next window you can assign the ObjectAnnotation to the forest object which will be updated on all similar forest objects placed in the map.\r\n\r\n4. It is possible to assign annotation type to Prefabs with the same process as in 2.  You can just select the Prefab, and go into the inspector window to assign the annotation types.  Note that the annotation type will be assigned to all the objects inside the Prefab, however.  We suggest not using this method, since it is best to assign annotation type to the mesh objects.\r\n\r\n![tml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94687751/179505296-ce7a3fe3-f8a2-471c-8890-3663974cb331.png)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBeamNGTech
