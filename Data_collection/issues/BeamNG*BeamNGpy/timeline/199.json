Here, it looks like the far plane of the camera is too short.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, as default values, we have `near_far_planes: Float2 = (0.05, 100.0)`.  You can see this for yourself if you look at the constructor in `camera.py`.  \r\n\r\nHowever, you can increase the far plane (the 2nd number) to something like `1000`.  For example, when you set the camera up, include `near_far_planes=(0.05, 1000.0)` in the argument list of the function call.  \r\n\r\nWe will increase this default value for the next release.  This was most likely a typo during coding.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBeamNG Tech
