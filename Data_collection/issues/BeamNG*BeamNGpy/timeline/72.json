three different versioning types:\r\n1. the internal versioning system depending on the build, which is printed on the console and log\r\n2. the svn versioning, which is the revision number\r\n3. the versioning of the BeamNG.research build, where the latest is 1.7.0.0 which uses revision 47\r\nI think its safe to ignore number 1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/705537900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3855194133,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzODU1MTk0MTMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/3855194133","actor":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-08T12:34:52Z","assignee":{"login":"pascale-commits","id":69152944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTUyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69152944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits","html_url":"https://github.com/pascale-commits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascale-commits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/706272206","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/72#issuecomment-706272206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/72","id":706272206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjI3MjIwNg==","user":{"login":"ASionville","id":57773476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzczNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57773476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville","html_url":"https://github.com/ASionville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ASionville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-09T16:14:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T16:14:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
