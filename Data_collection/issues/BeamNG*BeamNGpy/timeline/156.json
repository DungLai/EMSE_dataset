You can see the way how to do this in the `multi_client.ipynb` example; when you spawn a vehicle through GUI, you will see it in the list of vehicles returned by `client.get_current_vehicles()`.\r\n\r\nA snippet:\r\n1. Create the scenario.\r\n```python\r\nbng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256)\r\nbng.open()\r\n\r\nscenario = Scenario('smallgrid', 'test')\r\nav = Vehicle('vehicle', model='etk800')\r\nscenario.add_vehicle(av, pos=(0, -10, 0))\r\nscenario.make(bng)\r\nbng.load_scenario(scenario)\r\nbng.start_scenario()\r\n```\r\n2. Spawn the vehicle through GUI.\r\n3. Find the spawned vehicle in the list of current vehicles, connect to it and switch to it (this can be done from any client connected).\r\n```python\r\nactive_vehicles = bng.get_current_vehicles()\r\nprint(active_vehicles)\r\n\r\nactive_vehicles['clone'].connect(bng)\r\nbng.switch_vehicle(active_vehicles['clone'])\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1072579514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6290867701,"node_id":"CE_lADOCEke6s5BSWFEzwAAAAF29wX1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/6290867701","actor":{"login":"aivora-beamng","id":93574498,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZPVYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93574498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng","html_url":"https://github.com/aivora-beamng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aivora-beamng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-23T11:27:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
