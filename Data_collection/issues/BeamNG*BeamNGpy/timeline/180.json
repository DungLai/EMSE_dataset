I will try to answer them here:\r\n\r\nThe vehicle position is actually the vehicles 'ref node' snapped to the float grid, which may be slightly different from the position which you said.  The 'ref node' is fairly stable, so if you do not deform the vehicle too much, this will be fixed, and you can take the difference into account if you need to (it should remain the same for all time). Note: even the 'ref node' is not at (0, 0, 0).\r\n\r\nOur jbeam engineers choose four stable vehicle nodes to define the local reference system of the vehicle. These nodes should be well-positioned and guarded so as to avoid being exposed to deformation as much as possible. From these four nodes, we compute vectors such as 'forward' and 'up' - these are useful since they provide a local frame for the vehicle at a given time (you can get the third vector by taking the cross product of these two, for example) and use these to form transformation matrices etc.  The reason the direction is not parallel to the XY plane, as you have noticed, is because these vectors will be slightly out.  It is very close to parallel here - -0.011 is very small, and again this should remain constant, so one can take this into consideration when doing any computations with it, if required.  'dir' here is just the forward direction of this frame ie the direction in which the vehicle is facing forward.\r\n\r\n'wheelspeed' is usually the average speed of all four wheels.\r\n\r\nSteering is linear with the movement within the steering rack, but not necessarily linear with wheel angle (this depends on the suspension geometry, and whether you are looking at the left or right wheel (it will be assymmetric depending on the Ackermann angle setup for the vehicle, eg see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry for some more information on that). \r\n\r\nRegarding the question about the brake value:  are you using the 'arcade' shifting mode? this mode will automatically apply some braking for you when the vehicle is stopped.  Maybe try switching to the 'realistic' shifting mode and review the options->gameplay->assistant settings if you do not want the game to be adding extra helper inputs.\r\n\r\nWe hope the information here will help you somewhat with your queries.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBeamNG Tech Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1179577634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dstark481","id":94687751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaTSBw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94687751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481","html_url":"https://github.com/dstark481","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstark481/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/1179905588","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/180#issuecomment-1179905588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/180","id":1179905588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCEke6s5GU-40","user":{"login":"naner34","id":54585256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTg1MjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54585256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34","html_url":"https://github.com/naner34","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naner34/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-11T02:47:16Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T02:47:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much.
