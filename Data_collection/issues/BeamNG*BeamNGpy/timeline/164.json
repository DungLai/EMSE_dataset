In future versions of the library, we may expose this functionality to be more accessible.\r\n\r\nThis code snippet spawns a Vivace in 110d configuration in the West Coast USA scenario:\r\n```python\r\nfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Vehicle, Scenario\r\nbeamng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256)\r\nbeamng.open()\r\n\r\nscenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'config_spawn')\r\n\r\nvehicle = Vehicle('ego', model='vivace', partConfig='vehicles/vivace/vivace_110d_M.pc')\r\nscenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(-725.365, 92.4684, 118.437),\r\n                     rot_quat=(-0.006, -0.0076, 0.921, -0.389))\r\n\r\nscenario.make(beamng)\r\nbeamng.load_scenario(scenario)\r\nbeamng.start_scenario()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find all the different `.pc` configurations in the BeamNG.tech folder, for example `content/vehicles/vivace.zip/vehicles/vivace/*.pc`. You can also provide a path to your custom part configuration
