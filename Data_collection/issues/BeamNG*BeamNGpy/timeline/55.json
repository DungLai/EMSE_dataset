you using by chance the beamng research version that is linked to the web site? The one that you can access without being registered/enabled? In that case you should know that that version is outdated and more importantly strongly limited. For example, you can use only one car and one model. Additionally that version is not compatible with beamngpy. If you are interested in using the updated/unlimited version of the simulator you need to get access by sending an email to beamng. There might be conditions to get it. For example you must be an active student, use the simulator for research purposes or personal use and the like. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/653152302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alessiogambi","id":1557512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1557512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi","html_url":"https://github.com/alessiogambi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/653493165","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/55#issuecomment-653493165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/55","id":653493165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzQ5MzE2NQ==","user":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-03T11:09:06Z","updated_at":"2020-07-03T11:09:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, as Alessio pointed out, that version is no longer maintained.
