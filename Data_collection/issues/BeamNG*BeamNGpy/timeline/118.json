The `Scenario` class contains a method to download the scenario's scene tree. While I should add better methods to query that tree for specific objects, in the meantime you can traverse it for objects of a certain type -- in your case `BeamNGWaypoint`. It would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscenario.sync_scene()\r\ndef get_waypoints(node, waypoints):\r\n    if node.type == 'BeamNGWaypoint':\r\n        waypoints.add(node)\r\n    if node.children:\r\n        for child in node.children:\r\n            get_waypoints(child, waypoints)\r\n\r\nwaypoints = set()\r\nget_waypoints(scenario.scene, waypoints)\r\n```\r\nThe `sync_scene()` function is a bit slow at this point (this and related features are kind of WIP) but seeing as the waypoints are unlikely to move around, you can get away with synchronizing it once after loading a scenario.

The `sync_scene()` function is indeed a bit slow and takes over a minute to complete on some of the larger maps like `west_coast_usa`. The only other thing I would add to your answer is for anyone looking at this issue in the future, you can then access the waypoint locations and names using:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscenario.sync_scene()\r\nwaypoints = set()\r\nget_waypoints(scenario.scene, waypoints)\r\nfor w in waypoints:\r\n    print(w.name)\r\n    print(w.pos)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand most of these functions are a WIP, but regardless I know there are many researchers out there all over the world that thank you for making your software available :)  So thank you a ton!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/832869879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hildebrandt-carl","id":26097148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDk3MTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26097148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl","html_url":"https://github.com/hildebrandt-carl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4690387504,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY5MDM4NzUwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/4690387504","actor":{"login":"hildebrandt-carl","id":26097148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDk3MTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26097148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl","html_url":"https://github.com/hildebrandt-carl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hildebrandt-carl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-05T17:20:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4690387515,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY5MDM4NzUxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/4690387515","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-05T17:20:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4690387516,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2OTAzODc1MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/4690387516","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-05T17:20:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"ht
