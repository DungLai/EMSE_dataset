To find these, you could call this method with this class name as the parameter. The same goes for other object. In addition, I've added little helper functions to the scenario class for commond types like the waypoint.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/503474475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2423426768,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQyMzQyNjc2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/2423426768","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-19T09:04:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
