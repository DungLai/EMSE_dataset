thanks for reporting but I've had no luck recreating this issue. I've tried to recreate your use-case but no luck. If you want to update BeamNGpy, you'll also need to use a compatible BeamNG.tech version. Maybe it is worth a try, but note that I haven't tried that myself. From the next update on we'll include a list of compatible BeamNG.tech - BeamNGpy versions.\r\nI'll close this issue for now, but feel free to reopen it. At that time please include the python log file (use `setup_logging()`).
