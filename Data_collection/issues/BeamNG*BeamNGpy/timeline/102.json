The below image is taken with `near_far=(10, 100)` :\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2222870/107864426-db913680-6e53-11eb-9fb4-a94f7156e294.png)\r\n\r\nThis raises the question that actually the `near_far` parameter should only address camera clipping, and another parameter should address the minimum and maximum distance thresholds for white and black pixels. In the above image, I would expect the sky to still remain white, and the nearest objects to be completely black (they are currently a mid grey in this example). The white object in the bottom left of this image is actually a result of seeing 'under' the map and viewing a far away downhill slope.\r\n\r\nLike i said, I think camera clipping and white/black thresholds should become two separate parameters. This would allow me to create a sweet spot, where a linear scale of lightness between 0 and 255 represents a range of distances between 10 and 100 (in this example). I don't actually want objects between 0 and 10 distance to be clipped, i just want them to all be black.\r\n\r\nOr maybe camera clipping should just be left out entirely? I don't really see a use for it for depth images, other than to reduce computational load during the decode process. A real stereo camera sensor that produces a depth image is not able to simple clip the camera in such a way, just define a distance range for which lightness values 0-255 are mapped:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2222870/107864617-d9c87280-6e55-11eb-97dd-19c640011a9d.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/778693992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BleedObsidian","id":2222870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2222870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian","html_url":"https://github.com/BleedObsidian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4328243505,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMyODI0MzUwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/4328243505","actor":{"login":"mihalykorodi","id":43953011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTUzMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43953011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi","html_url":"https://github.com/mihalykorodi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-13T23:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4328243506,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMjgyNDM1MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/events/4328243506","actor":{"login":"mihalykorodi","id":43953011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTUzMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43953011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi","html_url":"https://github.com/mihalykorodi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihalykorodi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-13T23:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/778699268","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/102#issuecomment-778699268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/102","id":778699268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODY5OTI2OA==","user":{"login":"BleedObsidian","id":2222870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjI4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2222870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian","html_url":"https://github.com/BleedObsidian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BleedObsidian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url
