You could simply add `n` cameras at `n` different positions/directions. I looked into implementing a camera that has multiple positions/directions itself, but it would mainly clutter up the code to save having to create multiple `Camera` objects instead of just multiple positions/directions. With the codebase as it is right now, it's also kind of a hassle to have a sensor cause multiple polls in a single call. This can be changed, of course, but would require more work and in the meantime simply using multiple `Camera` objects is probably easier. I'm open to other suggestions, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/638180136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Palculator","id":37553150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTUzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37553150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator","html_url":"https://github.com/Palculator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Palculator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/comments/638197350","html_url":"https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/46#issuecomment-638197350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/issues/46","id":638197350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODE5NzM1MA==","user":{"login":"alessiogambi","id":1557512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1557512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi","html_url":"https://github.com/alessiogambi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessiogambi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T13:29:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T13:30:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, if the properties of the camera can be changed dynamically, one can attach a single camera sensor, pause the simulation, collect all the required images, and resume the execution.
