The following are the immediate issues:\r\n\r\n- there is too much SqlAlchemy specific code. I will be adding a mongodb backend (#58) so I can identify shared patterns\r\n-the airflow code is brittle and requires a local airflow instance. I have the skeleton of a remote airflow worker, so i'm going to setup an airflow instance in the cloud to test. I am also going to add support for luigi (#57) to identify shared patterns as above\r\n- the authentication code is too SqlAlchemy specific. I'm going to add support for authenticating through the airflow instance, and via something like oauth\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, I think it makes sense to identify what this product should look like, and to just generally go through some UX flow mockups.\r\n\r\nCC @blink1073 @eriknw ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/timkpaine/paperboy/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/timkpaine/paperboy/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
