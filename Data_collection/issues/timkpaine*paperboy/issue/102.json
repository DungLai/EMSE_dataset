Maybe I'm stupid and I just don't know how to access airflow but it's not really explained in 'CONTRIBUTING' how you switched from paperboy to Airflow. You're are mentionning a folder named airflow but I searched and couldn't find any.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate if you try to keep this project alive as it would be trully useful for me :)\r\n\r\nHow to replicate : Follow the 'CONTRIBUTING'\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/timkpaine/paperboy/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/timkpaine/paperboy/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
