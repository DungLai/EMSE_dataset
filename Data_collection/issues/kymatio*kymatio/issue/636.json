I have a question about how to inverse wavelet tranform to a original signal. Does it like you show in [https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/examples/1d/reconstruct_torch.py](url)? \r\n\r\nI viewed the code and find you inverse it by training the scatting. Is there a exist function (like iSTFT for STFT) for inverse wavelet process?
