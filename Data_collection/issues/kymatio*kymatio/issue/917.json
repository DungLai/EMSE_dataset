Many thanks to @cyrusvahidi for finding it and bringing it up.\r\n\r\nHere's the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n| ⬇️ `average` / `T` ➡️ | `None`             | `0` (int)      | `>=1`  (int or float)                 | \r\n|-------|------------------|---------|----------------------|\r\n| `None`  | avg. with `T=2**J` | no avg. | avg. with user-set `T` | \r\n| `True`  | avg. with `T=2**J` (`DeprecationWarning`)| `ValueError`  | avg. with user-set `T` (`DeprecationWarning`) | \r\n| `False` | no avg. (`DeprecationWarning`)         | `ValueError` | `ValueError`                | \r\n\r\n* The new default will be `average=None`, `T=None`, and will be backwards compatible with the old default, without warning nor error.\r\n* Passing `T=0` and letting `average=None` will be the new way to specify `average=False`.\r\n* Already-in-place settings `average=False` and `T>=1` will keep working as intended. The former will raise a `DeprecationWarning`, instructing the user to replace `average=False` by `T=0` before v0.4.\r\n* Passing `average=True` together with `T>=1` or `T=None` will raise a `DeprecationWarning`, instructing the user to remove the `average` argument befor v0.4.\r\n* Passing `T=0` together with setting `average=False` will raise a `ValueError`, because this is redundant. The `ValueError` will instruct the user to remove the `average` argument immediately.\r\n* If both parameters are set (to non-None values), neither of the two parameters will override the other. `T=0, average=True` will error, and same for `T>=1, average=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurns out, we have forgotten one important element: switch to the `average=None` by default! This causes `DeprecationWarning` in current user code even when they don't pass average. Worse, passing `T=0` does not work because it clashes with the implicit `average=True`.\r\n\r\nWorking on a fix right now. I will need to be backported to v0.3 (summoning the help of @janden / @eickenberg !)","closed_by":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
