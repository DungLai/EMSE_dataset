It's a bit long, but I think that it's fine. It's not a name one would type repeatedly in code, and autocompletion solves that problem in part too.","closed_by":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
