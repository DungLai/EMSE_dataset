doing JTFS with `format=\"joint\"` it seems that there is an off-by-one index in `meta['order']`\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom kymatio.torch import TimeFrequencyScattering\r\n\r\njtfs_kwargs = {'shape': 2**15, 'Q': (12, 1), 'J': 8, 'J_fr': 6, 'T': 2**6, \"F\": 1}\r\njtfs = TimeFrequencyScattering(**jtfs_kwargs)\r\nSx = jtfs(torch.zeros(2**15))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code produces an out size of `torch.Size([98, 64, 512])`, while there is a `98` in `.meta()['order']`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor 3D aligned format, we skip order 0, for obvious reasons: https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/3f7d02518f111e7c127da8d97e65de5f1a492a81/kymatio/scattering1d/frontend/base_frontend.py#L643 \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems we forgot to omit order 0 from meta in the case that `format==\"joint\" and out_type==\"array\"`: https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/3f7d02518f111e7c127da8d97e65de5f1a492a81/kymatio/scattering1d/frontend/base_frontend.py#L668\r\n\r\nA simple condition to check the format and out_type fixes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n if len(path['n']) == 0:\r\n        # If format='joint' and out_type='array' skip zeroth order\r\n        if not (self.format == 'joint' and self.out_type == 'array'):\r\n            # add order0 meta \r\n            ...\r\n```
