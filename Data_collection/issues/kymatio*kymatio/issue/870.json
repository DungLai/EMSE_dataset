Of course, the code in these frontends look very similar: they do argument check, input check, input reshape, scattering, and output reshape.\r\n\r\nWe have a `self.backend` object, so there is no reason why we couldn't perform all these operations in `base_frontend.py`, with appropriate `shape`, `reshape_input`, and `reshape_output` routines being methods of `self.backend`.\r\n\r\nThis would help us maintain the code because there would be a single point of entry for the `if out_type=\"array\"` clause and its friends. And i believe it is compliant with #735 philosophy, since it decouples shape pre/post-processing from core scattering.\r\n\r\nI have written a short PR where i do this in 1D, to showcase the idea. I surmise that the same would be possible in 2D and 3D.","closed_by":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/870/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/870/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
