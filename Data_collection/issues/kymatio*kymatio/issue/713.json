How can I get the central frequencies of the wavelets being computed in Hertz ? I have 202 signals, each signal length is 78120, sampling rate (Fs) is 7812 samples per second. I set the parameters of the Scattring1D like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nT = 2**16 # closest power of 2 product\r\nJ = 12 \r\nQ = 8\r\n\r\ninput_mat = input_mat[:,:T]\r\nscat_obj = Scattering1D(J, T, Q)\r\noutput_mat = scat_obj(input_mat)\r\n```\r\nI got output mat in shape of 202,546,16 Now I want to figure out what is the frequencies in Hz of the 546 wavelets in the filter banks that were being used for the scattering coefficients computation I got for each signal.\r\n\r\n```\r\nI tried to use\r\nmeta = scat_obj.meta()\r\ncentral_freqs = meta['xi']\r\n```\r\nBut 'xi' is a vector of shape (546,2) and its values are between 0 to 1 and I want to get them in Hz using my sampling rate.\r\n\r\nThank U !","closed_by":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
