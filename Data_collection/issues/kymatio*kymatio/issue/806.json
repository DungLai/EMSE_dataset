Furthermore, I believe a large majority of the research utilizing Kymatio largely uses the Torch back/frontend of our software. \r\n\r\nI highly reccomend reconsidering making Numpy the default back/frontend. This role should instead be relegated to a proper deep learning library, such as Pytorch (which is the current default). \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
