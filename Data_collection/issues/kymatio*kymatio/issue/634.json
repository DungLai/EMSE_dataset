The final idea is to classify 1D signals.\r\n\r\nI followed the example available at the link\r\n\r\nhttps://www.kymat.io/gallery_1d/plot_classif_torch.html#sphx-glr-gallery-1d-plot-classif-torch-py\r\n\r\nBased on this example, I imported three .mat files that contain the compiled data from the COOLL dataset (https://coolldataset.github.io/). Two variables were imported:\r\n\r\nx2 contains the values ​​of the appliance currents. x2 is a matrix with 840 lines and 4 * 8192 columns. y2 contains the Label list. It has 840 positions, one for each appliance.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to calculate the coefficients of the Scattering1D transform for each of the signals that x2 contains. For this, I am doing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nT=32768;\r\nJ=8;\r\nQ=12;\r\nif use_cuda:\r\n    scattering.cuda()\r\n    \r\n    x2 = x2.cuda()\r\n    y2 = y2.cuda()\r\n\r\nSx_all = scattering.forward(x2)\r\n```\r\nWhen I do this, the following error appears:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-62-26c538d90a70> in <module>()\r\n      1 #Sx_all = scattering(x2)\r\n----> 2 Sx_all = scattering.forward(x2)\r\n\r\n1 frames\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/kymatio/backend/torch_backend.py in input_checks(x)\r\n      9 \r\n     10     if not x.is_contiguous():\r\n---> 11         raise RuntimeError('The input must be contiguous.')\r\n     12 \r\n     13 def _is_complex(x):\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: The input must be contiguous.\r\n```\r\nThis error does not appear when I run the original program, from the example available at https://www.kymat.io/gallery_1d/plot_classif_torch.html#sphx-glr-gallery-1d-plot-classif-torch-py.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does the error message 'The input must be contiguous' mean, and how do you suggest I fix the problem? I tried to read the library documentation but I still haven't solved the problem.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.","closed_by":{"login":"evertoneie","id":58944849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTQ0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58944849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie","html_url":"https://github.com/evertoneie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
