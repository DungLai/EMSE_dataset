(edited by EO):\r\n\r\n- [x] method `.to()` for 1D\r\n- [x] method `.to()` for 2D\r\n- [x] method `.to()` for 3D\r\n\r\nPyTorch tensors have a `to` function (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.to), which combines datatype conversion and device copy (i.e., `cpu()` and `cuda()` functions). It might be good to have something similar on our end. This would, for example, simplify device-agnostic code that could simply call\r\n```\r\nscattering.to(x.device)\r\nSx = scattering(x)\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nif x.is_cuda:\r\n    scattering.cuda()\r\nelse:\r\n    scattering.cpu()\r\nSx = scattering(x)\r\n```\r\nIt would also simplify our test suite which is full of such if statements.\r\n\r\nA (slightly) related question is how to handle multiple GPUs. Right now, we're restricted to the current GPU as defined by PyTorch.\r\n\r\nFinally, all of this needs to be considered with our goal of backend agnosticism in mind. We don't want to commit to hard to the PyTorch infrastructure. Still, I think there could be a way to do this in an appropriate manner.","closed_by":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/351/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
