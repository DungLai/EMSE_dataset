My plan for this is to add these two lines of code to `Scattering1D.build` in the base frontend:\r\n```python\r\nphi_f = gauss_1d(self.N, self.sigma0/self.T)\r\nmin_to_pad = 3 * compute_temporal_support(phi_f.reshape(1, -1), criterion_amplitude)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Net reduction in LOC count\r\n* Simplification of the `scattering1d/filter_bank` module\r\n* Faster `Scattering1D` constructor\r\n* no more `criterion_amplitude` being passed to `scattering_filter_factory`\r\n* no more `compute_minimum_support_to_pad`\r\n* Backwards compatible as far as frontends are concerned","closed_by":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
