For example, what does the input size correspond to (e.g., in audio, 65536 at 44.1 kHz is about 1.5 seconds, so 64 of them is about 90 seconds of audio). We should also specify what values for `J`, `Q`, etc. that are used. In the end, we want users to understand these numbers not only in how they compare to previous implementations, but also more generally.\r\n\r\nA separate (parallel) idea is to provide numbers for some standard database.
