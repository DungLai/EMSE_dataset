order of the scattering transform is integer in 1d (`max_order=2`), boolean in 2d (`order2=True`), decided at forward runtime in 3d (`order_2=True`).\r\nI would propose to unify this and make it integer, so that third-order scattering could, in principle, be implemented in the future.\r\nI don't love the name `max_order`. The `max` prefix makes it sound like it's signal-adaptive, whereas it's a static choice.\r\nI suggest `n_orders=2`.\r\nIf we want to have different outputs at runtime, we can always have kwarg `orders=[1,2]` in `forward`, but that's another story.","closed_by":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
