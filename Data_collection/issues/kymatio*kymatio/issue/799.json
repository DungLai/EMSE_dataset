Arguably the worst configuration of all. We should either default to both `True` or both `False`.\r\n\r\nSince there's still some confusion, another attempt at explaining: `aligned=True` is an oversampled `aligned=False`. Filterbank parameters are independent of `aligned`, so in this sense the \"paths\" are unaffected.\r\n\r\n - 1D convs: all configs are valid. We pack `n2, n1_fr, n1` along channels, where they \"don't talk\" (every learned convolution filter sees only one path)\r\n - 2D convs: all `out_3D=True` configs are valid\r\n - 3D convs: all `out_3D=True` configs are valid if `n2` is packed along channels (so convolve over `(n1_fr, n1, t)` with spins split), since `out_3D=True` always enforces `aligned=True` on per-`n2` basis\r\n - 4D convs: no configs are valid. Only here is `aligned=False` a dealbreaker.\r\n - \"all configs\" assumes `'resample'`, since `'recalibrate'` breaks actual path alignment.\r\n\r\n#791 makes `average_fr=True` a close equivalent to `average_fr=False` on averting loss of information due to averaging up to a certain `F`, but that's for later.\r\n\r\n@lostanlen @janden","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
