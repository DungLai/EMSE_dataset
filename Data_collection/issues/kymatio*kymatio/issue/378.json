everyone,\r\n\r\n`meta()` is actually only returning center frequencies and bandwiths of psiN_fs. \r\nShould it also contain information about phi_f ? \r\n\r\nI think it could be useful since users will only need to call `meta()` to get all the frequency-related information.\r\n\r\nIt will be a minor modification by just adding `phi_f[\"xi\"]` and `phi_f[\"sigma\"]`  ( or `0.0` and `2^-J` ) in the first rows of `meta[\"xi\"]` and `meta[\"sigma\"]`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
