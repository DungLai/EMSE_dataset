I saw the \"plot_invert_scattering.py\" but I am not sure If I am doing it correctly for the scattering1D.\r\n\r\nthank you","closed_by":{"login":"blibliki","id":33557742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU3NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33557742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki","html_url":"https://github.com/blibliki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
