Sometimes we know where most energy will be and discard coefficients as a post-processing step. If they happen to be high-freq coeffs, however, they eat up majority of compute - and it'd be much more effective to not compute them at all. This shouldn't be hard to implement - worst part will be adjusting meta & tests.\r\n\r\n 2. Decimating grants speed & memory without changing the scale of invariance. Often, the final output barely differs from undecimated. For this we can introduce `Td` (`T` decimate) and `Fd`. A problem is introducing negatives at output - but this can be easily compensated for with an offset.\r\n\r\nI use both these with success.
