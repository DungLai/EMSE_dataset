now, there are several arguments to the `Scattering1D` class that are not used: `criterion_amplitude`, `r_psi`, `sigma0`, `alpha`, `P_max`, `eps`. Another argument, `normalize`, is used in one of the tests, but set to its default value (`'l1'`). While it is good to have flexibility, there is currently no evidence that the defaults give unsatisfactory results. Furthermore, having these options make it harder to follow what's going on and increases the burden for us in maintaining backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis last point is important because there is likely some reduction and refactoring possible here. For example, `criterion_amplitude` and `eps` both refer to a precision in computing the filter bank, while `P_max` refers to the number of periods to use in computing a filter. These could probably be computed from a single tolerance value. Further, `alpha` is the \"aliasing tolerance after subsampling\" and may be calculated from the `oversampling` parameter (or vice versa). The other parameters, `r_psi`, `sigma0`, and `normalize`, are more independent, but the question remains how to specify them in a way that's simple and compatible with the other transforms.\r\n\r\nUntil we have decided how to structure these interfaces, I think it's a good idea to fix these parameters to their default values and bring them back into the interface when it's time.","closed_by":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/227/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
