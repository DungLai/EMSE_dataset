Looks like when I run this without CUDA enabled, it crashes when trying to determine the type of the input tensor. It might be my personal config, but I should mention that `torch.cuda.is_available()` works without crashing.\r\n\r\nMore bigger picture, do we want to modify this implementation to more closely align with the 1D/2D calling sequence? May make things easier for users (and also prevent the above type of errors).","closed_by":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
