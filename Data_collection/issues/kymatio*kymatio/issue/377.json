was trying to compare 1D filter constructor in scatnet with kymatio, and I couldn't make a one-to-one correspondence between the two. Here are a handful of items that I'm confused about:\r\nAs an example, I tried to regenerate the following scatnet filter in kymatio:\r\n```\r\nfilter_size = 16\r\noption.boundary = 'per';\r\noption.J = 3;\r\noption.P = 0;\r\nfilter = morlet_filter_bank_1d(filter_size, option);\r\n```\r\nthe equivalent function in kymatio would be\r\n```\r\nscattering_filter_factory(J_support, J_scattering, Q, r_psi=math.sqrt(0.5),\r\n                              criterion_amplitude=1e-3, normalize='l1',\r\n                              to_torch=False, max_subsampling=None,\r\n                              sigma0=0.1, alpha=5., P_max=5, eps=1e-7)\r\n```\r\nI understand that $filter_size = 2^{J_support}$, so it should be 4, then the default value for Q in scatnet is 1. However, I noticed that the default value for sigma0 is $2/\\sqrt(3)$ in scatnet while it is $0.1$ is kymatio. I also think J_scattering should be 3. \r\n\r\nNow with my assumptions (but I left sigma0=0.1 for now), I check the outputs of these two functions: for scatnet's morlet_filter_bank_1d I have:\r\n\r\nfilter.phi.filter:    coefft: {[16×1 double]  [8×1 double]  [4×1 double]  [2×1 double]}\r\nfilter.psi.filter:  cell array :  {1×1 struct}    {1×1 struct}    {1×1 struct} , where each struct has same form as filter.phi.filter.\r\n\r\nlet's write down first vector in phi:\r\n[-0.0000,    0.0715,    0.2331,    0.5101,    0.8683,    1.1880,    1.3186,    1.1903,    0.8745,    0.5228,    0.2539,    0.0985,    0.0263,   -0.0041,   -0.0180,   -0.0206]\r\n\r\nfor kymatio's scattering_filter_factory, I get \r\nphi  :      {[16×1 double]  [8×1 double]}\r\npsi1 :      {[16×1 double]  [16×1 double]  [16×1 double]  [16×1 double]}\r\npsi2 :      {[16×1 double]  [16×1 double]  [16×1 double]  [16×1 double]}\r\n\r\nagain, I check the first element in phi:\r\n[1.00000000e+000 3.72665317e-006 1.92874985e-022 1.38634329e-049\r\n 1.38389653e-087 1.91855567e-136 3.69388307e-196 9.87710872e-267\r\n 0.00000000e+000 9.87710872e-267 3.69388307e-196 1.91855567e-136\r\n 1.38389653e-087 1.38634329e-049 1.92874985e-022 3.72665317e-006]\r\n\r\nwhich is essentially a zero vector. So how can I regenerate a filter similar to the one defined in scatnet on top using kymatio. Lastly, why 1D low pass filters in kymatio have 2 orders? Sorry for lengthy question and thanks!
