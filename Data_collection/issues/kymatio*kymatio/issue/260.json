Currently the pattern is that everything starting in `plot_` is executed, everything else is just displayed as code\r\n- It is possible to override all `conf.py` configs in the command line args to the sphinx build script.\r\n- We should use this to create 3 tiers of doc building: `full`, in which even the slowest examples are built, `fast`, which should be default and include reasonably timed scripts + I think there already exists an option to turn the gallery off altogether, if one so desired. All these options should go in the make file, e.g. as `make html-full` etc","closed_by":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
