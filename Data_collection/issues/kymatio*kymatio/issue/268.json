How is the output organized in memory\r\n     - we can interleave order 1 and 2\r\n     - we can not interleave order 1 and 2\r\n           (a) we can have J1 move with bigger strides (have it more on the left, more intuitive ordering)\r\n           (b) we can have J2 move with bigger strides (J2 determines output size, better grouping)\r\n\r\n2. How is the output presented to the user\r\n    - raw arrays\r\n    - dictionaries indexing relevant subarrays with tuples as keys (this makes dictionary indexing look like array indexing)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are probably others.
