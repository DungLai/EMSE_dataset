bug found by running `pyflakes` on the Kymatio source.\r\nOriginating in code by @edouardoyallon  and @gabrielhuang\r\n\r\nIt happens in a `try` statement which is itself part of an `except` statement, so the bug is really hard to trigger, but it's there.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/56a846f059ba5e185a7378e4a057f11bea25552a/kymatio/scattering2d/filter_bank.py#L119\r\n`filer_file` should read as `filter_file`\r\n\r\nI think that, long term, this caching mechanic would be more elegantly (and more stably) implemented with `joblib.Memory`, and that the calls to `print` could be replaced by `logging`.\r\n\r\nOne example of joblib-based cache manager which comes very close to what we need here is available in `librosa`, cf.
