It leads on my side to ModuleNotFoundErrors when trying to run for instance examples/2d/cifar.py after installing kymatio by python setup.py install (or similarly pip install . in the kymatio head folder). It seems to be linked to the find_packages function of setuptools: \"find_packages() walks the target directory, filtering by inclusion patterns, and finds Python packages (any directory). Packages are only recognized if they include an __init__.py file.\" ([https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#using-find-packages](url)).\r\n\r\nAdding empty __init__.py in those packages solved the problem for me.","closed_by":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
