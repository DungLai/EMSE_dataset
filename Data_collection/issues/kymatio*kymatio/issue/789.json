It is, however, overly conservative, according to `criterion_amplitude=1e-3`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom kymatio.scattering1d.filter_bank import gauss_1d, compute_temporal_support\r\nT = 128\r\nphi = gauss_1d(16384, 0.1 / T)\r\nf_at_subsampling = len(phi)//2//T\r\nf_halfsupport = compute_temporal_support(ifft(phi), criterion_amplitude=1e-3)\r\nprint(f_halfsupport, f_at_subsampling)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n49 64\r\n```\r\nvs `0.13 / T`:\r\n```\r\n63 64\r\n```\r\n`criterion_amplitude` conditions the extent of decay upon which boundary effects, i.e. tail contributions, are negligible. Hence, if contributions past `1e-3` are deemed negligible, then we have ~lossless subsampling - and `0.1` obtaining `49` means we subsample much less (by 30%) than we safely could.\r\n\r\nIt's a simple yet significant change by which the wavelets would also be affected (since `J` is also defined per `sigma0`) and will require changing some tests and maybe docs, so I leave the idea here for now.","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
