lived to see the day.\r\n  \r\nAll work from purely my end is finished; remainder is to be handled by maintainers. Below I have detailed a TODO and recommended a merge order - here is [JTFS report](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/discussions/784). I may add to the PR on occasion, but all optional (examples, utilities, etc) - the implementation is complete. The additions will be on my own branch which will include [preallocation](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/758) as I need the speed.\r\n\r\n@lostanlen @janden @eickenberg @edouardoyallon \r\n  \r\n<hr>\r\n  \r\n### TODO\r\n\r\nIn no particular order\r\n\r\n - [ ] 1.
