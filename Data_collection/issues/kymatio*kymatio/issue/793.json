That is, make each test file like `test_jtfs.py` at bottom.\r\n\r\nCurrently one must run them via a unit test suite like pytest, via a Python terminal. Even if one manages to run it via `pytest.main`, it'll still run the entire test, then print a grand report for us to look through.\r\n\r\nThere's a much better way. Execution can be stopped as soon as there's an exception, and we can jump directly to the offending line at any point of the stack trace with a click, by using an IDE. That's just one benefit - I created the [Spyder tutorial](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/discussions/782) for this reason. Much work goes into making IDEs that give power to and save time for developers.\r\n\r\nPut directly, the current approach is a waste of time, and I'm not eager to do testing moving forward. Yes, it makes the testing code look a bit uglier, but if I didn't do it, I'd _still_ be working on JTFS.\r\n\r\n@janden @eickenberg \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
