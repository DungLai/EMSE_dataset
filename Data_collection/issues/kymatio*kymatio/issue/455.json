This is very subtle behavior and can lead to bugs in the future (if, for example, we want to extract the wavelet modulus coefficients and unpad those).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/455/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
