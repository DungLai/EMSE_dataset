If they're already Issues then I don't put them here. These can wait until after JTFS is merged or mostly reviewed to avoid increasing workload. First two:\r\n\r\n### ~~1. False docs: `J`~~ done\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe maximum log-scale of the scattering transform. In other words,\r\nthe maximum scale is given by :math:`2^J`\r\n```\r\n`J` and `j` are not scale. They are maximum permitted subsampling, which is related to scale, but can be very different from. \r\n\r\nScale is a function of `J`, `Q`, `r_psi`, and `xi` (for `xi` near 0), and indirectly of `sigma0` and `criterion_amplitude`. Namely, the \"direct\" params determine [`'width'`](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/766), and `'width'` is defined in terms of `phi`, which is built via the \"indirect\". I recommend \r\n\r\n```\r\nControls the maximum log-scale and number of octaves of the scattering transform. There \r\nare approx. `Q` wavelets per octave, and bandwidth halves with each octave. Hence, largest \r\nscale wavelet is about `2**J` larger than smallest scale wavelet.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. `'scale'` meta\r\n\r\nPer 1, it'd be neat to have a `'scale'` meta and color the filter plots in terms of those instead of `'j'`, as information on `'j'` is already conveyed by black vertical bars marking dyadic scales. \r\n\r\nIt'd be computed by centering `psi_f` at dc in Fourier then applying `compute_temporal_support` logic on it, i.e. finding first point to drop below `psi_f.max() * criterion_amplitude`, converted to scale via `log2(len(psi_f) // 2 // result)` (this is by how much we can subsample, and directly computes `T` and `log2_T` for `phi_f` - rather, that's how they're defined to begin with).\r\n\r\n### ~~3. Extend docs: `J`~~ done\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nGreater `J` extends time-warp stability to lower frequencies, and other desired properties,\r\nas greater portion of the transform is CQT (fixed `xi` to `sigma` ratio and both exponentially\r\nspaced, as opposed to fixed `sigma` and linearly spaced `xi`).\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
