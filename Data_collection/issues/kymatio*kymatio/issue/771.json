Options:\r\n\r\n 1. `concatenate` & `stack` backend methods\r\n 2. Single backend method that takes `stack` as boolean kwarg\r\n\r\nTwo ways to implement latter; A) use `stack` and `concatenate` directly; B) emulate `stack` via dim-expand + concatenate:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef concatenate(cls, arrays, axis=1, stack=False):\r\n    if stack:\r\n        # emulate `np.stack`\r\n        if axis < 0:\r\n            slc = (slice(None),) * (arrays[0].ndim + axis + 1) + (None,)\r\n        else:\r\n            slc = (slice(None),) * axis + (None,)\r\n        arrays = [a[slc] for a in arrays]\r\n    return cls._np.concatenate(arrays, axis=axis)\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. Do the dim expanding before passing into `backend.concatenate`, but that's unclean\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
