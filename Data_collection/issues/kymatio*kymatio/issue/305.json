This will require overlap-add in the time axis.\r\n\r\nSo the general setup might be something where you specify the axes that you want to have overlap-add in, and it could be a `WaveletTransform` or `OverlapAddConvolution` module that takes care of it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
