useful is it to have this keyword argument [pre_pad] though? using the `Pad` class to do anything else than padding seems like a weird design antipattern. If there is really a use case for doing the conversion, consider making a dedicated method. Otherwise, consider removing the functionality.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @lostanlen in https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/459_\r\n\r\nPadding and moving to complex are very different things. However, both involve significant memory movement (if we're working with large arrays), so a case can be made for combining them. Yet another approach would be to avoid casting to complex in the first place. Indeed, this simply concatenates zeros and slows down further computation (since we're just multiplying by zero there), which may be avoided with a little extra work.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/462/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
