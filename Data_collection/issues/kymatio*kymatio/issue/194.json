follow-up on a discussion with @janden  and @eickenberg  in #158 \r\nAt the moment, the order of positional arguments in the scattering constructors are:\r\nScattering1d: `T, J, Q`\r\nScattering2d: `M, N, J`\r\nScattering 3d: `M, N, O, J, L, sigma_0`\r\n\r\nThe only parameter that is truly common to each of these classes is `J`. It is also the only one in which we really can't provide a good default value. Lastly, we could make the case that the parameters which are relative to input shape (`T`, `M`, `N`, `O`) could be inferred directly from `J` by default. This would pave the way for allowing variable-sized inputs at runtime.\r\n\r\nThat's clearly a lot of work, and I don't want to schedule all that at once. We can work towards this progressively. However, one necessary change to the API is the order of positional parameters. I would recommend\r\n\r\nScattering1d: `J, T, Q`\r\nScattering2d: `J, M, N`\r\nScattering 3d: `J, M, N, O, L, sigma_0`\r\n\r\nThat way, in the future we will be able to progressively include simpler constructors in a backwards compatible way, and/or with appropriate deprecation warnings.\r\nThis is a big API decision but it is not a lot of work on the part of the code. There are only a few places in the docs and examples in which these constructors are called with positional parameters.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
