brought up by reviewer @MuawizChaudhary during CR of #862 \r\nhttps://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/862#discussion_r895089212\r\n\r\nIn 1D, the `scattering` method ends on a rather strange note:\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nelif out_type == 'list':\r\n    for x in out_S:\r\n        x.pop('n')\r\nreturn out_S\r\n```\r\n\r\nin other words, we're going out of our way to conceal the `n` field to the `out_type=\"list\"` user.\r\nPersonally, i don't see a justification for not exposing `n`. It is quite easy to understand and re-use: it can be seen as a \"pointer\" (or tuple of pointers) to the filterbank `psi1_f` (or tuple of filterbanks `(psi1_f, psi2_f)`)\r\nAnd `n` is already exposed to the user anyway, under the form of `S.keys()` with `out_type=\"dict\"` (#861). So i don't think we're running into a big risk of introducing a new functionality that will be difficult to maintain in the future.\r\n\r\nHence i propose to experiment with removing this `x.pop('n')` statement. And if the tests pass, make it part of `v0.3`. There's nothing in it that couldn't be achieved with `out_dict=\"dict\"` and functional programming / some advanced looping mechanisms (like `for k,v in S.items()`, but not all our users are familiar with those Pythonic idioms, so giving them access to `n` as the value of a simple data type (dict) contained in a list is a good way to let them write custom code that inspects `psi` metadata n relation with `S` activations.\r\n\r\nThis change would remove code in 1D and add very little code in 2D/3D.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
