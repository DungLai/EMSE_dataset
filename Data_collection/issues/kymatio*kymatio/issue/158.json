implementation has very different expectations of its inputs and outputs:\r\n- 1D: Expects inputs of size `(B, 1, T)`, outputs `(B, P, T/2**J)`, where `P` is the number of scattering coefficients. Note that if the second dimension of the input is not `1`, it errors.\r\n- 2D: Expects inputs of size `(B, C, M, N)`, outputs `(B, C, P, M/2**J, N/2**J)`. Note that the number of dimensions changes here between input and output (this may be desirable but is not consistent with 1D). Also, from what I understand, the second dimension here is essentially treated as a batch dimension.\r\n- 3D: Expects inputs of size `(B, M, N, O)`, outputs a _tuple_ with elements of size `(B, ?, ?, ?)`. Not sure what's going on here.\r\n\r\nWe should think about harmonizing these to some extent.","closed_by":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
