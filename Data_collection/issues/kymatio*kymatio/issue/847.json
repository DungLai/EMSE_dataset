It says it returns dictionaries where in fact it returns list.\r\n\r\nIt just came to my attention that we don't need dictionaries at all in this part of the code, and can make everything flow with 18 lines of code\r\n\r\n```python\r\nxi_max = compute_xi_max(Q)\r\nsigma_max = compute_sigma_psi(xi_max, Q, r=r_psi)\r\n\r\nif sigma_max <= sigma_min:\r\n    xis = []\r\n    sigmas = []\r\n    elbow_xi = sigma_max\r\nelse:\r\n    xis =  [xi_max]\r\n    sigmas = [sigma_max]\r\n\r\n    # High-frequency (constant-Q) region: geometric progression of xi\r\n    while sigmas[-1] > (sigma_min * math.pow(2, 1/Q)):\r\n        xis.append(xis[-1] / math.pow(2, 1/Q))\r\n        sigmas.append(sigmas[-1] / math.pow(2, 1/Q))\r\n    elbow_xi = xis[-1]\r\n\r\n# Low-frequency (constant-bandwidth) region: arithmetic progression of xi\r\nfor q in range(1, Q):\r\n    xis.append(elbow_xi - q/Q * elbow_xi)\r\n    sigmas.append(sigma_min)\r\n\r\njs = list(map(get_max_dyadic_subsampling, xis, sigmas, repeat(alpha)))\r\nreturn xis, sigmas, js\r\n```\r\n    \r\ninstead of the 30 lines that we currently have. We can also remove the private function `_move_one_dyadic_step`, so this issue aligns with the overarching goal of simplifying `filter_bank.py`: #227, #513, #825, #833 ...    \r\n   ","closed_by":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/847/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
