This conveniently tranposes the time and frequency axes such that we can perform scattering along the frequency axis. However, Kymatio has implemented contiguity checks (for reasons that I am unaware of) that are checked when performing complex modulus and other operators.\r\n\r\nJTFS torch currently hits a runtime error due to non-contiguous tensors that appear to be induced by swap_time_frequency before frequential scattering.\r\n\r\nI opened PR https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/972 which simply forced the tensor returned by swap_time_frequency to be contiguous. This may be inefficient, since it clones the tensor.\r\n\r\nThis poses the following questions:\r\n\r\n- why did we need contiguous tensors in the first place?\r\n- can we copy the tensor and force contiguity?\r\n- is there a more efficient approach?","closed_by":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/974/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/974/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
