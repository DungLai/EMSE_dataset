This would allow power users to define a breadth first search algorithm #798 , or define their own scattering implementation where they can retrieve coefficients #445 (tho, these futures should be one day in our code base, please see #735).\r\n\r\n \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
