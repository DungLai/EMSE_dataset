Question is how much speed you gain, since you are working on optimizing something that from the start only takes 1/6 of the time of an epoch. If you speed up by a factor 2, then you end up at 11/12 of the original time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/643806889/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/655157541","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/615#issuecomment-655157541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/615","id":655157541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTE1NzU0MQ==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T21:57:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T21:57:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"So I believe this is solved!
