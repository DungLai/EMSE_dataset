and numpy (cpu) - it is straightforward to modify the initial script to add more frontends\r\n\r\nNote that the batch used when compute the GPU is multiplied by a factor 8: it implies that while benchmarking the torch scat 2D, one uses the exact same hyper param as a batch on iamgenet (can be useful)\r\n\r\n> Fixes #653\r\n> So far, only relies on bare-bones dependencies (numpy/scipy)\r\n>
