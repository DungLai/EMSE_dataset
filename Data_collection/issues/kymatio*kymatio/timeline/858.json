The first instance is rather an example of the documentation not being created on a machine with GPU. The scattering disk example has looked like that since it was integrated into the library. \r\n\r\n#801 is not an appropriate instance of an example failing. I'm 90% sure the guy was using a branch of kymatio created by OLGD.

These features should be working. \r\n\r\nI do agree that there could be some pruning. There are [three](https://www.kymat.io/gallery_2d/cifar_torch.html#sphx-glr-gallery-2d-cifar-torch-py) different [examples](https://www.kymat.io/gallery_2d/cifar_resnet_torch.html#sphx-glr-gallery-2d-cifar-resnet-torch-py) all on [cifar](https://www.kymat.io/gallery_2d/cifar_small_sample.html#sphx-glr-gallery-2d-cifar-small-sample-py). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I don't think we should be too aggressive with the pruning. Our examples is a point of entry for people to figure out the usage of Kymatio. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think we should have more varied, original, examples.
