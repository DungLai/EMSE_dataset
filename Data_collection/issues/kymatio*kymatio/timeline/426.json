The reason is the line https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/fff9792fa4920a2f1bd04368df524c763c823344/examples/2d/plot_invert_scattering.py#L26 which specifies the image as a relative path from the working directory. Ideally, this would be done in a way that finds the file by looking at the path of the script instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/562686409","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/426#issuecomment-562686409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/426","id":562686409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjY4NjQwOQ==","user":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T18:29:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T18:29:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"It would really be great if we could purge this from the repo by rewriting `master`, but that may be risky given that people are actually using the software now (although, I assume, mostly through `pip`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/562686409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2975007699,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk3NTAwNzY5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2975007699","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-23T19:37:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
