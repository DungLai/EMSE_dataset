This can be significant in audio, in which one routinely has `Q1=16` and `Q2=1` or `=2`. So the tradeoff is a 2x speedup gain at the cost of a 16x or even x32 cost in RAM. The factor of `L1*L2 = 64` is what drew Oyallon Zagoruyko and Belilovsky towards a DFS implementation in Kymatio 2D, (called `pyscatwave` at the time), and this is how we ended up with DFS in every dimension.\r\n\r\nThe situation is different with JTFS because we must do some hybrid form of BFS and DFS; i.e., BFS at the first order and then DFS in the two cascaded filters (along time and along log-frequency) of the second order.\r\n\r\nI tend to see this issue as a particular case of #735 by

scatteringnd`.  then in each specific frontend, the call to the algorithm would be given by `self.scatteringalgo`. This would allow power users to define a breadth first search algorithm #798 , or define their own scattering implementation where they can retrieve coefficients #445 (tho, these futures should be one day in our code base, please see #735).\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
