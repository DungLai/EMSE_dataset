@eickenberg  In the 3D code it's 15% essentially because you have more complex multiplications than fourier transforms : in solid harmonic scattering transform, for 1 \"convolution\" with psi_l you have 2 FFT and 2L+1 complex multiplications, so speeding up complex multiplication really speeds up the whoel
