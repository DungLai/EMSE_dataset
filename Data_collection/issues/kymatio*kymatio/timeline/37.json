[x] Filter subsampling fixed\r\n- [x] Apply IFFT for U1, with related warnings and test (fixes #37 ).\r\n- [x] Warning for border effects due to padding for very small support sizes\r\n\r\n**Filters**\r\nBefore, the filters at all different downsamplings were computed independently from the formula. This led to zero filters for high downsamplings and low frequencies, because the central frequency of the wavelet was in between zero and the first DC frequency. I had not noticed this because I had only used this at low downsamplings (low `J`).\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the filter at the maximal resolution is computed from the formula, and its downsampled versions are computed by downsampling it - which is how it should be.\r\n\r\n**IFFT for U1**\r\nThe issue was clearly explained in #37 . I added the IFFT, followed by real part and unpadding at the corresponding resolution. Because all U1[lambda]x do not live at the same resolution, they cannot be stacked in the same tensor so I added an error when the option `vectorize` is `True` to be able to return a dictionary of Ux tensors\r\n\r\n**Warning for border effects**\r\nIn order to avoid border effects, the signal of support size `T` is padded on the left and on the right. The size of the padding is determined dynamically based on the temporal support of the low-pass. \r\n\r\nWhen the support `T` of the original filter is very small (`T <= 512 = 2**9`) and the scattering scale `2**J` is commensurate with `T`, then the decay of the low-pass is too slow to define a \"temporal support\": it behaves like a uniform averaging. Before, the software raised an error because it was not able to define the support of the low-pass in this case. Now, it issues a warning regarding the existence of border effects and continues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1925897960,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxOTI1ODk3OTYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/1925897960","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T11:04:06Z","assignee":{"login":"AndreuxMath","id":10076572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10076572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreuxMath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreuxMath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/433008487","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/37#issuecomment-433008487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/37","id":433008487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzAwODQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T11:04:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T11:04:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ok great.
