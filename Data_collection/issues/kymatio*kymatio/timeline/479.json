🐛 Bug\r\n\r\nCalling `torch.fft` on CUDA tensor in a `nn.DataParallel` wrapped module segfaults.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nRun the following script on PyTorch master (77c08aa46c3f3460b95b89cbe357b99180bc824d) on a machine with 2 or more GPUs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nimport torch.nn as nn\r\n\r\nclass FFTSEGV(nn.Module):\r\n    def
