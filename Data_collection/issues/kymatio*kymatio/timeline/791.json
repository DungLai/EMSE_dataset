This is especially important in JTFS, as we often really don't want a higher `F` invariance, but do want a higher `F` downsampling, and can afford generous amounts of it with minimal loss of information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1019183803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1019187305","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/791#issuecomment-1019187305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/791","id":1019187305,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c48v5Bp","user":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-22T11:07:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T11:08:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"OK, then i'm completely lost.

story short, I made a significant mistake in implementation that affects all configurations. Namely, unpadding and striding along frequency, in freq scattering. My bad.\r\n\r\nGood news is, only `aligned=False` and `'recalibrate'` are severely affected. `aligned=True` and `'resample'` may oversample for non-smallest `N_frs`, and `out_3D=False` may unpad incorrectly. It's possible, and likely, that `True` and `'resample'` work entirely correctly for a given config, just not guaranteed. Implications are \"excess data\" and \"some info lost\", and latter should be negligible in most cases.\r\n\r\nI will fix it, hopefully soon. I'll open it as a PR to #781, write a summary of changes to guide reviewers, and take any questions. For now, `'resample'` and `aligned=True` should work well enough.\r\n\r\n@lostanlen @rastegah @lylyhan

second-order coefficients, except spinned `j1_fr=0`, are oversampled, which drastically amplifies output size and overfitting. Arguably the worst configuration of all. We should either default to both `True` or both `False`.\r\n\r\nSince there's still some confusion, another attempt at explaining: `aligned=True` is an oversampled `aligned=False`. Filterbank parameters are independent of `aligned`, so in this sense the \"paths\" are unaffected.\r\n\r\n - 1D convs: all configs are valid. We pack `n2, n1_fr, n1` along channels, where they \"don't talk\" (every learned convolution filter sees only one path)\r\n - 2D convs: all `out_3D=True` configs are valid\r\n - 3D convs: all `out_3D=True` configs are valid if `n2` is packed along channels (so convolve over `(n1_fr, n1, t)` with spins split), since `out_3D=True` always enforces `aligned=True` on per-`n2` basis\r\n - 4D convs: no configs are valid. Only here is `aligned=False` a dealbreaker.\r\n - \"all configs\" assumes `'resample'`, since `'recalibrate'` breaks actual path alignment.\r\n\r\n#791 makes `average_fr=True` a close equivalent to `average_fr=False` on averting loss of information due to averaging up to a certain `F`, but that's for later.\r\n\r\n@lostanlen @janden","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1141267308","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/791#issuecomment-1141267308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/791","id":1141267308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c5EBlts","user":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-30T15:14:00Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T15:14:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Scattering iterators #735 will solve everything inshahallah ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1141267308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6703851361,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQLq_c5CG4KwzwAAAAGPlKdh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6703851361","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T15:14:00Z","state_reason":"not_planned","performed_via_github_app":null}]
