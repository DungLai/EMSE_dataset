remove deprecated `average` kwarg\r\n\r\nCloses #902 \r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n> Now that we have a `T` parameter (#673) and that `average` is deprecated (#884), i think it's time we consider passing `T='global'` to the constructor so that it skips the `phi` and performs a 1D uniform average, also known as \"global average pooling\", instead. This will be faster (`O(N)` instead of `O(N log N)`) and conceptually simpler than the default `T=None` (i.e., `2**J`).\r\n\r\nNote that this implementation does _not_ introduce new keyword arguments to the Scattering1D constructor. Rather, it special-cases a new string value for `T`: `'global'`. This is backwards compatible. Local averaging `T=2**J` remains and will remain the default.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, i have added a new Kymatio primitive, namely `sum`:\r\n\r\n`def sum(x, axis)`\r\nwhere `axis` is an `int` (for 1D) or `tuple` of `int`'s (for 2D/3D)\r\n\r\nThanks to the new generator of core implementation (#880), i am able to skip unpadding when performing global averaging. So this should be faster and memory-efficient, although i haven't formally tested it in practice.\r\n\r\nI have modified the internal values of `average` and the prototype of `core`, but this isn't anything the user accesses directly, so i guess it's fine to break things.\r\n(in fact we've been warning the user against accessing average for several months now. and core is now wrapped inside a unified frontend #908 so i don't see why users would call it directly)\r\n\r\nI have added a simple NumPy test, feel free to request more if you have ideas or specific use cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7184790066,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQLq_c5NQqBAzwAAAAGsPzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/7184790066","actor":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-14T14:38:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
