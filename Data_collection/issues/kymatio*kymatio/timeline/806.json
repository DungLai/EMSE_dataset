But Torch itself (1) has a mind-boggling number of non-Python dependencies, (2) comes in many flavors depending on platforms, and (3) has undergone tremendous breaking changes over the past few years.\r\n\r\nThis means that if a newcomer who's unfamiliar with PyTorch installs Kymatio, runs our tutorials, and encounters a runtime error, we will have to say: what's your conda/pip environment? what's your platform? what's your pytorch version?\r\nThose three daunting questions alone might shoo away the person who reported the problem and we might never be able to help them. Worse, it will mean we'll spend more time on dependency resolution and less on actual Kymatio code. Of course, a more experienced user (e.g., researcher) will readily answer those questions; but that demographic is also the one that's most capable at helping themself.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the SciPy/NumPy stack has ~20 years of experience of working with complex numbers and linear algebra. PyTorch. According to PyTorch documentation: (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/complex_numbers.html)\r\n\r\n> Complex tensors is a beta feature and subject to change.\r\n\r\nSo there is no possible comparison in terms of maturity and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Google Colab is a very popular environment for budding deep learners, novice data scientists, and students (my undergrad encouraged us to use Google Colab). Torch is already preinstalled on the python environments there.\r\n\r\nTying ourselves to a corporate environment is a seductive but dangerous idea.\r\nBut again, don't we have the best of both worlds with\r\n```\r\nfrom kymatio.torch import Scattering1D, Scattering2D\r\n```\r\n? \r\nWhich should work out of the box in Google Colab?\r\n\r\n> For example, in this JTFS PR, we are focusing on getting the Numpy version out first. Ignoring the [recent work+repo relese by your group with JTFS and unsupervised learning,](https://github.com/rastegah/kymatio-jtfs) this development process focusing on Numpy first delays getting our users a stable version of a GPU enabled, differentiable scattering.\r\n\r\nTake that to @OverLordGoldDragon who wrote the code.\r\n\r\n> I will be radical and state that infact we should not support Numpy in the main library (that is, we fork it!) and that we should be totally focused instead on supporting Tensorflow, Jax, and Torch. ;)\r\n\r\nFrankly, i could let myself convinced. But i am concerned about obsolescence.\r\nHere's an anecdote: between 2013 and 2015, Joakim and i wrote implementations of JTFS in MATLAB. These implementations still run fine to this day (2022).\r\nIn January 2016, i wrote a neural network implementation in Keras/Theano. The implementation was already no longer compatible with latest stable Keras when i presented my paper in the Summer of 2016.\r\n\r\nSo yes let's think about the researchers of the current day, but also those of the day after that.\r\n\r\nJust my party-spoiler thoughts. If you think the pros outweight the cons, and you bet that PyTorch will become as stable as is current NumPy, _and_ (most importantly) if you're willing to take the responsibility of helping newcomers troubleshoot their PyTorch-based Kymatio installations, then by all means, let me retract what i wrote above and let's boldly go (back) to PyTorch as default backend.\r\n\r\nThis is something worth discussing viva voce on May 19 :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1113966458/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6527911502,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5IT-mQzwAAAAGFGAZO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6527911502","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-30T10:45:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6527911503,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5IT-mQzwAAAAGFGAZP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6527911503","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-30T10:45:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6527911504,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5IT-mQzwAAAAGFGAZQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6527911504","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created
