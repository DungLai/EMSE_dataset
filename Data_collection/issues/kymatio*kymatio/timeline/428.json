There is no simple way to extend Kymatio beyond second-order scattering at the moment. The computational graph of Kymatio is based on depth-first search, so second-order scattering is achieved via two nested for loops. To obtain third-order scattering, one would have to write a triply nested for loop.\r\n\r\nNote that the github.com/scatnet/scatnet MATLAB/Octave library supports third-order scattering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/529396403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2618104711,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxODEwNDcxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2618104711","actor":{"login":"tingyuansen","id":1833554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1833554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen","html_url":"https://github.com/tingyuansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-09T10:03:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2618104714,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTgxMDQ3MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2618104714","actor":{"login":"tingyuansen","id":1833554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1833554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen","html_url":"https://github.com/tingyuansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tingyuansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-09T10:03:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2618105341,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYxODEwNTM0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2618105341","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-09T10:03:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
