The sizes of these arrays will be different.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of your image and your choice of `J` and `L`, this may exceed your available RAM, because there cannot be any subsampling in the absence of nonlinearities.

Therefore, the output is no longer real and nonnegative, but complex-valued. Furthermore, because wavelets are analytical, they have zero average, and therefore the output of the scattering transform without nonlinearity will also have a zero average. If you were to subsample that output more than the scale of the wavelet at hand, you will end up with aliasing the result.
