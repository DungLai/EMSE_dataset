Each wavelet's centre frequency is defined as `xi = pi / 2^j` for `j = {0 .. J}`. Therefore `J` determines the lowest centre frequency of the filterbank and also the number of octaves. \r\n\r\nHigher scale --> lower centre frequency, greater temporal support, finer frequency resolution.\r\n\r\nWe delivered this [tutorial](https://github.com/cyrusvahidi/scat1d-tutorial) for 1D scattering at the Kymatio 2022 workshop. This delves into the filterbank parameters a bit more. The `.meta()` method provides all metadata associated with the values in the output tensor. You can use it to determine the scattering path's parameters.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1186164899/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7006058447,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5NqUUCzwAAAAGhl_fP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/7006058447","actor":{"login":"skolari93","id":86524751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTI0NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86524751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93","html_url":"https://github.com/skolari93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-16T11:55:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7006058448,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5NqUUCzwAAAAGhl_fQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/7006058448","actor":{"login":"skolari93","id":86524751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTI0NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86524751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93","html_url":"https://github.com/skolari93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolari93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-16T11:55:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7048333428,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQLq_c5NqUUCzwAAAAGkHQh0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/7048333428","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T18:20:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1193657577","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/904#issuecomment-1193657577","issue_url":"https://a
