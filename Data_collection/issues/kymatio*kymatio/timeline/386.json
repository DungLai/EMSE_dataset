That's not a bug because normally the signal has been padded such that 2^j divides the dimensions. normalized=True might work and would be probably the most efficient!\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > * Normalizing the wavelet in the Fourier domain (ie the file filter_bank.py) to avoid the new code to break and satisfy the previous unit tests\r\n> \r\n> In `filter_bank.py`, it seems wavelets are being normalized in lines 56\r\n> \r\n> `psi[res] /= M*N// 2**(2*j)`\r\n> \r\n> and 72\r\n> \r\n> `filters['phi'][res] /= M*N // 2 ** (2 * J)`\r\n> \r\n> Also, we donâ€™t use fft from `backend_`, we are only using fft2 from `utils.py`.

The reason is that some days, the software might become compatible with tensorflow and thus, we can't hardcode this kind of dependancy for users not willing to install torch. Numpy is however pretty standard and almost installed by default","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/498216829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/501892668","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/386#issuecomment-501892668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/386","id":501892668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTg5MjY2OA==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-13T21:53:09Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T21:53:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi, can you propose a PR of what you did until now?
