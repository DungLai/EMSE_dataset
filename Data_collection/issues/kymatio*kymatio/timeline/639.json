In the mean time, would you be able to write a minimal example piece of code that exhibits this discrepancy? Something like this for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom kymatio.torch import HarmonicScattering3D\r\nJ = 7\r\nL = 4\r\nintegral_powers = (1.,)\r\nscattering = HarmonicScattering3d(shape=(64, 64, 64), J=J, L=L, integral_powers=integral_powers)\r\nx = torch.randn(2, 64, 64, 64)\r\nout = scattering(x)\r\nassert out.shape == x.shape[0], J * (J - 1) // 2, L + 1, len(integral_powers)\r\n```\r\n\r\n^ I wrote the above without running it, so it may be inexact. The goal is to have a failing test case that we can then fix.

The 2D API has an `out_type=\"list\"` option that helps with this, but for the 3D documentation, I'm not certain what \"concatenated along the feature axis\" [here](https://www.kymat.io/codereference.html) means for the ordering of the coefficients.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/761917713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mburhanpurkar","id":16613221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjEzMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16613221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar","html_url":"https://github.com/mburhanpurkar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mburhanpurkar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4474937192,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NDQ3NDkzNzE5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4474937192","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-18T09:57:57Z","milestone":{"title":"sprint"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T01:07:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T01:07:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/820","id":1252958071,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCQLq_c44seh1","number":820,"title":"DOC
