`Scattering3D` takes an input of shape `(B, M, N, O)`, where `B` is the batch size and `M, N, O` is the shape of the input signal. Depending on `method`, the output takes different formats:\r\n\r\n- If `method='standard'`, the output is of shape `(B, 2*M*N*O, total_scales, L+1)`, where `total_scales` is the number of scales at all orders, that is `(J+1)+J*(J+1)/2` if `order_2=True`. The factor `2` in the second axis comes from the fact that these are still stored as \"complex\" values (even though they are real), so every other element along that axis is zero. These zeroes should probably be eliminated.\r\n- If `method='integral'`, the output is of shape `(B, len(integral_powers), total_scales, L+1)`, where `integral_powers` is the argument provided to `forward()`.\r\n- If `method='local'`, the output is of shape `(B, points.shape[1], total_scales, L+1)`, where `points` is the argument provided to `forward()`.\r\n\r\nThe first question is whether we should provide all these outputs through the same interface. To a certain extent, `'integral'` and `'local'` can be computed from `'standard'`, but this may not be computationally optimal.\r\n\r\nThe second question is how to structure these outputs to be more consistent with 1D and 2D. I suggest that we adopt a similar output shape `(B, C, M, N, O)`, where the second axis comingles orders, scales, ells, integral powers, and points, as the case may be. Alternatively, for `'integral`' and `'local'`, the third axis could index `integral_powers` or `points` instead of a singleton spatial dimension.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T05:55:52Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T05:55:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/234","id":390972881,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM4NjE1ODE2","number":234,"title":"API
