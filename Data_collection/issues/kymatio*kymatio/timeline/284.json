was trying the Scattering2D on my data and it did not work. I had this error message: \r\n>RuntimeError: The filters are not compatible for multiplication!\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I found out that the padding does not work well with some input shapes. Here is a minimal example:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nimport torch\r\nr = torch.randn(1, 1, 45, 45)\r\n\r\nfrom kymatio import Scattering2D\r\nscatterer = Scattering2D(J=3, shape=tuple(r.size()[2:]))\r\n\r\nfrom kymatio.scattering2d.backend import fft\r\nprint(scatterer.Phi[0].size()) # size -> torch.Size([56, 56, 2])\r\nprint(fft(scatterer.pad(r), 'C2C').size()) # this is the 'U_0_c' size -> torch.Size([1, 1, 61, 61, 2])\r\nprint(scatterer.forward(r))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried other matrix shapes and it seems that the `U_0_c` size, in axis `d=2,3`, is equal to the size of `Phi[0]`, in axis `d-2`, plus the rest of the Euclidian division of the original size, in axis `d-2`, on `2^J`. This causes the later uncatched exception.\r\n\r\nWas this unintended? or was it the contrary (which implies that I have to choose a good `J` value)?\r\n\r\nIf it is the last case, how to choose `J` when I have no guaranty over the input sizes?
