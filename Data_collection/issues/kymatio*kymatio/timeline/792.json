Looks like you already tried to pull something like that off. What I did to make it work is to replace the `Pad` object used in the tensorflow implemenation with:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Pad(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, pad_size, input_size):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Padding which allows to simultaneously pad in a reflection fashion\r\n        and map to complex.\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        pad_size : list of 4 integers\r\n            size of padding to apply.\r\n        input_size : list of 2 integers\r\n            size of the original signal\r\n        Added a correction to this class for reflection padding to work in tensorflow when padding size is the same as input size\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        self.pad_size = pad_size\r\n        self.input_size = input_size\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, x):\r\n\r\n        paddings = [[0, 0]] * len(x.shape[:-2])\r\n        paddings += [\r\n            [self.pad_size[0], self.pad_size[1]],\r\n            [self.pad_size[2], self.pad_size[3]],\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n        # Reflection paddding doesn't work if padding size is same as image size. Therefore, pad with N-1\r\n        if self.pad_size[0] == self.input_size[0]:\r\n            paddings[1][0] -= 1\r\n            paddings[1][1] -= 1\r\n        if self.pad_size[2] == self.input_size[1]:\r\n            paddings[2][0] -= 1\r\n            paddings[2][1] -= 1\r\n\r\n        x = tf.cast(tf.pad(x, paddings, mode=\"REFLECT\"), tf.complex64)\r\n\r\n        # Since we only padded with N-1, we repeat the signal at the edges (adding another reflection) to get the right output size image\r\n        if self.pad_size[0] == self.input_size[0]:\r\n            x = tf.concat(\r\n                (\r\n                    tf.expand_dims(x[:, 1, :], axis=1),\r\n                    x,\r\n                    tf.expand_dims(x[:, x.shape[1] - 2, :], axis=1),\r\n                ),\r\n                axis=1,\r\n            )\r\n        if self.pad_size[2] == self.input_size[1]:\r\n            x = tf.concat(\r\n                (\r\n                    tf.expand_dims(x[:, :, 1], axis=2),\r\n                    x,\r\n                    tf.expand_dims(x[:, :, x.shape[2] - 2], axis=2),\r\n                ),\r\n                axis=2,\r\n            )\r\n\r\n        return \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does make it work and I think I did some tests and it behaved the same as the Torch backend operator, although this should probably be properly tested to make sure it works properly.
