I am saying at a minium we can have Scattering be accessible through only the Scattering2d object. So for example the user would only import from one file\r\n\r\n`import Scattering2d as Scattering \r\n\r\nScattering(28,28,3) #to use the fast scattering\r\nScattering(28,28,3,differentiable=True) #to use the differentiable version`\r\n\r\n> > More cleanly I think would be to integrate the code for modulus, periodize, cdgmm, etc and simply have the Scattering init object select which ones will be used later\r\n> \r\n> That's the backend style of coding I had in mind.. not sure how to incorporate it/if it makes sens now\r\n\r\nI guess this would be slightly trickier than the option above but I still dont see why its so complex. The modulus,periodize,cdgmm funcitons you define in differentiably.py are already defined inside utils.py when the user calls jit=False for their initializer. So the only thing to do would be to build a unified interface for the fft calls isnt that right? Cant it be done the same way (jit=False) would trigger a diff behavior in __call__ \r\n\r\n> \r\n> > @eickenberg
