call it.\r\n\r\nIt would be a nice change for power users if we instead imported the algorithm in the base frontend and defined a variable to contain the call i.e. `self.scatteringalgo = scatteringnd`.  then in each specific frontend, the call to the algorithm would be given by `self.scatteringalgo`. This would allow power users to define a breadth first search algorithm #798 , or define their own scattering implementation where they can retrieve coefficients #445 (tho, these futures should be one day in our code base, please see #735).\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6703981319,"node_id":"DEME_lADOCQLq_c4ehw1CzwAAAAGPlqMH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6703981319","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T15:34:56Z","milestone":{"title":"0.3.alpha"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
