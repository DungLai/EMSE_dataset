The way I understand it, it should just require \"wrapping\" the `forward()` methods to do a reshape of the input, save the shape of the indexing/batch dimensions, then reshape the output to match that. We would still keep the convention of `(P, T)` and `(P, M, N)`, etc. for the last three, where `P` indexes the path.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I see much \"hard-coding\" of assumptions here. The meta information can map the path variable (i.e., the second-to-last in 1D, third-to-last in 2D, etc.) to lists of lists or anything else. The only restriction here is that all the coefficients be of the same `(M, N)` size. Now whether that is a good idea or not is up for debate.\r\n\r\n> I should add that whatever decision we take should be informed by future plans of implementing routines for multivariables scattering transforms, including:\r\n> \r\n>     * roto-translation\r\n> \r\n>     * time-frequency\r\n> \r\n>     * 1-D x 1-D  (images in which the horizontal and vertical dimensions are not physically homogeneous)\r\n> \r\n>     * 1-D x 2-D (videos)\r\n\r\nFor the first two, I don't think this affects the the conventions. Roto-translation takes images (2D signals) as input, so would fall under `(M, N) -> (P, M/2**J, N/2**J)`. Similarly, time-frequency takes 1D signals and would fall under `(T,) -> (P, T/2**J)`. I think the other two would fall under similar conventions with a scattering path index that would index all the different coefficients.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/439959974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/439964899","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/158#issuecomment-439964899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/158","id":439964899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTk2NDg5OQ==","user":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T16:57:49Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T16:57:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Sure, but why should this make the scattering transform give \"channels\" special treatment?

I'm OK with leaving this as post-processing but that represents a big operation of memory copy, which will slow down the code considerably. One of the core reasons why scattering.m is so fast is that the IFFT happens exactly where the coefficients need to be placed for the net layer.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me what `j1_max < j2_min` implies. At any rate, that's quite a strong constraint to impose to suit a scattering regime that is \"not unheard of.\" Sure, you can fill with zeros and you may improve performance by copying less memory for some tasks, but for other tasks you're decreasing performance by unnecessarily multiplying by lots of zeros and increasing memory usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/440018461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1975586448,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk3NTU4NjQ0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/1975586448","actor":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-19T19:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1975586450,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NzU1ODY0NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/1975586450","actor":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-19T19:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1975586452,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk3NTU4NjQ1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/1975586452","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-19T19:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1975586454,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NzU1ODY0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/1975586454","actor":{"login":"edouard
