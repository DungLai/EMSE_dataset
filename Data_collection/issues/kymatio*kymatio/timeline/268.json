In a broader sense, there is a question of stability of the output with respect to custom parameters of Kymatio, either at \"compile time\" (Kymatio constructor) or \"run time\" (forward of the network).\r\nThe different levels of stability are:\r\n1. same sizes, different values\r\n2. same number of dimensions, different sizes\r\n3. same Tensor type, different number of dimensions\r\n4. different return type, same number of output arguments\r\n5. different number of outputs arguments\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, option (1) is too restrictive for our purposes, and option (5) will create a lot of confusion on the part of the user.
