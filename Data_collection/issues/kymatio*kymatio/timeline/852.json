#852 and does more :)\r\n\r\nThis PR removes five input arguments from the core `scattering1d` function while respecting backwards compatibility. \r\nIt will add a few lines of code inside `scattering1d` but will make calls for the 1D core way more lightweight and readable.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's how i did it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npad = backend.pad\r\nunpad = backend.unpad\r\n\r\n# compute the padding quantities:\r\nN = x.shape[-1]\r\nN_pad = phi[0].shape[-1]\r\npad_left, pad_right = compute_padding(N, N_pad)\r\n\r\n# compute start and end indices\r\nlog2_T = phi[\"j\"]\r\nJ = max(max(map(itemgetter(\"j\"), psi1)), max(map(itemgetter(\"j\"), psi2)))\r\nind_start, ind_end = compute_border_indices(log2_T, J, pad_left, pad_left+N)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI only had to modify `compute_padding` so that it takes `N, N_pad` as argument instead of `J_pad,N`. But it's equivalent since`N_pad=2**J_pad`.\r\n\r\nThis first commit is a fully working example, ready for review. After it's accepted, i'll take care of cleaning up extra keyword arguments from core and call sites (TF/PT/NP frontends) and will confirm the new prototype of `scattering1d` and `compute_padding`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1151020462","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/852#issuecomment-1151020462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/852","id":1151020462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c5Emy2u","user":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T11:46:09Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T11:46:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sounds

(but does not fully fix)  #852 \r\n\r\nThird PR in a streak (after #860 and #861), attempting to simplify core 1D scattering and decouple its functionalities.\r\nThis time the offender is `out_type` and the post-processing that comes after the scattering transform per se.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that there isn't much of a reason to write a backend-agnostic implementation of this formatting stage, considering that it's already divided into `\"array\"`, `\"dict\"` and `\"list\"` cases.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR brings us closer than we've ever been to a `Scattering1D` generator, which would `yield` coefficients instead of `return`-ing them. Hence a _big_ simplification in scope once we're able to decouple `scattering1d` from padding, averaging, and unpadding
