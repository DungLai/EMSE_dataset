 Thank you again for the time you are spending on this. Don't know enough of Keras (and even less of kymatio) to make a sensible suggestion on what dictionary to put under get config. In the meantime, a reasonable fix seems to upgrade to the latest tensorflow and to save in tensorflow SaveModel format. This works for the kymatio example script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model, model_from_json, load_model\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Flatten, Dense\r\nimport json\r\n\r\nimport kymatio\r\nfrom kymatio.keras import Scattering2D\r\n\r\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()\r\nx_train, x_test = x_train / 255., x_test / 255.\r\n\r\ninputs = Input(shape=(28, 28))\r\nx = Scattering2D(J=3, L=8)(inputs)\r\nx = Flatten()(x)\r\nx_out = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)\r\nmodel = Model(inputs, x_out)\r\n\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\r\n              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\r\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\r\nmodel.fit(x_train[:500], y_train[:500], epochs=1,\r\n          batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)\r\n\r\nmodel.evaluate(x_test[:500], y_test[:500])\r\n```\r\n16/16 [==============================] - 15s 949ms/step - loss: 2.2898 - accuracy: 0.2540\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Save as tensorflow SaveModel format\r\nmodel.save('model_all')\r\n\r\n# Reload as 'reconstructed_model'\r\nreconstructed_model = load_model(\"model_all\")\r\n\r\nreconstructed_model.evaluate(x_test[:500], y_test[:500]) \r\n```\r\n16/16 [==============================] - 19s 1s/step - loss: 2.2898 - accuracy: 0.2540\r\n \r\nAlthough still fails (with a plethora of error messages) with the large model I work with.
