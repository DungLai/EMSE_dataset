#423 \r\n\r\nThe code requires a lot of refactoring. Simple todo for this PR:\r\n\r\n- [x] Removing torch dependency in https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/utils.py as well as in https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/core/scattering3d.py .\r\n- [x] Clearly specifying which functions are part of the backend, which are not. For instance, https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/utils.py#L54-L55 or https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/utils.py#L59-L83 are beyond utility functions and should be declared in the appropriate file (probably a `backend.py`).\r\n- [x] Removing complex interlacements between simple operations. For instance, https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/core/scattering3d.py#L123-L159 could be refactored, in order to clearly show what is done in the code.(if I wasn't familiar with 3D scattering, I would have had a hard time to follow)\r\n\r\n- [x] As https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/core/scattering3d.py#L162-L194 is an elementary function(similarly to a complex modulus), shouldn't it be part of the backend?\r\n- [x] https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/core/scattering3d.py#L228-L243 is pretty analogous to standard scattering (e.g., current 1-2D or future 3D with Gaussian filters), maybe it could be nice to emphasize it.\r\n- [x] The model of https://github.com/edouardoyallon/kymatio/blob/attempt_3D/kymatio/scattering3d/filter_bank.py is slightly different from what is done in other part of the software. While this is not a bad behaviour for future work, this does not follow the current template, and thus adding filters(hopefully some contributors will add some wavelets beyond Gabor) might be complex here.\r\n- [x] **When everything above is done, add first a numpy frontend,...**\r\n- [x] ...and then a tensorflow frontend.\r\n- [x] ~~The documentation should be drastically improved.~~ to improve everywhere\r\n- [x] ~~It seems to me that the current code can not support super large array on GPU. I think this could be however easily handled with an appropriate backend, for instance by unloading from GPU's memory large tensors. Actually, one could think of two backends: one when large memory is available, and one for contexts of limited resources.~~ too much work for now\r\n\r\nThis time, that's too much work for me! 😉
