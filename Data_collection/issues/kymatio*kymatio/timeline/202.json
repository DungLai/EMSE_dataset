all,\r\nFirst of all, thank you so much for this library.  The scattering transform has turned out to be a great tool in some of my research recently, and it's great not to have to create ugly wrappers around Matlab scatnet.\r\n\r\nWhen getting this setup, however, I noticed that the API has changed slightly, so that Scattering2D expects a tuple shape parameter, instead of two separate dimensions.  Just an FYI.\r\nMany thanks,\r\nChris Tralie","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
