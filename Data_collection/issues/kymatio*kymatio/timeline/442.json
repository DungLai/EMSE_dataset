In the meantime, your only short-term option is to use MATLAB language alternatives. I am sorry about that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/544963032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/545552685","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/442#issuecomment-545552685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/442","id":545552685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTU1MjY4NQ==","user":{"login":"blibliki","id":33557742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU3NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33557742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki","html_url":"https://github.com/blibliki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T17:30:41Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T17:30:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your answer!\r\nI will check MATLAB as advised!  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/545552685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"blibliki","id":33557742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU3NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33557742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki","html_url":"https://github.com/blibliki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2737940781,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjczNzk0MDc4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2737940781","actor":{"login":"blibliki","id":33557742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU3NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33557742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki","html_url":"https://github.com/blibliki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blibliki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-23T17:30:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
