explicit guard against bandpasses ending up as pure sines.\r\n\r\nSee images. Attaining a proper wavelet can be very costly on padding, but at the same time we want to tile the entire frequency axis; I thus introduced `max_pad_factor` in latest JTFS, so user can choose faster compute at expense of boundary effects in small fraction of coefficients.\r\n\r\nRationale for `xi_min = 2/N` is, minimal possible wavelet is made with 3 samples in frequency domain (arguably 2), so peak cannot lie on bin 1, thus we put it at bin 2. As shown in \"this PR only\", this alone doesn't guarantee a good wavelet - it does, however, spare much padding that'd be required to make `psi1_f[-1]` a proper wavelet.\r\n\r\nNote that other PRs in progress will allow a bandpass to become exactly a pure sine, exacerbating the problem.\r\n\r\n### Current
