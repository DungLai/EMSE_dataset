thanks for opening this issue\r\n\r\n> why did we need contiguous tensors in the first place?\r\n \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/69840389/what-functions-or-modules-require-contiguous-input/\r\n\"it seems that view is the only function that explicitly causes an exception when a non-contiguous input is passed.\"\r\n \r\n It makes sense that our users would like to call `view`on the return value of Kymatio, so guaranteeing contiguity of the _output_ is the safest choice here. However, since we never call `view` in base code, my understanding is that it's fine if some _intermediate_ computation of Kymatio is non-contiguous. By that logic, the repeated contiguity checks in Kymatio primitives are unnecessary. And the contiguity enforcement in #972 might as well have appeared later in the processing pipeline. (on the subsampled unpadded array rather than the intermediate one)\r\n \r\n > can we copy the tensor and force contiguity?\r\n \r\n That's what #972 does.\r\n By definition, an in-place transpose breaks contiguity but allocates no memory. An out-of-place transpose respects contiguity but allocates memory. \r\n\r\n> is there a more efficient approach?\r\n\r\nMy view (pun intended) is that we can defer the contiguity checks/allocations to the latest stage of the transform instead of having them in `swap_timefrequency`. This should be more efficient than #972 while passing the current unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe implication of what i'm saying is that we'd have to say goodbye to the contiguity checks in backend primitives.\r\n\r\nLMK what you think!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1300936042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1313778180","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/974#issuecomment-1313778180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/974","id":1313778180,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c5OTqoE","user":{"login":"cyrusvahidi","id":10761938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzYxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10761938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi","html_url":"https://github.com/cyrusvahidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyrusvahidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T14:15:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T14:15:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Bon.\r\n\r\nDo
