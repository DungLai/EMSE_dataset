part of our discussion on separating the wavelet scale from the averaging scale, we realized that the variable T is already being used in 1D for the size of the signals.

M depends solely on the Scattering1D object, not on the input itself.\r\n\r\nThen, given a signal x of length N>>M, divide x into C overlapping chunks of length M. I think that a default overlap of 50% is sensible.\r\nNote that padding is only needed for the first and last chunk. For all the chunks in between, we can use overlap as a form of \"natural padding\".\r\n\r\nIn scattering.m i have experimented with two variants of this chunking procedure: \"Hann\" and \"Tukey\", after the name of the window functions applied to every chunk. In both variants, the number of scattering frames per chunk should be a multiple of 4. (so N=4T sounds about right?)\r\n\r\nHere's the layout i imagine: \r\n```\r\nchunk A: 0 1 2 3\r\nchunk B:     0 1 2 3\r\nchunk C:         0 1 2 3\r\nchunk D:             0 1 2 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n(again, this example takes 4 frames per chunk but the idea can work with more frames too)\r\n\r\nIn the Hann variant, one would sum the responses on a per-chunk basis (no FFT needed!) and end up with the sequence [A, B, C, D] \r\nThe appeal of this is that it potentially allows us to skip the phi  conv stage and replace it by this per-chunk sum which has linear complexity.\r\nSo i think that the Hann variant could be the best choice if (1)average=True  and (2) the averaging scaleT is greater or equal than the maximum wavelet scale\r\nNow, in the Tukey variant, one would discard the 25% left portion and the 25% right portion of every chunk\r\n```\r\nchunk A:   1 2 \r\nchunk B:       1 2 \r\nchunk C:           1 2 \r\nchunk D:               1 2 \r\n```\r\n \r\nand then stitch the segments together:\r\n[A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2]\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the Tukey variant is the best choice if average=False or if T  is smaller than the maximum wavelet scale\r\n\r\n@OverLordGoldDragon
