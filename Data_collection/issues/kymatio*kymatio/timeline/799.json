This choice formatting defeats the purpose of returning a 3-D tensor: the tuple `(n1, n2)` really should be raveled into a single index `n` and the mis-`aligned` tensor should be reshaped as a matrix `n`.

That is, `x` means the conv kernel is centered in the padded region and contains less (or no) information, whereas `4` centers at `input[4]`. And `input` is `U1`, so the numbers are indexing `xi1` (i.e. are actual `n1`).\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata -> padded\r\n16   -> 128\r\n64   -> 128\r\n\r\nFalse:\r\n  [0,  4,  8, 16]  # stride 4\r\n  [0, 16, 32, 48]  # stride 16\r\n  \r\nTrue:\r\n  [0,  x,  x,  x]  # stride 16\r\n  [0, 16, 32, 48]  # stride 16\r\n```\r\nThis does not defeat a 3D tensor if we pack it as `(n2, n1_fr, n1_mod, t)`, where `n1_mod == n1` for `aligned=True`.\r\n\r\n_Per_ `n2` we have `aligned=True`. `n2` is packed along channels. So,\r\n\r\n> There is nothing to be aligned\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1102803378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6703717378,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQLq_c5GQ_LLzwAAAAGPkpwC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6703717378","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T14:53:40Z","state_reason":"not_planned","performed_via_github_app":null}]
