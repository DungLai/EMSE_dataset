We store them between 0 and 1 because we don't know the sample rate of the signal that the user provided. The value `0.5` represents the Nyquist frequency, i.e., half the sampling frequency as per Shannon's theorem.\r\nIn discrete-time digital signal processing, it is customary to map the values of `xi` to the range `[0, 2*pi]` but we figured that this factor of `2*pi` could be skipped entirely for our computation, and would introduce unnecessary complexity when a human would read those values.\r\n\r\nOne last thing: note that, in most cases, they don't range between 0 and 1 but between 0 and 0.5 at most. This is because we assume that the input signal is real, and thus its Fourier transform is symmetric. In other words, we assume that the spectrum between `0.5` and `1` is the mirror of the spectrum between `0` and `0.5`. Thus, we only perform wavelet analysis over the `[0, 0.5]` range to avoid duplicating computations (and coefficients).\r\n\r\nI hope this
