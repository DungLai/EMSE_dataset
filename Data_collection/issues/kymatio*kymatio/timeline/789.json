What is the role of `sigma0` in all this, and why should it be tunable, as opposed to derived from T?\r\nCan't we fully specify a filterbank (both psis and phi) from the knowledge of `T`, `Q`, `J` ?\r\n\r\nIIUC this value of `sigma0=0.1` what chosen heuristically so as to design `phi` from `T`. But now you want to attach a precise meaning to `T` in terms of invariance property (i support this idea!): hence `sigma0` should no longer be tunable, right? Meaning the constant 0.13 should somehow be discovered at runtime in Kymatio, and not be a loose parameter.\r\n\r\nI must admit i still don't understand how this interacts with padding, subsampling and criterion_amplitude. Are you saying that the amount of empirical invariance you measure depends itself on boundary effects, which itself depends on how much we pad? So you want to redesign the filters to account for those boundary effects and better satisfy the required invariance T?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1019174158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1031487971","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/789#issuecomment-1031487971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/789","id":1031487971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c49e0Hj","user":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T13:48:26Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T13:48:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"LMK if this has been [clarified](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/781#issuecomment-1021412470) -- summary: `sigma0` _is_ derived from `T`, it simply always evaluates to `0.13` or close to.
