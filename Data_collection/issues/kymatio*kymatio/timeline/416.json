PR proposes a new mechanism for computing the scattering, that splits low level and high level calls, for the 2D scattering.\r\n\r\nExample of call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom kymatio.scattering2d import Scattering2D_torch as Scattering2D\r\nfrom kymatio.scattering2d.backend import torch_backend as backend\r\nscattering = Scattering2D(J, shape=(M, N), pre_pad=pre_pad, backend=backend)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nfrom kymatio.scattering2d import Scattering2D_torch as Scattering2D\r\nscattering = Scattering2D(J, shape=(M, N), pre_pad=pre_pad)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix #414 \r\nFix #398 \r\nFix #421 \r\nFix #416\r\nFix #402 \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Add a backend and frontend support.\r\n2. Refactors the scattering into a functional manner: frontend, backend and core. Frontend calls core, which relies on backend to compute primitives.\r\n3. Refactors the tests into classes, via pytest. Each submodule of the backend is tested via a pytest class. The frontend is globally tested via a pytest class.\r\n4. Split frontend, backend and core into different subfolders.\r\n5. Remove the previous backend that was using config files, and redefines a backend as a possible argument to the frontend.\r\n6. Support a pure numpy and tensorflow backend.\r\n7. Add a template for the frontend\r\n8. Pass the backend as a namedtuple\r\n\r\n\r\n__TODO in a future PR__: Updating the documentation, testing the multi GPU support, incorporating more tests for the numpy backend, unifications, more tests for the backend-frontend links(e.g., avoiding a numpy backend on a torch backend), adding the 1D-3D core","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2976098977,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk3NjA5ODk3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2976098977","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-24T04:59:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
