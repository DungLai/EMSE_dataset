However, Kymatio may occasionally return small negative values. Indeed, Kymatio doesn't guarantee that the low-pass filter phi is nonnegative. We build phi in the Fourier domain as a Gaussian, and the inverse Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian, so presumably phi should be positive both in the time domain and in the Fourier domain. But, in practice, phi turns out to be a truncated Gaussian in the Fourier domain, and thus a Gaussian convolved with sine cardinal in the time domain. This convolution with a sine cardinal profile causes some aliasing, leading to negative coefficients.\r\n\r\nIt imagine it could be possible to make the output more numerically accurate, at some cost in speed.\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely need nonnegative scattering coefficients (in NMF for example), consider passing `average=False` to Kymatio and taking care of averaging yourself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/818676017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/819274401","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/719#issuecomment-819274401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/719","id":819274401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTI3NDQwMQ==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T06:49:24Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T06:49:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Would you please have an example to reproduce this?

Upon closer look, i think that there's no problem with the way our filter bank is set here. The fact that we perform the convolution with phi in the Fourier domain necessarily incurs some loss in floating-point precision.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom kymatio.numpy import Scattering2D\r\nshape = (32, 32)\r\nscattering = Scattering2D(J=2, shape=shape)\r\nx = np.zeros(shape)\r\nx[16, 16] = 1\r\nSx = scattering(x).ravel()\r\nidx = np.argsort(Sx)\r\nplt.plot(np.log10(np.abs(Sx))[idx])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-04-15 at 14 36 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3943142/114870646-b6d82180-9df8-11eb-8fe0-c8a87fee9cfb.png)\r\n\r\nAll coefficients in the range [-1e-6, 1e-6] do not have a reliable amplitude (nor sign!) and should be considered numerically zero.
