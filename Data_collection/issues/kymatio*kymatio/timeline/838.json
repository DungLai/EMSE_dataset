We already have `meta` as a function, so the same should be true of `output_size`.

So just to make sure I've got this right, precompute_size_scattering will fix detail=True and output_size will fix detail=False?\r\n\r\nYes, that's what we just said ... but that would remove useful functionality, namely the `out_size(detail=True)` non-default. So i'm no longer in favor of it (at first, i believed that `out_size()` was currently `detail`-ed by default, but the opposite is true)\r\n\r\nLooking back at it, i don't think there's much to be done here, except maybe removing the confusing `detail` keyword argument from `precompute_size_scattering`, and doing the summation inside `out_size`. This will be fully backwards compatible and will reduce the number of conditional branches in unit tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1151084298/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1154386281","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/838#issuecomment-1154386281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/838","id":1154386281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCQLq_c5Ezolp","user":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T20:16:15Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T20:16:15Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"All right.
