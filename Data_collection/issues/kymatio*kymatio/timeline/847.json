up in conversation with @MuawizChaudhary \r\n\r\nA sequel of #847 : `compute_params_filterbank` should be simpler\r\nAt the moment, this function returns three output values: `xis`, `sigmas`, and `js`\r\n\r\nBut it turns out that every `j` can be derived from `xi` and `sigma` by means of \r\n `j = get_max_dyadic_subsampling(xi, sigma, alpha)`\r\n \r\nWhich we could have in the `scattering_filter_factory` itself.\r\nThis will avoid carrying over a term back-and-forth between the \"factory\" and the \"params\"\r\n\r\nin hindsight, this is also beneficial for distinguishing wavelet params (xis, sigmas) from their sampling
