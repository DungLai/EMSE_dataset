I know nothing about this, but I can see how, if the locations of the atoms are known (and they are, in the case of a known molecule), it might make sense to only evaluate U at the nuclei of these atoms, and then derive some quantum chemical properties out of the scattering coefficients of \"each atom\".\r\nLikewise, in the foveated scattering of Mathieu and Ravi, the \"points\" method is used for prediction: causal wavelets (truncated Gabors) estimate U0 at t=0 (in other words, the present time) to predict the value of x at t=delta for small delta. So having a `points` in 1D would also make sense for that.\r\n\r\nThese are just my 2c.

came in discussion over Slack and resurfaced in #222\r\nI would be in favor of renaming the `method` kwarg in `Scattering3D` to something more descriptive, like `sampling`.\r\nBelow is a discussion I've have with @eickenberg 3 weeks ago on the topic. You will see that, at first, I'm in favor of the term `averaging`, and then I change my mind to `sampling`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> I would be in favor of renaming the `method` kward in scattering3d, into `averaging`\r\n> so that `standard`, `integral`, and `local`\r\n> would rename to\r\n> `local`, `global`, and `foveal` respectively\r\n> this distinction is also very useful in 1d and 2d, so it could be added in the future without API break\r\n> `points` could be renamed to `foveal_coords` for clarity but that’s a small change that does not require a cross-module deprecation (edited)\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael [21 days ago]\r\nI agree with all of that except the word foveal - not sure that is the right term, but maybe I also don't completely understand the concept\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> this is something on which @Mathieu has more expertise, but it’s basically the scattering transform \r\n> of x(t) computed only at t=0 (or at a small, finite number of points) rather than at every t\r\n> so that spares the convolution with phi for going from U to S, which considerably speeds up the code\r\n> this is super useful in time series forecasting. also when you don’t need invariance to translation because the object is already registered around a natural “center” for you.\r\n> see paper by Chang, Mallat, and Yap in Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis. It’s brilliant \r\n> `foveated` might be preferable over `foveal`. `foveated` is computer vision terminology whereas `foveal` relates more to anatomy\r\n\r\nMichael [21 days ago]\r\nOh yeah I know that paper -- I just didn't see a connection to the 3d option of evaluation in specific points, since these need not be foveal points\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> why not? aren’t they foveal points by virtue of being “specific” (i.e. user-defined)?\r\n\r\nMichael [21 days ago]\r\nTo me a fovea is a point of concentration of measurements, not just a specific choice of measurements\r\ngiven a certain budget of measurements but which you get to apply anywhere, for some signals and tasks it is beneficial to concentrate them\r\ne.g. https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/11/09/learn-to-attend-fovea/\r\nThe Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Blog\r\nThe Emergence of a Fovea while Learning to Attend\r\nThe BAIR Blog (135 kB)\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> ok, so that is necessarily an adaptive thing?\r\n> hm\r\n\r\nMichael [21 days ago]\r\nnot adaptive necessarily, but concentrating measurements\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> perhaps `averaging=None` would make the most sense then? (edited)\r\n> well no because that could imply that we return the whole `U` for every `t`, not just near one point `t=0` \r\n\r\nMichael [21 days ago]\r\ni.e. specifying a regular grid of measurements is not foveating, and one can do that in the 3d case. so i don't think it's about foveating but rather just evaluating wherever one wants\r\nbut again, I don't even understand what this was implemented for. If it was implemented with foveation in mind, then maybe it's legit to call it that\r\nSo I would definitely like to see an `averaging=None` option for returning U, but the evaluation in specific points thing seems to be different from that\r\n\r\n> lostanlen [21 days ago]\r\n> right.\r\n> ... and I thought `averaging='foveal'` was clever :/\r\n> I have an idea.
