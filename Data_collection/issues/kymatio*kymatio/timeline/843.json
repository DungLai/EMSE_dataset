(but does not fully fix)  #852 \r\n\r\nThird PR in a streak (after #860 and #861), attempting to simplify core 1D scattering and decouple its functionalities.\r\nThis time the offender is `out_type` and the post-processing that comes after the scattering transform per se.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that there isn't much of a reason to write a backend-agnostic implementation of this formatting stage, considering that it's already divided into `\"array\"`, `\"dict\"` and `\"list\"` cases.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR brings us closer than we've ever been to a `Scattering1D` generator, which would `yield` coefficients instead of `return`-ing them. Hence a _big_ simplification in scope once we're able to decouple `scattering1d` from padding, averaging, and unpadding routines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6793077836,"node_id":"CE_lADOCQLq_c5LLEvpzwAAAAGU5iRM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6793077836","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-13T05:29:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
