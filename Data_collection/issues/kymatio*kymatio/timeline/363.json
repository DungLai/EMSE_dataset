the padding works by finding the smallest size larger than ceil(M+2^J) but divisible by 2^J. There are indeed two issues:\r\n\r\n1. pytorch padding doesn't handle settings for which one of the padding top/down+right/left is larger than the image size. This could be easily fixed, yet I think this is not critical because...\r\n2. the settings in which J=(log(N)/log(2)) corresponds typically to settings where one does try to compute the expected scattering of a signal. For natural images, there are quite lot of boundary effects, but this is not the typical setting in which one does compute the e.s.. Thus, I simply padded by M meaning that the final size will be 2^(J+1). Alson I think this is consistant with the fact that there: *phi=\\int ..

to reopen this, and feel free to close if I'm wrong, but I believe this still doesn't work on master as of now.\r\n```python\r\nfrom kymatio import Scattering2D\r\nimport torch\r\nJ = 5\r\nN = 32\r\nscattering = Scattering2D(J, shape=(N, N))\r\nx = torch.zeros(3, 3, N, N)\r\nprint(scattering(x).shape)\r\n```\r\nwhich prints `torch.Size([3, 3, 681, 0, 0])` but I believe the correct result should be `torch.Size([3, 3, 681, 1, 1])`. Whatever the intended result, the test for this is actually disabled: the scattering is never called in \r\nhttps://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/kymatio/scattering2d/tests/test_scattering2d.py#L368, and even if called the output shape should be tested in my opionion (this is also valid for the case `N+5` below).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm doing the right thing, but I fixed it by making the following changes:\r\n- remove the special cases for `M == 2 ** J` and `N == 2** J` in `compute_padding` (https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/kymatio/scattering2d/utils.py#L23) : without the special case, `M_padded = 3 * M` and it is now `M_padded = 2 * M`. I believe the correct behaviour is to pad by `M` on each size, thus yielding a final size of `M_padded = 3 * M`,\r\n- make a copy of `self.pad_size` in `Pad` (https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/kymatio/scattering2d/backend/backend_torch.py#L40), because the following lines modify in place `self.pad_size`, which cause the condition `self.pad_size == self.input_size` to fail in `self.__call__`.\r\n\r\nI can make a PR if this is indeed the correct

addition to what I discussed in https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/363#issuecomment-513037055, I fixed a bug for the case `M != N`, because pytorch expects its padding sizes in the reverse order.\r\n\r\nHopefully fixes #363 for real.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2500191302,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUwMDE5MTMwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2500191302","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-22T15:11:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"MatthijsMars","id":32309817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzA5ODE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32309817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthijsMars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthijsMars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T10:48:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T10:48:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/792","id":1112476425,"node_id":"I_kwDOCQLq_c5CTwsJ","number":792,"title":"Scattering
