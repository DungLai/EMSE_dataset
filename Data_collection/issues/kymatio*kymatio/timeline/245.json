yes, `Q` could use a default. So that\r\n`S = ScatteringXd(J, shape=(8,)*X`)\r\nworks for `X=1`, `X=2`, `X=3`.\r\n\r\n(ultimately, even the `shape` coud disappear, but that's another story)\r\n\r\nHowever, I am a little bit concerned about setting `Q=8` by default. I know that this is a popular choice and leads to state of the art results in speech, but there are many other applications that require a different `Q`. Some applications in music require `Q=12`, `Q=16`, `Q=24`. In bioacoustics, I use `Q=50`. In EEG analysis, I use `Q=2`. So it's important that the user should be aware of the need to set up `Q` according to the time-frequency localization properties of the underlying signal.\r\n\r\nBy that token, the only acceptable default value I can see for `Q` is `Q=1`, because that is consistent with 2D and 3D. If `Q` ever makes it to 2D and 3D, it's very clear that `Q=1` will be the default value in these dimensions. The theory of 1D wavelets and 1D scattering is also most developed in the `Q=1` case, and extended to other quality factors as a separate generalization, almost as an afterthought.\r\n\r\nThis issue seems trivial (because the amount of code required to solve it is very short) but it's actually very important in my opinion, as it clearly sets a direction in the way we want to steer our user base. It comes down to this: among the three complaints below, which one are the least eager to reply to?\r\n(1) \"help: how to reproduce the experiments on TIMIT?\" (answer: set `Q=8`)\r\n(2) \"help: why am I getting more coefficients in 1D than in 2D if 1D does not have orientations?\" (answer: `set Q=1`)\r\n(3) \"help: Scattering1D gives a runtime error: Q required. What even is Q?\" (answer: it's explained in the docs)\r\n\r\nChoosing to set `Q=1` by default leads to user complaints of type (1)\r\nChoosing to set `Q=8` by default leads to user complains ot type (2)\r\nChoosing to not set `Q` (status quo) leads to user complaints of type (3)\r\n\r\nThere is no free lunch in API design
