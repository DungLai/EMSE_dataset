@flyIchtus ,\r\n\r\nRight now, what you're doing is indeed the only way to have custom padding/unpadding in Kymatio 2D: pass `pre_pad=False` and roll up your own implementation, `order2_ind` in your case.\r\n\r\nBut i agree that this is not satisfactory and ideally you should be able to pass a single keyword argument at runtime. Not:\r\n```python\r\nscattering=Scattering2D(4,data.shape,8, pad_type=pad_type)\r\nresults_order2=scattering(data)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscattering=Scattering2D(4,data.shape,8)\r\nresults_order2=scattering(data, pad_type=pad_type)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n(the keyword `pad_type` is up for debate. It's not a \"type\" in the CS sense of the word)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the `Scattering2D` object shouldn't need to know about what type of padding you'll want to apply later. From a user's perspective, this will allow you to have a single object computing scattering transforms with several kinds of padding. When that plan is ready, all your code will rewrite as\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscattering = Scattering2D(J=4, shape=data.shape, L=8)\r\nS2_symm = scattering(data, pad_type='symmetric')\r\nS2_reflect = scattering(data, pad_type='reflect')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1151944530/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6782954950,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGUS63G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6782954950","actor":{"login":"flyIchtus","id":95094184,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasFqA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95094184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus","html_url":"https://github.com/flyIchtus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T05:03:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6782954953,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGUS63J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6782954953","actor":{"login":"flyIchtus","id":95094184,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasFqA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95094184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus","html_url":"https://github.com/flyIchtus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T05:03:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-14T15:50:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T15:50:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/879","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/879/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/879/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/879/events","htm

sorry for the long delay. Thank you both for pointing me to useful discussions.\r\n\r\nGreat proposal @lostanlen , having flexible padding options for the same scattering object really more elegant (and lean).\r\nLooking at #727, the main issue for implementation seems to be the diversity of backends.\r\n\r\nAgree that pad_mode seems better than pad_type.\r\n\r\nAs for validation and correctness issue @MuawizChaudhary  : \r\n\r\nA starting point could be something like https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02178\r\nand showing what bias the different padding modes introduce, especially on intermediate activations (my modest plot upwards was a push in this direction). \r\n\r\nHoping for \"perfect\" 2D padding, that would allow to forget boundary effects, seems unreasonable however. \r\n\r\nAnyway, on texture datasets, it would be interesting to (statistically) compare\r\n\r\n-  the effect of (M,N)-padding on (H,W) images\r\n-  the effect of no padding on (H+M, W+N) images\r\n\r\nI might be able to have a try on my weather dataset (which, strictly speaking, is not a texture but incorporate some). I keep you updated on this issue 1) if you are interested and 2) if i can get it done in the coming weeks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1161952726/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flyIchtus","id":95094184,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasFqA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95094184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus","html_url":"https://github.com/flyIchtus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyIchtus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6848786195,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGYOC8T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6848786195","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-21T16:00:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6848786207,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGYOC8f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6848786207","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-21T16:00:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6848786220,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGYOC8s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6848786220","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-21T16:00:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6848786225,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5LeaatzwAAAAGYOC8x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6848786225","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id
