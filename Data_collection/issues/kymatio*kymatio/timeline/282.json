This figure was done with the MATLAB library ScatNet. Although the development of ScatNet has now been discontinued, you can still use it if all you need is the visualization.\r\nThat said, I will personally add that I don't find subfigure (d) particularly intuitive or helpful to understand scattering transform. Various second-order orientations (theta_2) and second-order scales (j2) are arranged within small angular sections of the circle, if they happen to have the same theta1 and j1. This arrangement does not reflect the contiguity in theta_2 nor j_2. At the end of the day, displaying seond-order coefficients while respecting contiguity cannot be done in dimension 2. There needs to be a projection somewhere.\r\nTherefore, I don't see the implementaion of this mode of visualization as a priority in Kymatio. But perhaps other Kymationauts will think otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/451750295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/451750631","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/282#issuecomment-451750631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/282","id":451750631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTc1MDYzMQ==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-06T15:34:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-06T15:34:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi Jonas, Vincent,\r\nI agree with Vincent that the priority is not to develop this feature and that this type of visualization has to intrinsic issues, however, I'm not against adding it in a future release.

sounds good, do keep us posted about that! I would advise to make a separate repository for this visualization. Although it's true that Kymatio 0.1-beta does not output coefficients in a structured way but in a \"raveled\" (1D) way, it should be relatively easy for you to reverse-engineer that raveling process, and come up with a (theta1, j1, theta2, j2) tuple for every index in the feature vector. Once you've done that, you can use matplotlib to make the polar plot in the fashion of the Bruna and Mallat paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/455634053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2083564023,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA4MzU2NDAyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2083564023","actor":{"login":"Jonas1312","id":15847892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15847892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312","html_url":"https://github.com/Jonas1312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T17:58:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2083564025,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwODM1NjQwMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/2083564025","actor":{"login":"Jonas1312","id":15847892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15847892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312","html_url":"https://github.com/Jonas1312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T17:58:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/455765669","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/282#issuecomment-455765669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/282","id":455765669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTc2NTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"Jonas1312","id":15847892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15847892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312","html_url":"https://github.com/Jonas1312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonas1312/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-19T09:52:00Z","updated_at":"2019-01-19T09:53:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lostanlen
