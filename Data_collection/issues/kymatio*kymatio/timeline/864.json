I'm looking for the total number of non-optimizable parameters. For example, if the first-order coefficients are given by S_1 = | x * \\Psi_(\\lambda_1) | * \\Phi_J, I'm interested in the sum of the number of elements of each \\Psi filter and each \\Phi_J filter (not the \"scattering output\", S_1). Is there any direct way to get each wavelet that composes the transform in the time domain?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/1151953325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"evertoneie","id":58944849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTQ0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58944849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie","html_url":"https://github.com/evertoneie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertoneie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6783010695,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5LhPhbzwAAAAGUTIeH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6783010695","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T05:18:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6783010698,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5LhPhbzwAAAAGUTIeK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6783010698","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T05:18:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6783010702,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCQLq_c5LhPhbzwAAAAGUTIeO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6783010702","actor":{"login":"MuawizChaudhary","id":39755015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39755015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/MuawizChaudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuawizChaudhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T05:18:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6783010706,"node_id":"SE_lADOCQLq_c5LhPhbzwAAAAGUTIeS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/6783010706","actor":{"log

 I believe that you should be able to take the 1d IFFT of the filter to get the time domain representation. Please note that the imaginary part might be zero i.e. the filter might be real. \r\n\r\nTake each filter, take its ifft. take product of the shape, and add to total.Tho, the ifft should not change the shape i dont believe.
