of https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/893 except geared at main branch\r\n\r\nContinuation of the Scattering1D simplification/decoupling streak: #871, #877, #879, #880.\r\n\r\nThe `DryBackend()` is now in full swing:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        class DryBackend:\r\n            __getattr__ = lambda self, attr: (lambda *args: None)\r\n\r\n        S = scattering1d(None, DryBackend(),

`scattering_filter_factory` to get self.meta() !\r\nAnd no more mimicry of depth-first search in a `utils.py` function. We're now relying on core scattering to perform the depth-first search.\r\n\r\nThis remains backwards compatible so could be merged for v0.3. The role of this PR was to offer a proof of feasability towards automatic meta in JTFS\r\n\r\nCloses #856 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe crux of the PR is here:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nS = scattering1d(None, DryBackend(), self.psi1_f, self.psi2_f,\r\n    self.phi_f, self.oversampling, self.max_order)\r\nS = sorted(list(S), key=lambda path: (len(path['n']), path['n']))\r\nmeta = dict(order=np.array([len(path['n']) for path in S]))\r\n\r\nmeta['key'] = [path['n'] for path in S]\r\nmeta['n'] = np.stack([np.append(\r\n    path['n'], (np.nan,)*(self.max_order-len(path['n']))) for path in S])\r\n    \r\nfilterbanks = (self.psi1_f, self.psi2_f)[:self.max_order]\r\n\r\nfor key in ['xi', 'sigma', 'j']:\r\n    meta[key] = meta['n'] * np.nan\r\n\r\n    for order, filterbank in enumerate(filterbanks):\r\n        for n, psi in enumerate(filterbank):\r\n            meta[key][meta['n'][:, order]==n, order] = psi[key]\r\n            \r\nreturn meta\r\n ```\r\n\r\nI have moved the legacy implementation (`compute_meta_scattering`) to the test suite so that we can verify backwards compatibility.

#851\r\n\r\nalso closes #916 \r\n\r\nNew prototype for `scattering_filter_factory`\r\n```python\r\nscattering_filter_factory(N, J, Q, T, filterbank)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere filterbank is stored as a property of the scattering object.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe algorithm for scattering filter factory is now way more concise. No more `if` statements !\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Loop over scattering layers\r\nfor Q_layer in Q:\r\n    psi_f = []\r\n\r\n    # Loop over center frequencies xi and bandwidths sigma in the filterbank\r\n    for xi, sigma in filterbank_fn(J, Q_layer, **filterbank_kwargs):\r\n\r\n        # Construct filter at full resolution\r\n        psi_levels = [morlet_1d(N, xi, sigma)]\r\n        j = get_max_dyadic_subsampling(xi, sigma, **filterbank_kwargs)\r\n\r\n        # Resample to smaller resolutions if necessary (beyond 1st layer)\r\n        # The idiom min(previous_J, j, log2_T) implements \"j1 < j2\"\r\n        for level in range(1, min(previous_J, j, log2_T)):\r\n            psi_level = psi_levels[0].reshape(2 ** level, -1).mean(axis=0)\r\n            psi_levels.append(psi_level)\r\n        psi_f.append({'levels': psi_levels, 'xi': xi, 'sigma': sigma, 'j': j})\r\n        max_j = max(j, max_j)\r\n\r\n    # Keep score of how many resolutions will be needed in the next layer\r\n    previous_J = max_j\r\n    psis_f.append(psi_f)\r\n\r\n# Same with low-pass filter phi\r\nsigma_low = filterbank_kwargs[\"sigma0\"] / T\r\nphi_levels = [gauss_1d(N, sigma_low)]\r\nfor level in range(1, max(previous_J, 1+log2_T)):\r\n    phi_level = phi_levels[0].reshape(2 ** level, -1).mean(axis=0)\r\n    phi_levels.append(phi_level)\r\nphi_f = {'levels': phi_levels, 'xi': 0, 'sigma': sigma_low, 'j': log2_T}\r\n\r\nreturn tuple([phi_f] + psis_f)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] write `scatnet_generator`\r\n- [x] update callsites: `scattering_filter_factory`, `precompute_size_scattering`, `compute_meta_scattering`\r\n- [x] define `generators` and `filters` lists\r\n- [x] pass `alpha` as `filterbank_kwargs`\r\n- [x] pass `sigma0` as `generator_kwargs`\r\n- [x] pass `r_psi` as `generator_kwargs`\r\n- [x] refactor `scattering_filter_factory` for any order\r\n- [x] merge #914 (automatic meta and output_size)\r\n- [x] resolve conflicts here \r\n- [x] documentation\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [x] examples\r\n\r\nSome of the new features that will become easier to develop and maintain after this:\r\n\r\nspinned wavelets\r\nvarying J per order\r\nswitching wavelet types\r\nvarying r_psi per order\r\nvarying wavelet type per order\r\nhaving more than two orders\r\nreplacing the scatnet_generator by something else\r\n\r\nNB: \"skip filters\" is out of scope for this PR. This is more simply done with a `DryBackend` (#914)\r\nNB: in the end i didn't introduce `wavelet` and `lowpass` properties, only `filterbank`. I don't want to introduce too many features that perhaps no one will use (although there is precedent for a feature request in switching the wavelet: #385 , but one thing at a time)\r\n\r\nI have removed `periodize_filter_fourier` which is a simple one-liner and was called in 2/3 places\r\n`compute_params_filterbank` is now replaced by `scatnet_generator`, which is shorter. I have also improved (i hope!) the documentation\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
