other words, make `Scattering*D` operators act only on last dimension without forcing a specific convention on previous dimensions. The output would have the same shape, but this the time/spatial dimension subsampled and another (scattering) dimension added right before it. So we'd have\r\n\r\n- in 1D, `batch_shape + (T,)` input gives `batch_shape + (C, T/2**J)` output, and\r\n- in 2D, `batch_shape + (N, M)` input gives `batch_shape + (C, N/2**J, M/2**J)` output,\r\n\r\nwhere `batch_shape` is some (possibly empty) tuple specifying the batch dimensions that are not to be processed and `C` is the number of scattering coefficients.\r\n\r\nThe 3D case is more complicated since it follows a different output schema compared to the 1D and 2D, which will be addressed in a separate issue. That being said, it would be good if it could mimic the above behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
