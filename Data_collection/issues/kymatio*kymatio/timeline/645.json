And the answer is not that obvious. You'll need to cover indeed negative frequencies. I feel your question is more related to 1d-signals, and I'll et @lostanlen or @janden speak up, yet in term of 2D, this is not native:\r\n\r\n1. The 2D low-pass filter. It's likely that then we will be willing to use a modulus there in order to output real-valued scattering coefficients here. Yet in vision, modulus are not desirable.\r\n2. Currently, the WT is exploiting the hermitian symmetry, meaning that we would lack half of the wavelet coefficients if we were using complex signals. This should be an easy fix.\r\n3. In roto-translation (which is close to 3D), implemented like in https://github.com/scatnet/scatnet , the current WT is not correct (except if a fix has been added). The maison reason is that the composition of two analytic WTs (one along space, one along angles) isn't analytic. You need at least one of them to cover the full spectrum and it can be simply viewed as follow: one 2D analytic WT combined with an analytic angular WT covers only 1/4th of the spectral space. I suspect that this might affect positively many benchmarks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/764435816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4231880623,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIzMTg4MDYyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4231880623","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-21T07:15:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4231880627,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMzE4ODA2Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4231880627","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-21T07:15:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4231880629,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIzMTg4MDYyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4231880629","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYwNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden","html_url":"https://github.com/janden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-21T07:15:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4231880631,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMzE4ODA2MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4231880631","actor":{"login":"janden","id":3976052,"node

@buffy-nevc,\r\n\r\nThis is a good feature request indeed.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about the issue (in 1-D) and it seems relatively straightforward, although i haven't tried it.\r\nWith Morlet wavelets (the default), i think it would be sufficient to compute the scattering coefficients of both x and x.conj(), and concatenate the result. Here's why.\r\n\r\nNote that the conjugation is distributive over the convolution:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(x' * psi) = (x'' * psi')' = (x * psi')'\r\n```\r\n(where the prime symbol `'` and the asterisk symbol `*` denote conjugation and convolution respectively)\r\n\r\nTherefore, by applying the complex modulus\r\n```\r\n|x' * psi| = |x * psi'|\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, observe that conjugating the filter in the time domain (`psi'(t)`) is tantamount to conjugating and flipping in the Fourier domain. \r\nIn the case of a Morlet wavelet `psi` (the default), the wavelet has a symmetric profile in the Fourier domain, and is thus real in the Fourier domain. Therefore, conjugation has no effect in the Fourier domain, and conjugating `psi` in the time domain is tantamount to flipping in the Fourier domain. (in other words, we may neglect the effect of conjugation on a real input)\r\n\r\nThe takeaway from this line of reasoning (if i'm correct) is that we don't need to design new filters. It suffices to conjugate the input as a pre-processing stage. This means that the same `Scattering1D` object may accommodate real or complex inputs at `forward` time. (unless there's a strong assumption that x must be real in the forward? which we could relax)\r\n\r\nHowever, we'd have to rewrite the `backward` stage in part because we'd have to remove the real-to-complex conversion in `Scattering1D`. So perhaps this warrants creating a new class `Scattering1DComplex` to address this problem. `Scattering1DComplex` could rely on `Scattering1D.forward` for the forward stage. \r\n\r\nAlso note that what i'm proposing only works with Morlet wavelets. It wouldn't work with asymmetric wavelets (e.g., Gammatones), but since they are not implemented in Kymatio, i would be in favor of not getting ahead of ourselves and doing it this way, which is simpler than designing new filters and rewriting the forward pass.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/770672525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4272217076,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI3MjIxNzA3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4272217076","actor":{"login":"Buffy-nevc","id":77767389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77767389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc","html_url":"https://github.com/Buffy-nevc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-01T08:30:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4272217081,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNzIyMTcwODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4272217081","actor":{"login":"Buffy-nevc","id":77767389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77767389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc","html_url":"https://github.com/Buffy-nevc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-01T08:30:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/772107361","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/645#issuecomment-772107361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/645","id":772107361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjEwNzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"Buffy-nevc","id":77767389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77767389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc","html_url":"https://github.com/Buffy-nevc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T00:18:53Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T00:18:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi edouardoyallon and lostanlen,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for you reply. I think I understand the idea now.\r\n\r\nI agree with lostanlen's idea in principle. For complex signals, we can calculate scattering wavelet transform on x and x' separately and concatenate the results at each individual layer.  And my understanding is that this idea does not work when we try to re-synthesis the signal back from its scattering wavelet coefficients due to current library internal function limitation. \r\n\r\nI am going to go away and try it out on different class of signals and will let you know how I go. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nBuffy\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/772107361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Buffy-nevc","id":77767389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77767389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc","html_url":"https://github.com/Buffy-nevc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buffy-nevc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/772310844","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/645#issuecomment-772310844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/645","id":772310844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjMxMDg0NA==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T07:54:25Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T07:54:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@lostanlen So, complex numbers will be soon native, because they're native (I think) in all our frameworks.

@edouardoyallon it's less a problem of native/non-native complex numbers than about making sure that we cover the \"negative frequency range\" [pi, 2*pi[ in the first layer. So we definitely need to write more code, no matter what. The question is more, how much of the present code can we re-use? (hopefully most of it)\r\n\r\nAs I said above the code to write is trivial - what is non trivial is the mechanism to ensure someone will not compute a real WT on a complex signal or the opposite, and that what I think is difficult and to know if one should need |x|\\star\\phi or x\\star\\phi, both being .. natural in this context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/772373129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4284205375,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI4NDIwNTM3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4284205375","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-03T09:41:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4284205382,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyODQyMDUzODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4284205382","actor":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-03T09:41:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-13T14:27:11Z","updated_at":"2022-08-13T14:27:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/922/labels
