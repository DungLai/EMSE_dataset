You are right in that joint time--frequency scattering (JTFS) is not supported by Kymatio in its current version. The only available implementations are in MATLAB: ScatNet or my implementation (scattering.m) https://github.com/lostanlen/scattering.m\r\n\r\nHowever, as @eickenberg notes, JTFS is not as simple as stacking a layer of Scattering2D on top of a layer of Scattering1D. The 2-D filtering in JTFS should be applied to the un-averaged output of Scattering1D, noted as U1 in the research papers. This unaveraged output is multirate, and thus cannot be used as an input of Scattering2D. Instead, what is necessary is to apply 1-D filtering in time (just like in second-order time scattering) and then immediately apply 1-D filtering in frequency.\r\n\r\nThis means that it is needed to:\r\n* design a custom filter bank for the frequency domain\r\n* rewrite the depth-first search so that j2 appears in the *outer* loop, not the inner loop\r\n* concatenate paths which share a common j2 along the j1 axis\r\n* take care of the edge case where the frequency filter is a low-pass (phi) whereas the time filter is a band-pass (psi)\r\n* implement spatiotemporal low-pass filtering at the end to ensure invariance to frequency transposition\r\n\r\nI have short-term plans to use more JTFS in research so i'd like to captain this effort. It's far from obvious, but it's within reach. However, given the scale of the task, i think it's prematurate to envision merging this to Kymatio as soon as it's ready. I imagine that other admins (@eickenberg et al.) will prefer to see this code develop in a separate repository for the moment. Once we're satisfied with the tool, we may consider including it as part of the \"standard library\" of Kymatio. (and you all can be sure that i'll be ðŸ¥³ -ing that day!)\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/789723958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lostanlen","id":3943142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDMxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen","html_url":"https://github.com/lostanlen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lostanlen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4402093566,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQwMjA5MzU2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4402093566","actor":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-03T13:44:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4402093573,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MDIwOTM1NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4402093573","actor":{"login":"eickenberg","id":1306635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/eickenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eickenberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-03T13:44:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4402093582,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQwMjA5MzU4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/events/4402093582","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-03T13:44:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4402093585,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MDIwOTM1ODU=","

(Basically since we only do first-order and no downsampling, we do a simple matrix multiply followed by `ifft`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/790055966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OverLordGoldDragon","id":16495490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16495490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/OverLordGoldDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OverLordGoldDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/comments/790056967","html_url":"https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/672#issuecomment-790056967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kymatio/kymatio/issues/672","id":790056967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDA1Njk2Nw==","user":{"login":"edouardoyallon","id":4263222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjMyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon","html_url":"https://github.com/edouardoyallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edouardoyallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T21:10:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T21:10:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@OverLordGoldDragon maybe you could try to PR your code in ours, if the speedup is significant?
