PR is related to JTFS. Here's my rationale:\n* i'd like to avoid having to write a `jtfs_filter_factory`\n* rather, i'd like to call `scattering_filter_factory` twice: once for the temporal filters and again (with different arguments) for the frequential filters\n* but i don't want to have to assume that the input  of the frequential scattering has a power-of-two support. That would require a lot of padding (up to ~JQ zeros, i.e. >100) and thus woul hurt speed and memory usage. Rather i'd like to pad to a non-power-of-two multiple of 2**log2_F (aka the frequential \"stride\" )\n* yet `scattering_filter_factory` currently takes `J_pad` (the log2 of the padded support) as input. Since J_pad must be integer, it follows that the padded input must be a power of two in length.\n* so i will propose (in a separate PR) that `scattering_filter_factory` should take N_padded, not J_pad, as input.\n* that future PR will improve consistency with Scattering2D, whose `scattering_filter_factory` requires takes `N_padded`, not its log2, as input.\n* besides JTFS, that future PR will also benefit 1D (aka \"plain time scattering\") because it will speed up the code (smaller input) and reduce memory usage (better data/padding ratio).\n* of course this PR will require its own test suite and careful review\n* but for now, i think it is clear that J_pad is not necessary to instantiate the 1D scattering filter factory, so i propose to do it now (in 0.3) with the plan of removing it in 0.4.\n* The removal will be justified by a concern of \"principle of minimum surprise\" between time scattering parameters (N,J,Q,T) and frequency scattering (N_fr, J_fr, Q_fr, T_fr). There won't be an integer named J_pad_fr\n* in conclusion, i believe that this deprecation / API change is a reasonable price to pay in front of improved consistency and flexibility\n\n@eickenberg i hope this
