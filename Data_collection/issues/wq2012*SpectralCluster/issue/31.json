Thank you so much for the repo.  I would like to use spectral clustering to accomplish the following:\r\n\r\n1)  Take a 1 hour audio\r\n2) Take the first N min of audio and create an initial cluster\r\n3)  I would then like to take the rest of the audio, segment it in some way, and push those audio segments through the initial cluster to see which speaker created in the initial cluster it is most similar to (or just return the speaker label it is closest to)\r\n\r\n(Please let me know if this isn't clear)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to accomplish this using SpectralCluster?  Create an initial cluster based on some fixed length audio and use that cluster model to predict other audio segments? \r\n\r\nIs there some parameter here:\r\n\r\nclusterer = SpectralClusterer(\r\n    min_clusters=2,\r\n    max_clusters=7,\r\n    autotune=None,\r\n    laplacian_type=None,\r\n    refinement_options=None,\r\n    custom_dist=\"cosine\")\r\n\r\nthat can be set to accomplish this before running cluster.predict()?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the reply.","closed_by":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
