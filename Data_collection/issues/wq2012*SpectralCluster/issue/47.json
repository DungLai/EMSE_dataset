And found it works well for the two speaker conversations. However, when the real speaker number greater than 2, the cluster still predict with 2 speaker even I set the max_clusters as 7. I also tried with some different settings but it failed to predict the speaker number at most time. While the AHC is to sensetive with the distance hreshold and predicted more speaker than the real condition. I was wondering which paramter should I tune to make the scp_clusterer more sensetive with the speakr number? Thanks a lot.\r\n```\r\nscp_clusterer = SpectralClusterer(\r\n        min_clusters=2,\r\n        max_clusters=7,\r\n        autotune=None,\r\n        laplacian_type=None,\r\n        refinement_options=None,\r\n        custom_dist=\"cosine\")\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
