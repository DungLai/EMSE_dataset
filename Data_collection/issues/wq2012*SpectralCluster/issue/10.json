However, i've never seen any experiment with x-Vector. \r\nHave you ever done it? If yes, is x-Vector + Spectral Cluster  better than i-Vector + Spectral Cluster?\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
