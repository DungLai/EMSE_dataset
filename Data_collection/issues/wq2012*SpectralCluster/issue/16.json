Seeing as forced alignment given audio and its corresponding text, outputs the the time intervals of speech in the stream, is that not sufficient enough? Or is it not due to the fact that it must be applied to each audio file prior to training and inference, whereas with GMM construction it is only performed once.","closed_by":{"login":"kareemamrr","id":26971543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTcxNTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26971543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr","html_url":"https://github.com/kareemamrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareemamrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
