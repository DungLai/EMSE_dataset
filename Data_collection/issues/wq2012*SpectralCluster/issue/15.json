Also, a single embedding is representative of 240ms of the original signal overlapping by 120ms. So two full embeddings would be representative of 360ms of the original signal, whatabout the remaining 40ms? In this [issue](https://github.com/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/3) one of the author states that a segment has about 4 windows but I couldn't understand how that is achieved.","closed_by":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
