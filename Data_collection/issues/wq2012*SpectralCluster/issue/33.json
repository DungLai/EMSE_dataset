I am wondering whether it would change previous step prediction?  \r\n    e.g. we have (segment_id,prediction) (1,A),(2,B),...,(N,M), then new turn segment N+1 comes, and make clustering & prediction, will it change  previous segments's prediction, such as -> (1,B),(2,A),...,(N,C),(N+1,M).     \r\n\r\n> To have both great performance and low latency at the same time, we use spectral clustering in an online fashion: every time when we have a new speaker embedding, we run spectral clustering on the entire sequence of all existing embeddings.\r\n\r\n2. how about the performance and robustness of this method in real-scenario call center or on-device ?  and also I am confused about how is the inbound call center dataset with 2-10 speakers generated, I cannot image why initiated by customer would have speakers more than 2/3 to 10 ? maybe the conference scenario?     \r\n> The“Inbound” subset, which includes 250 conversations initiated by customers. This dataset has approximately 22 hours of speech in total. Each utterance has 2 to 10 speakers.
