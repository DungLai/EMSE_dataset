am currently playing with `SpectralCluster` inside `pyannote.audio`.\r\n \r\nIt looks like `SpectralClusterer._compute_eigenvectors_ncluster` is having trouble when there is just one speaker (`n_clusters` = 1). \r\n\r\nDespite setting `min_clusters` to 1, it (always?) tends to return at least 2 clusters.\r\n\r\nI understand that applying clustering on cases where `n_clusters = 1` is not really useful but I think that is definitely a good use case for `auto-tune`.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on how to solve this issue?\r\nI could add a postprocessing when the estimated `n_clusters` is 2 and simply compare both centroids with a simple threshold but maybe there is something obvious I missed in `SpectralCluster`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
