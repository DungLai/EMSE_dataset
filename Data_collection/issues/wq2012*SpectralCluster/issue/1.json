I've been working in face recognition and person re-identification domain for a while and I think your clustering method is useful for these domain for sure.\r\n\r\nI've also read your recent papers, especially the one \"LINKS: A HIGH-DIMENSIONAL ONLINE CLUSTERING METHOD\". However, I got a bit confused when looking through this repo. I'm just wondering how can we benefit from your algorithm(this repo) to do online clustering? Because I didn't see such process in the demo code. Or, is LINKS a totally different algorithm? \r\n\r\nAnyway, could you please give me some more explanation about your online clustering method mentioned in your paper?
