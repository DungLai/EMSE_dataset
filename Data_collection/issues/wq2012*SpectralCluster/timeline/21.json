But our numerical simulations based on a large number of randomly generated data have shown that our matrix (new diagonal is the maximal non-diagonal element in each row) have similar properties to a standard Laplacian matrix.\r\n\r\n**The number of connected components in the graph equals to the number of eigenvalues that are significantly larger than 0.**\r\n\r\nBesides, our matrix is more robust to Gaussian blurring. That's the reason we use this non-standard Laplacian.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/739984159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4109729989,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDEwOTcyOTk4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/events/4109729989","actor":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-14T15:05:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
