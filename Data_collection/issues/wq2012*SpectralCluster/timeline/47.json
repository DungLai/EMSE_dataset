I tried the turntodiarize cluster in the configs. I noticed it need a constrain matirx computed by turn score vector while doing predict. However I do not have that score. Instead I computed the distance matirx of the embddings and  set the CL and ML according to the distance.  But I still just get 2 speaker as result. If I use the distance matrix direclty I can get multiple speaker, however I found the result does not good. I was wondering how should I get a constrain matirx properly?\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/1286388534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kli017","id":14877573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODc3NTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14877573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017","html_url":"https://github.com/kli017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kli017/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
