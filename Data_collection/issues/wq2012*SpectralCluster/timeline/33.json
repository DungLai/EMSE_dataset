I am wondering whether it would change previous step prediction?\r\n\r\nYes, it will! And this means, every time you cluster, you get the \"best\" clustering results given all the information you have **so far**. But you are still going to **correct** previous clustering results after seeing more information.\r\n\r\nThis is quite common for many streaming applications, e.g. streaming ASR. In such applications, the UI usually allows updating previous words based on partial results.\r\n\r\n> how about the performance and robustness of this method in real-scenario call center or on-device ? and also I am confused about how is the inbound call center dataset with 2-10 speakers generated, I cannot image why initiated by customer would have speakers more than 2/3 to 10 ? maybe the conference scenario?\r\n\r\nInbound means customer calling the center. E.g. the customer calls the general service , then general service asks questions such as user ID, and transfers the customer to local service based on user ID, and local service asks question to identify what is the user's problem, and transfer the customer to the expert for that problem. In this process, there are 4 speakers, the customer, the general service, the local service, and the expert. In many scenarios, there are even more speakers due to many transfers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/950352038/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/950787432","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/33#issuecomment-950787432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/33","id":950787432,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCevars44q91o","user":{"login":"songtaoshi","id":20240391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjQwMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20240391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/songtaoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songtaoshi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T10:45:41Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T10:45:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
