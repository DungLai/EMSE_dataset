This Python library is an attempt to reimplement everything in Python. So there will always be some minor differences. However, we are trying our best to make sure the Python and C++ implementations are as close as possible.\r\n\r\nOther than the implementation differences, the configs of `configs.icassp2018_clusterer` should be the same the the ICASSP 2018 paper.\r\n\r\n> Do I need to use code to config refinement operations and many others, after using the above code, when I want to get the configs in your ICASSP 2018 paper ?\r\n\r\nYou don't. By calling `configs.icassp2018_clusterer`, you immediately get the same config as the ICASSP 2018 paper. No need to specify other parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also want to highlight that this config is only optimized for our own d-vector system. It may not work well for other speaker embedding systems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/1002657887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wq2012","id":3002724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI3MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3002724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wq2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/comments/1002660616","html_url":"https://github.com/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/36#issuecomment-1002660616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wq2012/SpectralCluster/issues/36","id":1002660616,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCevars47w2MI","user":{"login":"chonghaozhang1998","id":62875029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODc1MDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62875029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998","html_url":"https://github.com/chonghaozhang1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chonghaozhang1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T15:53:41Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T15:53:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
