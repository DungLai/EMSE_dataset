That may not be considered part of the verb per se, but when you remake the clause with the current code, the negation is lost.\r\n- Shouldn't the matcher be an attribute of the class (so it doesn't need to be created every time the pipeline gets called)?","closed_by":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
