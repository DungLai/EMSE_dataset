Inside `_convert_clauses_to_text`, it doesn't seem to matter since everything gets converted to text anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat's your idea on this:\r\n\r\nIf the inflection is different from a default value, then:\r\n\r\n- Wrap `\"is\"` as a `doc` object inside `_convert_clauses_to_text`\r\n- Inflect, but also include a warning that this is a hacky workaround.\r\n\r\nElse keep `\"is\"` as a string object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/comments/752978054/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5649881284,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPViBs4uS2eLzwAAAAFQwljE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/events/5649881284","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-21T11:06:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
