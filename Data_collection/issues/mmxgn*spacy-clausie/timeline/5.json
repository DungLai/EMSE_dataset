The main issue is that apart from the first clause the other two are not full sentences and require some transformation so that it would be similar to:\r\n\r\n- The blood warmer is a device.\r\n- The device warms up the extra corporeal blood.\r\n- It returns to patient's body.\r\n\r\nI will take a look. I do not currently plan to work on more features for `claucy` since it's served its purpose for me, you are welcome to submit a pull request if you manage to add this functionality, however!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/comments/757328823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5649880931,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPViBs4upezHzwAAAAFQwldj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/events/5649880931","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-21T11:06:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
