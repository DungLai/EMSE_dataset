You might be right that it's better that way. You can try making a PR with your thoughts.\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't the matcher be an attribute of the class (so it doesn't need to be created every time the pipeline gets called)?\r\n\r\nI think this is left over from when I was working with SpaCy 2.0. I wasn't quite sure how to work with the pattern matcher and I did it in a way that was convenient and did what I want. Again if you have a better way I would be happy to consider a PR on that!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/comments/1100905936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/comments/1242757278","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/16#issuecomment-1242757278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/16","id":1242757278,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPViBs5KEvie","user":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-10T15:49:01Z","updated_at":"2022-09-10T15:49:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing this as inactive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/comments/1242757278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7361101698,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPViBs5H57buzwAAAAG2wX-C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmxgn/spacy-clausie/issues/events/7361101698","actor":{"login":"mmxgn","id":349290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn","html_url":"https://github.com/mmxgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmxgn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-10T15:49:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
