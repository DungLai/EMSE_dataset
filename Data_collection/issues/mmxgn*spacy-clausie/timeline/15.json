Again, this is a library I wrote by replicating the paper because I needed at that time (while doing my PhD), not the code which I've never looked upon (I am very unfamiliar with java). If someone needs to use it with the CC-BY 3.0 License through python, they can try creating their own bindings for Clausie, similar to the one I've done for Minie in MiniePy - which I provide with the same LICENSE as Minie.
