There are 2 ways to go about this.\r\n\r\nThe background object can substract the foreground object, thus the background polygon is like having a chunk ripped out of it.\r\n\r\nThe background object includes the foreground object. But only when the background object is completely surrounding the foreground object.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of object detection, I did both. The former for partial occlusions. The latter for complete surroundings.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
