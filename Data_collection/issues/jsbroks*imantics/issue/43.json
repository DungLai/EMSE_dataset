From a JSON file, I generate binary masks using `cv2.fillPoly` and process them. This results in more masks that are usually next to each other (their pixels touch each other). However, after I generate the annotation segmention (using `[list(map(round, polygon)) for polygon in mask.polygons()]`) and importing the generated JSON to COCO Annotator, I see that these masks do not touch each other. There is a thin space between them. That's why I wonder if in the imantics conversion some pixels are missed. Another possibility is a bug or a different convention in `cv2.fillPoly`. I'll investigate the problem, but any help here is welcome.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any help you can provide.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
