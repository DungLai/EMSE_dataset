I have a suggestion. Is it a good idea to have a `base_dir` argument to the class `Dataset`, so that `Dataset.add(str)` can handle the relative path given by `os.path.join(base_dir, rel_path)`. When load from an external file, the `image_file` paths will be concatenated by the `base_dir` to find the correct path.\r\n\r\nI think this would be useful if one wants to create a self-contained dataset with relative paths.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jsbroks/imantics/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
