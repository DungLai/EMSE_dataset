there are a total of 3 issues above:-\r\n\r\na. Not having a clear idea on how to use library. A small tutorial on how the api is meant to be used would be quite useful, especially a lot of stuff gets happened in index operations.\r\n\r\nb. The id issue as stated above, if one tries to load multiple images from a folder, each image has same id, i.e. 0, which when passed to dataset, gets overwritten. Overwriting seems to me as valid behaviour since each image should have unique id, maybe all is required is to set incremental id in Image.get_images_from_folder method, starting from 0(or 1)\r\n\r\nc. The recursion limit issue. \r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/sk/workspace/datasets/imantics/imantics/annotation.py\", line 193, in index\r\n    self.index(image)\r\n  File \"/home/sk/workspace/datasets/imantics/imantics/annotation.py\", line 193, in index\r\n    self.index(image)\r\n  File \"/home/sk/workspace/datasets/imantics/imantics/annotation.py\", line 193, in index\r\n    self.index(image)\r\n  [Previous line repeated 996 more times]\r\n  File \"/home/sk/workspace/datasets/imantics/imantics/annotation.py\", line 189, in index\r\n    found = annotation_index.get(self.id)\r\nRecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison\r\n\r\nI will look into the recursion issue myself, as its my top priority task, however if you have any quick insights, it would help a lot.

Add a number of Annotations to said image (which are indexed correctly):\r\n`image.add(imantics_annot)`\r\n3. Create dataset and add images to it (either using the constructor or the `add` method):\r\n`ds = imantics.Dataset(\"test\", images=image_array)`\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround:\r\nExplicitly adding the
