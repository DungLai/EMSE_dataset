How can I save the scgen objects and scgen model? I have experienced running scgen 30hrs for three times because jupyter notebook crashed after training and during prediction.\r\n\r\nI tried using pickle module to save the model (hoping that I could just load it again anytime instead or re-running scgen many times) but it doesn't seem to work and reverts an error.
