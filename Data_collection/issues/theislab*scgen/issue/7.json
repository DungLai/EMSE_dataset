Is giving me amazing results! \r\n\r\nHowever, right now I have an issue. The tool takes `batch` and `cell_types` as main labels, then I run this as in your notebook and everything works nicely. However, whenever I try to add a new set of lables as follows:\r\n\r\n`adata_hvg_scGen = adata_hvg.copy()`\r\n`adata_hvg_scGen.obs[\"batch\"] = adata_hvg.obs[\"source\"].tolist()`\r\n`adata_hvg_scGen.obs[\"cell_type\"] = adata_hvg.obs[\"leiden\"].tolist()`\r\n`adata_hvg_scGen.obs[\"location\"] = adata_hvg.obs[\"location\"].tolist()`\r\n`adata_hvg_scGen.obs[\"method\"] = adata_hvg.obs[\"method\"].tolist()`\r\n\r\nthe labels are all jumbled around and they don't correspond in the UMAP. I also noticed that the index is removed from after applying `adata_corrected = scgen.batch_removal(adata_network, adata_hvg_scGen)`\r\n\r\nDo you know how to solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks ","closed_by":{"login":"Naghipourfar","id":16001761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar","html_url":"https://github.com/Naghipourfar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naghipourfar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
