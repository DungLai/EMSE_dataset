However, I receive an error that seems like a package incompatibility: Keras requires TensorFlow 2.2 or higher. After installing TensorFlow 2.2, multiple other issues kept popping up so I reinstalled scgen. I then tried to downgrade only Keras to 2.3.0, which seemed to work and allowed me to run \"import scgen\" without compile errors. Will this still allow full scGen functionality? I am using Windows 10. Thank you!","closed_by":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
