I would like to ask for your advice/opinion about my results.\r\n\r\nI integrated 2 independent scRNA-seq datasets from different studies using Seurat and then performed scGen. On the figure attached below, it appears that the R condition has 2 modes, which makes the prediction somewhere in between those modes. \r\n\r\nI wonder if you could give me advice on how to get a workaround on this, like whether this figure gives an insight that the two datasets are not compatible to be integrated to begin with. Or are there other tools which I can use to investigate this to resolve my prediction inaccuracy? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68268222/98945665-c5f73280-252d-11eb-8667-c1ddd3c8acea.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68268222/98945875-15d5f980-252e-11eb-8461-9fd23ac8095d.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
