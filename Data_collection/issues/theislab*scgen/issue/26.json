I am currently using scGen 1.1.5 with python 3.6 in PyCharm in Windows 10, and when I run scGen, I am finding differences between my results and what is shown in the Jupiter Notebook. I used the same code as from the Notebook as well. Here are the graphs I get when I run the example. Do you know what would cause this? Thank you so much for your help!\r\n\r\nEdit: I realize that because this is a machine learning model so each iteration will not be identical, but after rerunning the example I am still not able to get the same degree of spread in the predicted cells as the example in the Notebook. Thanks!\r\n\r\n![Example graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68613530/91208622-5193bc80-e6bf-11ea-8bd4-71de4da9242f.png)\r\n![All Genes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68613530/91208832-acc5af00-e6bf-11ea-9728-627115f12be8.png)\r\n![ISG15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68613530/91208844-afc09f80-e6bf-11ea-8165-8936c5d69910.png)","closed_by":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
