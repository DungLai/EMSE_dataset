Where would be the fix be made if unnormalized counts are used? model.X or train.X before/after training?\r\n\r\nThere's also the warning of filtering, if that could be addressed too, I think it would make the tutorial much more clearer.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"adamgayoso","id":10859440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU5NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10859440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso","html_url":"https://github.com/adamgayoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
