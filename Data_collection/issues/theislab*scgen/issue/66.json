I recently met an import issue: `cannot import name 'setup_anndata' from 'scvi.data'`\r\n\r\nThe initial script try to import 'setup_anndata' from the `*/scvi/data/__init__.py`.\r\nIt seems that the latest version of scvi-tools have no more 'setup_anndata' in '__init__.py'. It showed error:\r\n`ImportError: cannot import name 'setup_anndata' from 'scvi.data'`\r\n\r\nThe latest version I installed of scvi-tools is '0.15.4', I downgrade the scvi-tools version to '0.9.0' so that the scgen can be import normally.\r\n\r\nI think that may be an issue of the basic usage of scGen, could you please check the initial script and update related code to match the latest version of scvi-tools.\r\n\r\nLei","closed_by":{"login":"adamgayoso","id":10859440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU5NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10859440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso","html_url":"https://github.com/adamgayoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamgayoso/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
