After testing, the following problems were found:\r\nThe correlation between the predicted result obtained by the `prediction` and the `control` result is high, while the correlation between the `predicted` and the `stimulated` result is low, and the correlation between the `control` and `stimulated` is also low. We speculate that SCGEN may have failed to predict drug perturbations in specific cell lines, thus maintaining a high degree of correlation in very unmedicated samples (ie, `control`).\r\n\r\nThe data we used is from [MIX-Seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17440-w).\r\n\r\nThe correlation results is following:\r\npredict vs stimulated:\r\n![pred_vs_stim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23551953/165508855-a343e06d-d25d-447d-8968-3cf8cda38621.png)\r\n\r\npredict vs control:\r\n![pred_vs_ctrl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23551953/165508911-42c8c1df-e036-4497-ae65-62a0b43f8dc2.png)\r\n\r\ncontrol vs stimulated:\r\n![ctrl_vs_stim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23551953/165509020-9b070416-b930-457a-967a-8cc72baead26.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
