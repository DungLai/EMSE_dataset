Specifically, I am training on certain tissues and want to use the model's prediction on other tissues. The data for these unseen tissues are stored in a separate file from the training data.\r\n\r\nThe code to do this would look like:\r\n```python\r\n# Training\r\ncolumn_tissue = 'celltype'\r\ntrain_adata = scanpy.read('train_file.h5ad')\r\nscgen.SCGEN.setup_anndata(train_adata, batch_key=None, labels_key=column_tissue)\r\nmodel = scgen.SCGEN(train_adata, **model_kwargs)\r\nmodel.train(...)\r\n# Testing\r\ntest_adata = scanpy.read('test_file.h5ad')\r\nmodel.get_decoded_expression(adata=test_adata, indices=...)\r\n```\r\nThis outputs:\r\n\r\n> INFO     Received view of anndata, making copy.                                              \r\n> INFO     Input AnnData not setup with scvi-tools. attempting to transfer AnnData setup       \r\n\r\nAnd ends on:\r\n\r\n> ValueError: Category XXXX not found in source registry. Cannot transfer setup without `extend_categories = True`.\r\n\r\nWhere XXXX is a tissue that was absent from the training file.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the correct way to do this? I cannot find any way to pass the extend_categories kwarg.\r\n\r\n### What I tried\r\n\r\nAfter digging into the source code I imagine this would involve something like:\r\n`model.register_manager(model.adata_manager.transfer_fields(adata_target=test_adata, extend_categories=True))`\r\nBut I cannot find how to make the model use this new manager.\r\n\r\nFor now, a workaround is to set the categories in the test data to a category that was present in the training data.For example, setting the tissue column in the test data to the first tissue in the registry of the model:\r\n```\r\ntest_adata.obs = test_adata.obs.rename(columns={column_tissue: 'test_celltype'})\r\ntest_adata.obs[column_tissue] = model.adata_manager.registry['field_registries']['labels']['state_registry']['categorical_mapping'][0]\r\n```\r\nHowever this is quite an unsatisfactory solution and there is certainly a cleaner way of doing this.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
