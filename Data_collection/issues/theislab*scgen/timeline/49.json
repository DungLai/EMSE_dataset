:"Hey @M0hammadL thanks for the response but I'm still having trouble getting the package working on larger datasets.\r\n\r\nLooking through the package code I believe ctrl_adata.X is from adata that was added during initialization of the model and is sparse but can't be sure without altering the package code. The adata.X that goes into the model is a sparse csr matrix and adata.X.A is an ndarray of floats. I don't quite know what you mean by normalizing ctrl_adata.X and ctrl_adata.X.A together. Line 155 of _scgen.py seems to be trying to set them equal? What should be normalized?\r\n\r\nCould you provide some clarity on what the differences are between ctrl_adata.X and ctrl_adata.X.A?\r\n\r\nEven when I try to cast both adata.X and adata.X.A as sparse matrices, I get the same error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> train = sc.read('/net/trapnell/vol1/home/acmullen/VAEs/data/fishVAEData.h5ad')\r\n>>> adata = sc.AnnData(train)\r\n>>> adata.X = adata.X.tocsr()\r\n>>> adata.X.A = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(adata.X.A)\r\n>>> train_new = scgen.setup_anndata(adata,copy=True,batch_key=\"timepoint\", labels_key=\"gene_target\")\r\n>>> model = scgen.SCGEN(train_new)\r\n>>> scipy.sparse.issparse(model.adata.X)\r\nTrue\r\n>>> type(model.adata.X)\r\n<class 'scipy.sparse.csr.csr_matrix'>\r\n>>> type(model.adata.X.A)\r\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\r\n\r\n>>> model.train(\r\n    max_epochs=100,\r\n    batch_size=32,\r\n    early_stopping=True,\r\n    early_stopping_patience=25\r\n)\r\n\r\n>>> pred, delta = model.predict(\r\n...     ctrl_key='18h',\r\n...     stim_key='24h',\r\n...     celltype_to_predict='tbx16'\r\n... )\r\nObservation names are not unique.

error by deploying a few suggestions from similar issues (e.g., adata = adata.copy, updating sciPy, etc.)., however, none of these options resolve my issue. I've also tried reverting back to my original computing environment, however, I still get the same error. \r\n\r\nMy Anndata object contains ~166K total cells and 3000 genes. I was able to get this command to work with the pancreas demo dataset provided, so I think my dataset size might be causing this issue?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/advice you might have would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nBelow are the packages/versions I'm running in my
