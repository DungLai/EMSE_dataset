The problem probably comes from the fact, that there is only 1 object in `shared_ct`, so that the key `concat_batch` is not created during concatenation and can therefore not be removed. This then throws the error. I fixed this issue by simply adding a statement checking whether the `concat_batch` key is contained as a column before deleting it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/504234995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mumichae","id":51025211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDI1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51025211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae","html_url":"https://github.com/mumichae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumichae/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/504610422","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/scgen/issues/1#issuecomment-504610422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/1","id":504610422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDYxMDQyMg==","user":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-22T00:28:28Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T00:28:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi, Thanks for mentioning this, now it should be fixed.
