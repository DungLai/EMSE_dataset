Hi @M0hammadL ,\r\n> \r\n> I've been using `scGen` on CPUs and it has definitely ran in multiple CPU's before. Using 500K cells with 10K HVGs on a machine with 30 CPUs this step took ~ 3 hrs, which is OK for now.\r\n> \r\n> I have tried to run `scGen` on a GPU server in the past, but this didn't work. However, I'm happy to give it a try again. Can you provide some advice on the set up to run `scGen` on GPUs?\r\n\r\nOk, I would say first Install `scgen` and then remove the tf installed by `scgen`. Next, install tensorflow-gpu and check whether `scgen` uses the GPU.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/612537131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3224613086,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIyNDYxMzA4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/events/3224613086","actor":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-11T23:46:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3224613088,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMjQ2MTMwODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/events/3224613088","actor":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-11T23:46:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3612966632,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYxMjk2NjYzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/events/3612966632","actor":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-02T04:27:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
