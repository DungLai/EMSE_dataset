I saved both before and after training, but ended up simply using the original model itself going forward, rather than loading and using the saved model. Loading the save of the model before training results in an error, whereas loading the save of the model after training does not. Thank you so much for clearing up the confusion! One last clarification then, for your example of perturbation prediction, should the save function in cell [7] be called after training in cell [8] for loading in the future? Thanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/889657777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lin-K76","id":68613530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjEzNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68613530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76","html_url":"https://github.com/Lin-K76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin-K76/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5166883881,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTE2Njg4Mzg4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/events/5166883881","actor":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-17T06:29:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
