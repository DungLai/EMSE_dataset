I am sorry I did not make myself clear. I am quite interested in your method scgen applied to  integration of datasets. In [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/M0hammadL/scGen_notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/scgen_batch_removal.ipynb) example, the VAE network needs the cell type labels as a part of input. Does that mean batch removal based on scgen is a supervised learning algorithm as it need the cell type labels? As your method extremely outperforms other batch removal methods which do no need labels, I want to make sure whether your method uses additional information except for the gene expression matrix. Hoping your reply.

lot!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/568166450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yzcv","id":22290650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjkwNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22290650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv","html_url":"https://github.com/yzcv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzcv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/comments/578537084","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/scgen/issues/18#issuecomment-578537084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/scgen/issues/18","id":578537084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODUzNzA4NA==","user":{"login":"M0hammadL","id":33202701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAyNzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33202701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL","html_url":"https://github.com/M0hammadL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M0hammadL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-26T19:57:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T19:57:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey,
