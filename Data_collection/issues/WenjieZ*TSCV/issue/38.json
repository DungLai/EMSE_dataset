It is used in this evaluation paper [(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11744)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11744) and has good performance compared to all other CV-methods - some of which you have implemented here.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, it is somewhat like `sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit` but with a randomized selection of all possible folds. Here is the description from the paper as an image:\r\n\r\n![Unbenannt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6574368/120332592-31002f00-c2ef-11eb-88bc-032f8785e818.PNG)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe authors provided code in R but it is written very differently than how it needs to look in Python. I adapted your functions to implement it in python but I am not the best coder and it really only serves my purpose of tuning a specific model. Seeing as the performance of **Rep-Holdout** is good and -to me at least - it makes sense for time series cross validation, maybe you are interested in adding this function to your package?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WenjieZ/TSCV/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WenjieZ/TSCV/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
