There is no single fixed rule that can handle all cases, and many heuristics are available for choice. I do have some professional insight on this issue, but they cannot be made clear within a couple of sentences. I can give you some quick and dirty advice though: try some small gap sizes and check whether your conclusion stays the same with and without the gaps (cf. stress test and scenario analysis).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WenjieZ/TSCV/issues/comments/804009596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WenjieZ","id":6860682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjA2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6860682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ","html_url":"https://github.com/WenjieZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenjieZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4492038423,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ5MjAzODQyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WenjieZ/TSCV/issues/events/4492038423","actor":{"login":"mksamelson","id":16664483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY0NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16664483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson","html_url":"https://github.com/mksamelson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mksamelson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T19:06:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
