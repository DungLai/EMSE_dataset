My problem with the `GapRollForward` is that - without adjusting/tuning the various input arguments - it lead to overfitting when finetuning my time series forecasting task. E.g. I have 2.5 years and choose the first 2 years as the min_train_size and then do rolling cross validation from that point onwards. Although this rolling prediction closely resembles the actual prediction procedure, when I use it as part of hyperparameter tuning for the underlying method it naturally overfits to the data outside of the `min_train_size`. \r\n\r\nThat is why I liked the **RepHoldout**; because if used as part of a tuning procedure it removes the bias induced by `min_train_size` and results in a more even crossvalidation performance. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I understand your suggestion correctly but I compared a small example here with the Rep-Holdout:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom

     min_test_size=n-window[1], \r\n                    max_test_size=np.inf, \r\n                    roll_size=(window[1]-window[0])//(m-1))\r\nfor train, test in cv.split(range(n)):\r\n    print(\"train:\", train, \"test:\", test)\r\n```\r\ntrain: [0] test: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\r\n 25 26 27 28 29]\r\ntrain: [0 1] test: [ 2  3  4  5  6
