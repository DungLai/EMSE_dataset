Somehow, two_sample escaped the unit tests so far, sorry for that. This error `ValueError: cannot model more than one scale parameter with numpy backend right now.` was thrown because in `two_sample`, a default dispersion model was set that is not supported anymore by the new (more stable) GLM backend. I changed this default in diffxpy `dev` branch, feel free to check it out. The first error was also related to this, at least I cannot reproduce it anymore after including this fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/590768253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3068617562,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2ODYxNzU2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3068617562","actor":{"login":"dburkhardt","id":8322751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjI3NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8322751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/dburkhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-25T09:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3068617567,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjg2MTc1Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3068617567","actor":{"login":"dburkhardt","id":8322751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjI3NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8322751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/dburkhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dburkhardt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-25T09:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
