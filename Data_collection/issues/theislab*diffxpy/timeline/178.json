you @davidsebfischer, indeed the problem was with pip3. Therefore, first I update pip by \r\npip install -U spyder\r\n then I install both batchglm and diffxpy, \r\nthen I try them by pip but I get this error\r\n\r\nERROR: Cannot uninstall 'llvmlite'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\r\nThen I solve this issue by getting help from #841. Then again I install them and now they are working.\r\n\r\nI add this description for reference.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/687347067/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"susanGhaderi","id":25219835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE5ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25219835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi","html_url":"https://github.com/susanGhaderi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3731310554,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzczMTMxMDU1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3731310554","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-04T19:46:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3731310563,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MzEzMTA1NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3731310563","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-04T19:46:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3731311285,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzczMTMxMTI4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3731311285","actor":{"login":"susanGhaderi","id":25219835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE5ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25219835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi","html_url":"https://github.com/susanGhaderi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanGhaderi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-04T19:46:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via
