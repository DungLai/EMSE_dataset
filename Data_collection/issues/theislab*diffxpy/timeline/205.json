This is currently not supported as grouping formats are lost during parsing, the current state may also be desirable because this makes the test output invariable wrt data permutation.

thank you for the response. From my testing and tinkering it seems the issue is using numpy's `unique` function in https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/b8c6ae0d7d957db72e41bc2e705c240348c66509/diffxpy/testing/utils.py#L114.\r\n\r\nThe `numpy.unique` function sorts the unique values before returning the output.  The `pandas.Series.unique()` method actually returns the unique values based on the order encountered, which works for my use-case provided I pre-sort the adata.obs object beforehand.  I went into my local copy of diffxpy and changed that line to `pd.Series(grouping).unique()`, and it does give the output I was expecting as well as a mirrored volcano plot when I switch my two conditions.\r\n\r\nI was thinking I could create a PR for this, but being it was a one-line change, I would want to know if this change is feasible for the bigger picture. Also should this be expanded as an option for the t-test/rank-test functions, or does that not matter so much since some people may not care which condition is the baseline/reference?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/882572792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adkinsrs","id":5665914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjU5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5665914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs","html_url":"https://github.com/adkinsrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adkinsrs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5038663587,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTAzODY2MzU4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/5038663587","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T14:01:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5038663594,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUwMzg2NjM1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/5038663594","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T14:01:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/882629570","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/205#issuecomment-882629570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/205","id":882629570,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFAGUM40m9vC","user":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_

a lot for looking into this @adkinsrs! The issue with using pandas functions here is that the argument `grouping` of `split_x` does not necessarily receive `pandas.Series` in all cases. In particular in this case, if `grouping` was given to `t_test` as string pointing to a column in an `adata.obs`, this line her decomposes the `pandas.Series` https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/b8c6ae0d7d957db72e41bc2e705c240348c66509/diffxpy/testing/utils.py#L109. I guess you gave the `pandas.Series` directly to `t_test::grouping` instead of going via the string? \r\n\r\nWe could however extend your fix, encoding the error in the category order of the `pandas.Series`, and return this order as additional return from https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/b8c6ae0d7d957db72e41bc2e705c240348c66509/diffxpy/testing/utils.py#L105, which needs to be accepted in a few places centred around 2-group tests in https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/dev/diffxpy/testing/tests.py, and then add this additional group order input to \r\n- [ ] https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/80478b0a12bb8160c746859260828c8ee7f510bc/diffxpy/testing/tests.py#L861\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/blob/80478b0a12bb8160c746859260828c8ee7f510bc/diffxpy/testing/tests.py#L903\r\n\r\nWe could leave this option out for `pairwise` and `versus_rest` for now. I think having this as an additional argument in the code that is hidden from the user (outlined above) is desirable of encoding it as a `pandas.Series` as they tend to make code harder to understand
