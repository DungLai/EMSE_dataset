In that case, variance still depends on condition because variance = f(modelled mean, dispersion). Note that this also depends on size factors! I find it most useful to look at **cell-wise** model output in these cases as this avoids errors. You can always group cells by condition and check whether they are the same. To look at cell-wise model fits, just use model.loc (mean prediction for cell and gene) or model.scale (dispersion for NB, prediction for cell and gene), see also https://github.com/theislab/batchglm/blob/master/batchglm/models/glm_nb/model.py. We don't have standard deviation implemented if I remeber correctly, I ll comment on that later, you can compute this easily from mean and dispersion per cell.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/744408188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/762381447","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/183#issuecomment-762381447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/183","id":762381447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MjM4MTQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"ilibarra","id":2761796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjE3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2761796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra","html_url":"https://github.com/ilibarra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilibarra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-18T17:22:44Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T17:22:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey @davidsebfischer ,\r\n\r\nThanks for the input!
