I'm using master branch and default dtype seems float64. I was wondering why it's not lower. Given that I have zero p-values, I should be able to see lower p-values with float64, no?\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay @gokceneraslan, I think I have not propgated the precision all the way into the GLM backend for the numpy/dask default optimiser. Otherwise, this may also occur at the level of the evaluation of the test statistic distribution, will look into this. For now, maybe think about whether you really need this to move forward? At that level of significance, I usually threshold based on mean effects (in addition to pvalues) rather than distinguishing between extremely low pvalues because they are more meaningful in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/630018119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3346084752,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0NjA4NDc1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3346084752","actor":{"login":"gokceneraslan","id":1140359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan","html_url":"https://github.com/gokceneraslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T08:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3346084754,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDYwODQ3NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3346084754","actor":{"login":"gokceneraslan","id":1140359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan","html_url":"https://github.com/gokceneraslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T08:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/658369753","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/152#issuecomment-658369753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/152","id":658369753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODM2OTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"gokceneraslan","id":1140359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan","html_url":"https://github.com/gokceneraslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceneraslan/received_events","type"
