Two components here are \r\n\r\n- how to run multiple testing correction - this depends a bit whether one uses this functionality as a convenience but does not actually check all resutlts or whether really all tests are considered\r\n- how to summarize qvalues - this is a data communication question. in the case of minimum, one would consider all tests, it would then make sense to FDR correct all together as well. now you are still left with #tests p values per gene, depending on you setting you may be interested in different questions here. essentially, a gene wise summary table will always simplify things here. if you are interested in a different summary, just let me know, this can be added in very small PRs! happy for feedback on what you would find useful!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/657424012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3538464570,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUzODQ2NDU3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3538464570","actor":{"login":"jingxinfu","id":16518065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTE4MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16518065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu","html_url":"https://github.com/jingxinfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T09:01:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3538464575,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1Mzg0NjQ1NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3538464575","actor":{"login":"jingxinfu","id":16518065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTE4MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16518065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu","html_url":"https://github.com/jingxinfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxinfu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T09:01:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3538465376,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNTM4NDY1Mzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3538465376","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-13T09:01:33Z","assignee":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"htt
