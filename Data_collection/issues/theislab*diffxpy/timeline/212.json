with https://github.com/theislab/batchglm/pull/146\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `batchglm`.  The main outstanding question mentioned on slack is whether the 5 failing tests in `test_constrained.py` and `test_pairwise_null.py` should be deleted.  It seems to me that they are trying to do the impossible by fitting more than one scale parameter but I feel somewhat uncertain here because I have had trouble with constraints before and I am not familiar with Z-tests.  Other than that, feel free to ask why I did anything!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/218/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
