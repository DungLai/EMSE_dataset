This is also computed separately after the tf session is closed. I also fixed that. Is there no way to get this when the tf session is summarized, ie is this not also computed e.g. when gradients are computed etc? @Hoeze \r\n\r\nBoth caches introduced here

yes I was actually thinking that this behaves exactly like a tensorflow operation would. I did not cache the full log probs matri but only its sum across genes, ie features x 1 array. This is costly to compute and easy to save, so I think it should be cached.
