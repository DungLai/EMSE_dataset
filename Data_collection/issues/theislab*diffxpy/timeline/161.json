You can fit NB models also on data that does not only contain integers, the further you stray from NB distributed data, the less this analysis makes sense though. With normalized and log transformed data, I would tend first try a Gaussian noise model, we do not have that yet but hopfully soon. However, you might want to revisit what you are trying to achieve: Are you comparing two groups? If so, given that you data is strongly processed to look more gaussian, you could also just run a t-test. Exploring GLMs / LMs here makes sense if you have a strong confounder, for example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/641122517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3423680212,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyMzY4MDIxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3423680212","actor":{"login":"slieped","id":19517768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTE3NzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19517768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped","html_url":"https://github.com/slieped","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T08:29:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3423680213,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MjM2ODAyMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3423680213","actor":{"login":"slieped","id":19517768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTE3NzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19517768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped","html_url":"https://github.com/slieped","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slieped/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T08:29:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3423683449,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MjM2ODM0NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3423683449","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T08:30:29Z","label":{"name":"stats
