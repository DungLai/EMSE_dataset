For most scenarios, I recommend negative binomial noise and for that you should provided unprocessed counts, ie integer values that come out of the aligner. Let me know if that is unclear. \r\nWe are working on the speed issue, we are introducing new estimation backends this week, I will comment again in this issue then! Would you mind sharing your diffxpy call, or just your `formula_loc`?
