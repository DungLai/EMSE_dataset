In differential expression analysis on categorical covariates in R and in python we often refer to two differen things: (1) factors/covariates/predictors, which correspond to sets of parameters and (2) levels/groups, which correspond to individual parameters. 'endo', 'neuron', 'fibro', 'beta', 'alpha', 'stem' are all groups, those are unique entries of a list of strings or a pandas categorical series. \"condition\" is a covariate here. Patsy is complaining because you try to set up a model based on a group.\r\n\r\nDifferential expression analysis is usually interfaced so that the user requests to **test covariates rather than groups**, this is done because this gives the framework freedom to assemble parameters as required which can be complex if there is confounding or interaction terms for example. So to run diffxpy on the comparison of two groups, you should first subset the adata object and then test the new covariate \"condition\" that now only contains two unique groups:\r\n\r\n> test = de.test.wald(\r\ndata=adata[[x in [\"neuron\", \"stem\"] for x in adata.obs[\"condition\"]], :].raw,\r\nformula_loc=\"~1+condition\",\r\nfactor_loc_totest=\"condition\",\r\nnoise_model=\"nb\",\r\nsample_description=adata.sample_description,\r\ntraining_strategy=\"DEFAULT\",\r\ndtype=\"float64\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nBy the way, de.test.versus_rest is handling this in a very similar fashion! Accordingly, the subset of tests that correspond to this comparison should have the same results.\r\n\r\nHope that helped!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/507751745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2454972887,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1NDk3Mjg4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/2454972887","actor":{"login":"Gpasquini","id":35536181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35536181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini","html_url":"https://github.com/Gpasquini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T16:30:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2454972888,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTQ5NzI4ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/2454972888","actor":{"login":"Gpasquini","id":35536181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35536181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini","html_url":"https://github.com/Gpasquini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gpasquini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T16:30:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/508620616","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/92#issuecomment-508620616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/92","id":508620616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODYyMDYxNg==","user":{"login":"ivirshup","id":8238804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzg4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8238804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup","html_url":"https://github.com/ivirshup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivirshup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T03:51:46Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T03:51:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have frequently wished it were easier to compute differential expression between two arbitrary groups.

So the only way to evaluate it is to compare each cluster vs all others through loops.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in comparing condition per cluster (e.g. testing `endo`vs `neuro`  per cluster for all clusters). Did you get to post an example for `partition`? I couldn't find it, but perhaps I didnt look in the correct places. Again, I can test it in a loop, but I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to do it.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm wondering if it is possible to get some `verbose` updates. In `versus_rest` it is mentioned we can include kwargs for `fit`, but I didnt succeed in getting any updates on the progress of `versus_rest`, so I'm unable to understand what it is doing at any
