Does Diffxpy have a default method that calculates size factors if you don't provide them? \r\n\r\nNo, we do not provide that as size factors are sort of a field of its own with a lot of dataset-specific considerations. You can always opt for simpler size factor versions at first if you do not want to read through the literature!\r\n\r\n> Lastly, do you have python code to appropriately calculate size factors that work with diffxpy?\r\n\r\nThe simplest one I use some times is `sf=mean(data, axis=genes) / mean(mean(data, axis=genes))` ie `sf=mean(data, axis=genes); sf = sf/mean(sf)`. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/630012639/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3346045522,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0NjA0NTUyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3346045522","actor":{"login":"mtvector","id":28308459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzA4NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28308459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector","html_url":"https://github.com/mtvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T07:58:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3346045525,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDYwNDU1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3346045525","actor":{"login":"mtvector","id":28308459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzA4NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28308459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector","html_url":"https://github.com/mtvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtvector/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T07:58:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3346045857,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM0NjA0NTg1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/3346045857","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-18T07:58:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
