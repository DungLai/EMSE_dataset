sorry, did not see that soon enough.\r\nJust lower `sf` instead of adjusting min/max since this allows the bounds to depend on the data type.\r\nIn general, this should be sufficient. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you can replace `min_r = np.nextafter(...) / sf` directly with `min_r = np.nextafter(...) / <value>`.\r\n\r\nAlso, watch out if you use float32 vs. float64.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/427344909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hoeze","id":1200058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDAwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1200058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/428973776","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/54#issuecomment-428973776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/54","id":428973776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODk3Mzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-11T14:20:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T14:20:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"True,

you very much, this does not hurry :)\r\n\r\nIf tf.NB is the problem we can swap it with our own implementation like the one in utils.random.NegativeBinomial.\r\nI already wrapped tf.NB with my own NegativeBinomial class to allow for other parameterizations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/429868252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Hoeze","id":1200058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDAwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1200058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/429893686","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/54#issuecomment-429893686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/54","id":429893686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTg5MzY4Ng==","user":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T15:11:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T15:11:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We
