seems that the collapse to effectively single-threading does not occur if the thread resources of tensorflow are not restricted. The hessian is computed in two loops, an outer loop across data batches and an inner loop across genes. It may be that tensorflow chooses to spend it's threads on prefetching data in the outer loop if few threads are given. Accordingly, the best way to mitigate this would be to not restrict resources (i.e. just limit the resources of the python session) or to get rid of the outer loop. The outer loop is not strictly necessary as all computation are carried out on a gene level, so even samples with millions of cells could be handled here without batching. Thoughts,
