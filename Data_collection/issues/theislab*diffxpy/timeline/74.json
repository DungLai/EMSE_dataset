@aopisco, thanks for reporting the issue! I am about to roll out a new version of the backend (batchglm), latest first week of January, this will also fix some remaining run time bottlenecks. Right now training takes long in some cases because the optimizer hyperparameters are not ideal yet for all scenarios, this will be improved in the new batchglm version. Would be great if you could report the versions and your setup in any case! If you havent optimzed tensorflow yet, dont do it just yet - it takes a long time in many cases and I have a feeling that this is a different issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/448756839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2036885768,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjAzNjg4NTc2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/2036885768","actor":{"login":"aopisco","id":25906087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTA2MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25906087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco","html_url":"https://github.com/aopisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-19T21:52:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2036885771,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwMzY4ODU3NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/events/2036885771","actor":{"login":"aopisco","id":25906087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTA2MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25906087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco","html_url":"https://github.com/aopisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-19T21:52:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/comments/448757267","html_url":"https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/issues/74#issuecomment-448757267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/74","id":448757267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODc1NzI2Nw==","user":{"login":"aopisco","id":25906087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTA2MDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25906087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco","html_url":"https://github.com/aopisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aopisco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-19T21:54:02Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T21:54:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Hoeze
