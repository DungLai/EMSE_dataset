The variation between samples are better modeled as a random effect. Is it possible to expand diffxpy to include mixed effects models, e.g., generalized linear mixed effects model?\r\nThanks.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/95/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/95/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
