My data consist of 2 time points (juvenile & adult) and 7 samples for those two time points. But when I run the code, I got the error code as following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest = de.test.wald(\r\ndata=adata_lcpm_1,\r\nformula_loc=\"~ 1 + time_point + sample\",\r\n coef_to_test=\"time_point\",\r\nfactor_loc_totest=[\"time_point\", \"sample\"]\r\n)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n ValueError Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-52-76f667c65eff> in <module>\r\n----> 1 test = de.test.wald(\r\n2 data=adata_lcpm_1,\r\n3 formula_loc=\"~ 1 + time_point + sample\",\r\n4 coef_to_test=\"time_point\",\r\n5 factor_loc_totest=[\"time_point\", \"sample\"]\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/diffxpy/bin/diffxpy/diffxpy/testing/tests.py in wald(data, factor_loc_totest, coef_to_test, formula_loc, formula_scale, as_numeric, init_a, init_b, gene_names, sample_description, dmat_loc, dmat_scale, constraints_loc, constraints_scale, noise_model, size_factors, batch_size, backend, train_args, training_strategy, quick_scale, dtype, **kwargs)\r\n645\r\n646 # Build design matrices and constraints.\r\n--> 647 design_loc, design_loc_names, constraints_loc, term_names_loc = constraint_system_from_star(\r\n648 dmat=dmat_loc,\r\n649 sample_description=sample_description,\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/diffxpy/bin/diffxpy/diffxpy/testing/utils.py in constraint_system_from_star(dmat, sample_description, formula, as_numeric, constraints, return_type)\r\n264 as_categorical = True\r\n265\r\n--> 266 return glm.data.constraint_system_from_star(\r\n267 dmat=dmat,\r\n268 sample_description=sample_description,\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/diffxpy/bin/batchglm/batchglm/data.py in constraint_system_from_star(dmat, sample_description, formula, as_categorical, constraints, return_type)\r\n248 if cmat is None:\r\n249 if np.linalg.matrix_rank(dmat) != dmat.shape[1]:\r\n--> 250 raise ValueError(\r\n251 \"constrained design matrix is not full rank: %i %i\" %\r\n252 (np.linalg.matrix_rank(dmat), dmat.shape[1])\r\n\r\nValueError: constrained design matrix is not full rank: 7 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have found a similar issue here, but it was resolved by using `as_numeric` parameter. Meanwhile, the 'sample' factor is categorical and thus can't be resolved by that method. Could you help me to resolve this problem? Thank you!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI posted this beforehand in the tutorial github, while it should be here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
