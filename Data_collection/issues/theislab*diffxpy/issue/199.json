Sometimes I got really low reported log2fc (that would be filtered out if using usual DE filtering thresholds) and other times they were \"normal\". I figured out that the difference is because I once scaled my variable of interest to [0,1] while the other time it was approx 10x bigger; other covariates had the same range in both cases. This of course affected the fitted coefficient and thus reported log2fc, which seems to be the tilt of the line, right? Maybe this could be added in documentation (if not already and I just overlooked it) or the \"log2fc\" column in summary could be renamed in cases when it is in fact not log2fc.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
