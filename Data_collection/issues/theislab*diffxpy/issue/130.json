Is that intentional? \r\n\r\n### The setup: \r\nI added diffxpy to the DE benchmark by [Van den Berge 2019](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1406-4).\r\n\r\nUnder v0.6.13, diffxpy `wald_test` with `nb` noise-model produces results highly comparable to `edgeR` or a NB-model from python [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/devel/):\r\n\r\n*True positive and false positive rate on simulated data at an FDR-cutoff of 0.05*: \r\n\r\n|Method | nDE | TPR(%) | FDR(%)|\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nedgeR | 78 | 7.1 | 9.0\r\ndiffxpy_wald | 84 | 7.7 | 8.3\r\nstatsmodels_nb | 85 | 7.7 | 9.4\r\n\r\nHowever, under v0.7.1, the FDR is significantly inflated for `diffxpy`: \r\n\r\n|Method | nDE | TPR(%) | FDR(%)|\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\nedgeR | 78 | 7.1 | 9.0\r\ndiffxpy_wald | 224 | 19.3 | 13.8\r\nstatsmodels_nb | 85 | 7.7 | 9.4\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\nThe full analysis reports are available here:\r\n* [v0.6.13](https://grst.github.io/benchmark-single-cell-de-analysis/results/diffxpy_0.6.13/benchmark_islam.html#nde-tpr-fdr-pvalue-0.05)\r\n* [v0.7.1](https://grst.github.io/benchmark-single-cell-de-analysis/results/diffxpy_0.7.1/benchmark_islam.html#nde-tpr-fdr-pvalue-0.05)\r\n\r\nThe analysis is available at https://github.com/grst/benchmark-single-cell-de-analysis/. \r\nEverything is wrapped in a nextflow pipeline that uses conda envs. Simply running `nextflow run ./benchmark.nf` should reproduce the above reports. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
