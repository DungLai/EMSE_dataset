In addition, inside the Walds function, I only see the nb option (default).\r\nI was wondering if given the nature of my data (normalized and ?log-transformed? ) if there is any noise model recommendation by you guys. I would prefer to stick with your tool instead of moving to limma or other packages.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
