It would be greatly beneficial if the `wald_statistic`s calculated by `wald_test()` was included in the `summary()` DataFrame so that we could compare more easily to other methods. Is this feasibly implementable by the developers?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJames","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
