I am interested in using diffxpy to run some models of differential expression we current use limma for. I think everything is here, but I am not seeing an example of fitting a trend to gene variance as in limma trend and shrinkage concept in DESeq.\r\n\r\nIs diffxpy more center on single-cell where the larger N makes empirical estimates of variance more reliable? Or is there a feature to of diffxpy I am missing in the docs that allows me to do something similar to limma trend?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you're able to offer!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
