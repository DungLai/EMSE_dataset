So there are three group of genes in total now in obs. However, t test can only performed on data that has exactly 2 groups. Than i get an error when try to use this method. So I wonder is there a way to work this out?[image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98245916/150663500-4aba0e21-f3e5-48f4-8618-c1eacb1b7174.jpeg)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
