My end-goal was to take the DE results and make a volcano plot.  After reading some of the scanpy Github issue tickets (https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/397), I learned of diffxpy and how it seems to be recommended for DEG over scanpy in general situations.\r\n\r\nI like how there is less need to transform the `diffxpy.api.test.t_test` output when compared to the output of `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` to get the data into a format to create a volcano plot for my code.  However, it seems that no matter which order I supply the two conditions for the t-test, the resulting output is the same.  This results in some volcano plots that, when compared to a plot made using `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` output, has about the same p-val but a log-fold change with the opposite sign.\r\n\r\nIs there some easy way of forcing one of the conditions to be the reference condition for the diffxpy DEG tests?  I apologize if I'm missing some inherent understanding or limitation of the tool.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think this question relates to #188 and to #184.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
