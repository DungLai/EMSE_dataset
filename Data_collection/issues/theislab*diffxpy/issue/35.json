user to set up a test such as a Wald test on the effect of condition in a model ~1+condition and broadcast this across a range of subset in each of which this test is supposed to be carried our for each gene. We could for example define a class \"mapreduce_single\" (or similar) which takes the data set and defines the subsetting in the constructor. This class would be handed the data object and the observation meta data vector which conains assignments to louvain groups. Secondly, this class contains a wrapper for each of the test_single methods which calls this test on each gene and each subset of the data, yielding number of subsets many p-values and a test_multi object. This would simplify such tasks for the user and we could generate better overview/enrichment information for such scenarios.\r\n\r\nI think we can keep model fitting compartmentalised in the subsets for now, in principle one could fit one global model for the scenarios based on wald tests (no intercept!), this is a bit similar to how test_pairwise is fit.
