would be good to give the user the option to not model variance beyond the MME. We could trigger this when design_scale=\"~0\". One use case would be two-sample tests: We can directly compute the model in closed form if we leave the dispersion at the MME, which we means that this is pretty much the same speed as t-test and that the z-test migth even be faster than that. Here it might also make sense to check out the closed form hessian so that we never have to call the TensorFlow backend. It would definitely be good to have this as a benchmark together with T-test and full MLE Wald / z-test.","closed_by":{"login":"Hoeze","id":1200058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDAwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1200058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
