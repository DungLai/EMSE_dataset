However, the documentation for intention of use is lacking. For instance, when performing marker gene identification, there is no documentation for it in diffxpy. \r\n\r\nThus far I have resorted to the following: \r\n```python\r\nadata.obs['tmp'] = [ '0' if i == cl else '1' for i in adata.obs[clusterColumn]\r\nrank = de.test.t_test( data = adata, grouping = 'tmp' )\r\n```\r\nI.e. separate cluster of interest from the rest, thereafter perform a differential gene expression. \r\n\r\nIs this sufficent for marker identification in `diffxpy`, @falexwolf, @davidsebfischer ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
