Think about reducing redundant code, in particular design matrix building and model fitting.\r\n2. Check out new DifferentialExpressionTest meta class.\r\n3. Improve api for many to many tests (not DifferentialExpressionTest).\r\n4. Build sgdlgm interface that allows separate location and scale parameter models. This is the python naming, for nb loc=mean und scale=dispersion model.\r\n5. Check out function annotation: I think this is comprehensive, this is the level of detail that we need for user exposed functions.","closed_by":{"login":"davidsebfischer","id":11200205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsebfischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsebfischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
