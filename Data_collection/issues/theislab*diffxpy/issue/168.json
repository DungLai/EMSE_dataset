Following the tutorial, I used this script to conduct my analysis.\r\n```\r\npart = de.test.partition(\r\n    data=data_part,\r\n    parts=\"sample\"\r\n)\r\ntest_part = part.wald(\r\n    formula_loc=\"~ 1 + condition\",\r\n    factor_loc_totest=\"condition\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\nNext, I was checking how `diffxpy` combine p-values from different groups and found this:\r\n```\r\n        res = pd.DataFrame({\r\n            \"gene\": self.gene_ids,\r\n            # return minimal pval by gene:\r\n            \"pval\": np.min(self.pval.reshape(-1, self.pval.shape[-1]), axis=0),\r\n            # return minimal qval by gene:\r\n            \"qval\": np.min(self.qval.reshape(-1, self.qval.shape[-1]), axis=0),\r\n            # return maximal logFC by gene:\r\n            \"log2fc\": np.asarray(logfc),\r\n            # return mean expression across all groups by gene:\r\n            \"mean\": np.asarray(self.mean)\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        return res\r\n```\r\nWould you mind kindly telling me why to choose the minimum p value across groups?\r\nI was wondering that it might increase the amount of significant genes in this way.\r\nWould other methods, like `fisher method` https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.combine_pvalues.html, be better?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
