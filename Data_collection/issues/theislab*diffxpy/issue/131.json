Once #117 is fixed, this would also be possible with diffxpy. \r\n\r\nHowever, zingeR and zinbWAVE are quite slow, and it could probably be sped up significantly, or at least massively parallelized when implemented with tensorflow. Ideally, this would be available right from `diffxpy` as an additional noise model.\r\n\r\nThere's already a tensorflow implementation of a ZINB model available in the [scqtl](https://github.com/aksarkar/scqtl) package. Also there's a ZINB model implemented in numpy within the [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.discrete.count_model.ZeroInflatedNegativeBinomialP.html) package from which you could draw some inspiration ;) \r\n\r\nIs that something you would consider implementing in a future version of diffxpy? \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nGregor \r\n\r\nCC @abyssum\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
