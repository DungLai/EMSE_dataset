I also have some code to make a volcano plot in line [111] [here](https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial/blob/master/Case-study_Mouse-intestinal-epithelium.ipynb). Don't know if this is still needed, but I thought I would see if someone cares.\r\n\r\n@davidsebfischer do you allow labels in your volcano plot function? And can it take any object, or only some custom `diffxpy` ones? If these things aren't a problem I'd prefer to use yours tbh.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @LuckyMD in https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/460#issuecomment-471522186_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/81/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/theislab/diffxpy/issues/81/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
