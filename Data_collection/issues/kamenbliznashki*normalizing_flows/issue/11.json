In my opinion, due to Glow contains “tensor.slogdet()” operation in affine coupling layer, it may involve SVD decomposition, and thus casue above problem.\r\nSpecifically, I first use a small learning rate, such as 1e-6, the training loss begins to fall slowly. However, when the learning rate reaches 0.0004, the training loss has a sudden rise (inf) and the error information is presented as above.\r\nHow can I avoid this error during training process of Glow？","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kamenbliznashki/normalizing_flows/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kamenbliznashki/normalizing_flows/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
