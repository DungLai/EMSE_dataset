I can't upgrade due to dependency issues, but I think the issue is that I don't have AVX on the CPU I'm using (which is a cloud machine). In TensorFlow 1.6 and later you have to have AVX, or do a custom build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/comments/417111964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rachel-1","id":13966854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY2ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13966854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1","html_url":"https://github.com/rachel-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1816760097,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgxNjc2MDA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/events/1816760097","actor":{"login":"rachel-1","id":13966854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY2ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13966854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1","html_url":"https://github.com/rachel-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-29T21:28:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1816770219,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxODE2NzcwMjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/events/1816770219","actor":{"login":"rachel-1","id":13966854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY2ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13966854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1","html_url":"https://github.com/rachel-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-29T21:34:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/comments/417117314","html_url":"https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/11#issuecomment-417117314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IBM/MAX-Audio-Classifier/issues/11","id":417117314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzExNzMxNA==","user":{"login":"rachel-1","id":13966854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTY2ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13966854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1","html_url":"https://github.com/rachel-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rachel-1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T21:47:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T21:47:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah
