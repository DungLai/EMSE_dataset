I am using this work as a reference for my master's degree in which I will perform classification of industrial safety alert texts.\r\n\r\nWhen replicating code relating to neural networks, I found a slight inconsistency in the following line of README.md (item Deep Learning -> Deep Neural Networks):\r\n\r\n`print(metrics.classification_report (y_test, predicted))\r\n`\r\n\r\n_ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of multiclass and continuous-multioutput targets_\r\n\r\nI evaluated the shapes of y_test and predicted in this case:\r\npredicted.shape: (7532, 20)\r\ny_test.shape: (7532,)\r\n\r\nSo I suggest the following change in the line above to:\r\n\r\n`print(metrics.classification_report (y_test, np.argmax(predicted, axis = 1)))\r\n`\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nWander","closed_by":{"login":"kk7nc","id":21176522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTc2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21176522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc","html_url":"https://github.com/kk7nc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk7nc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kk7nc/Text_Classification/issues/8/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kk7nc/Text_Classification/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
