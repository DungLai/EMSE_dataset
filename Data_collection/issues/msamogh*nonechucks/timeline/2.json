The bad news is you can't call `len` on your DataLoader (unless you're okay with setting `eager_eval` to `True` on your dataset). The good news is, in this case, is that you can simply move the part where you check if it's the last iteration to outside the loop (once it has ended).\r\n\r\nThis is because without actually checking every element, `SafeDataLoader` has no way of telling what the effective number of valid samples in your dataset is going to be. So one of the things you will have to give up with `SafeDataLoader` is the ability to call `len()`.\r\n\r\nHope that
