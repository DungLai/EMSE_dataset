Each annotation contains filename for example aaa.jpg. I load photos based on filename from annotation json file. My image dataset contains 162000 images, so I do not have 400 photos in the collection. If the dataloader comes across the name of the annotation image and is not in the image set, it returns TypeError to me.\r\nDo you know how to catch this error using your library? I tried SafeDataLoader and it does not work.\r\nI also tried try except, but if I print a picture as None, I get a Class TypeNone error.\r\nBest!","closed_by":{"login":"msamogh","id":1230386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1230386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh","html_url":"https://github.com/msamogh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msamogh/nonechucks/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msamogh/nonechucks/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
