I observed, that if I use `SafeDataset` together with standard `DataLoader` (using default sequential sampler), my CPUs are fully loaded. However, when I use the `DataLoader` with `SafeSampler`, then I see usually only one process running and the others are sleeping (probably waiting for synchronization). Could it be that in `SafeSampler __next__()` method the threads needs to be synchronized due to the while loop? It is a really HUGE difference in performance between using and not using SafeSampler... \r\n\r\nHowever, I understand that if I use DataLoader without SafeSampler, then the sampled examples can be returned several times, which is not usable in my case.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @brejchajan in https://github.com/msamogh/nonechucks/issues/5#issuecomment-461499282_","closed_by":{"login":"msamogh","id":1230386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1230386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh","html_url":"https://github.com/msamogh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamogh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msamogh/nonechucks/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/msamogh/nonechucks/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
