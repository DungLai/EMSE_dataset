The height and width must be divided by 2^n (n depends on the times of downsample). Because images will be downsampled and then upsampled.\r\n\r\nYou could hack it by:\r\n1. resize the input image to make the height and width satisfied the condition mentioned above\r\n1. resize the output image back to the original size\r\n\r\nHope this will help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hughplay/DFNet/issues/comments/571560178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hughplay","id":30553791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTUzNzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30553791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay","html_url":"https://github.com/hughplay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2927410906,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyNzQxMDkwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hughplay/DFNet/issues/events/2927410906","actor":{"login":"hughplay","id":30553791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTUzNzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30553791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay","html_url":"https://github.com/hughplay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-07T12:06:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
