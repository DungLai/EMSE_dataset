Thanks for your amazing work. I'm currently adapting your code to train on my own dataset, with slightly different data format. So I'm thinking about tweaking your data loading module a bit to suit my needs. However, your data loading module seems pretty convoluted, with multithreading and buffers, that I found hard to understand. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering, is your code functionally equivalent as `torch.data.utils.DataLoader`? Can I just implement my own Dataset object and use DataLoader for multi-thread reading? Will it be significantly slower than your implementation? Thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"hughplay","id":30553791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTUzNzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30553791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay","html_url":"https://github.com/hughplay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughplay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hughplay/DFNet/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hughplay/DFNet/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
