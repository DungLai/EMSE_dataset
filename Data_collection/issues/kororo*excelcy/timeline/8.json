I am doing lots of ingestion and you have valid point there. However, if excelcy trying to tap into those problems, the project scope is going to be over the places. That is why I am using other packages to get help on the data transformation (for example image -> text). I think the points should be more relevant to the textract package.\r\n\r\nI am adding the extra documentation as per your suggestion. Going to release the newer version.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kororo/excelcy/issues/comments/472299751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kororo","id":689528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTUyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo","html_url":"https://github.com/kororo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kororo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2199288202,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5OTI4ODIwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kororo/excelcy/issues/events/2199288202","actor":{"login":"alejandrojapkin","id":5109806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDk4MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5109806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alejandrojapkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T06:42:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2199288204,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTkyODgyMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kororo/excelcy/issues/events/2199288204","actor":{"login":"alejandrojapkin","id":5109806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDk4MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5109806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alejandrojapkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandrojapkin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T06:42:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
