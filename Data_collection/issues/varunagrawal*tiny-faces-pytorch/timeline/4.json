If you have `n=0` in the dataset, the next line should be blank, and not have any values, else the dataset is incorrect. I tested the use case you defined and the code works fine, especially since the loop will not execute if n is 0.\r\n\r\n2. I have updated the requirements.txt. Thank you for that.\r\n\r\n3. That debug code was actually for my convenience to debug some weird behavior. I have removed it in the latest commits and updated the code. If you run the current master branch, you should get far better results than what you have been getting. There was a bug where I was normalizing the image twice, but I have fixed that and things work great (I am able to get close to the same results as the original implementation from the paper author).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/comments/512361390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"varunagrawal","id":975964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/975964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal","html_url":"https://github.com/varunagrawal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunagrawal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2490103578,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ5MDEwMzU3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/events/2490103578","actor":{"login":"SkyfengBiuBiu","id":28752150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzUyMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28752150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyfengBiuBiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T16:44:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2490103579,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0OTAxMDM1Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/events/2490103579","actor":{"login":"SkyfengBiuBiu","id":28752150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzUyMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28752150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyfengBiuBiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyfengBiuBiu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-17T16:44:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/comments/518507563","html_url":"https://github.com/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/4#issuecomment-518507563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch/issues/4","id":518507563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODUwNzU2Mw==","user":{"login":"Queequeg92","id":8766653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjY2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8766653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92","html_url":"https://github.com/Queequeg92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Queequeg92/received_
