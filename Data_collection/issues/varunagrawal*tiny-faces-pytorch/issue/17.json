I am trying your codebase on a Custom dataset and I have created the JBL and template using the `cluster.py`. My JSON file looks like this: http://dpaste.com/26T5AC9\r\n\r\n1) I am attempting to evaluate the Re-trained model and I observe that your prediction on a new unseen data depends on the precomputed JSON, which was generated based on training set. Is that correct? \r\n\r\n2) Given that it depends on the JSON, I observe a discrepancy between the JSON file you have provided on the repository and the JSON file I created using your code.
