There is no overlap between the classes of the source and target domain (i.e. the sentences are all different).

basic assumption of Domain Adaptation is that there should some overlap classes between source and target. If this assumption is not true in your case, Domain Adaptation may not be applicable.\r\nHowever, I still think there is a chance to apply Domain Adaptation to your task, video captioning. It depends on how you define \"domain\" and \"class\". For example, the \"domain\" can be different video captioning datasets. Although all sentences are different, there should be some overlap words, and you can define classes using words. \r\nThe above are just my preliminary thought. I haven't worked on video captioning, so I am not sure how to directly apply TA3N to this task, but I do believe it's possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/comments/678708803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cmhungsteve","id":17039429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve","html_url":"https://github.com/cmhungsteve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/comments/678784602","html_url":"https://github.com/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/17#issuecomment-678784602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/17","id":678784602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODc4NDYwMg==","user":{"login":"jlim13","id":36393441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzkzNDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36393441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13","html_url":"https://github.com/jlim13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlim13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-23T15:00:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T15:00:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see.
