I am trying to reproduce the UCF-HMDB_{full} results from the ICCV19 paper. i.e. source only, target only, TA^2N, and TA^3N of Table 3 and Table 4 of the paper. But I cannot reproduce the TA^2N and TA^3N results. Can you share the hyperparameter settings of the TA^2N and TA^3N? If you can share the shell script file of those, it would be really helpful. \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"cmhungsteve","id":17039429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17039429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve","html_url":"https://github.com/cmhungsteve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhungsteve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/3/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cmhungsteve/TA3N/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
