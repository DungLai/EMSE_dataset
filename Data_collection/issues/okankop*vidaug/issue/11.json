I am looking for a way to use video data augmentation while training models on video classification/labelling, I know that for images **ImageDataGenerator from Keras** exists as a data augmentor. However, it is not specifically targetted for videos.\r\nHowever, I saw a kind of augmentation used in this website article for [video classification](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/07/15/video-classification-with-keras-and-deep-learning/). I don't know if you came across ImageDataGenerator, but I would like to know if it is possible to use ImageDataGenerator rather than your functions to apply data augmentation for videos ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/okankop/vidaug/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/okankop/vidaug/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
