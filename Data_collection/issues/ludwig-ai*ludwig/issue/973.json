After training, when I compute the jaccard similarity on predictions on test set, by calculating intersection over union, the score does not match with the results given by the library. test_statistics reported jaccard of 0.6661, but I calculated it to be 0.5587. This issue was not there in the previous version.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Download `train_data.csv` from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wp2F4xdiTBJwwvc6ryd50vJi9C2A8dQX/view?usp=sharing) and `test_data.csv` from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgwQDxaTs9y5bO9vO9EvrZyNxUsyOTJv/view?usp=sharing) and place them in `data` dir.\r\n\r\n2. Copy \r\n```yaml\r\ntraining:\r\n    epochs: 1\r\n    validation_field: labels\r\n    validation_measure: jaccard\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: comment_text\r\n        type: sequence\r\n        sequence_length_limit: 128\r\n        representation: dense\r\n        lowercase: true\r\n        embedding_size: 256\r\n        cell_type: lstm\r\n        reduce_output: null\r\n        num_layers: 1\r\n        bidirectional: true\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: labels\r\n        type: set\r\n        validation_field: jaccard_index\r\n```\r\n as `model_definition.yaml`\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Run `ludwig experiment -rs 42 --training_set data/train_data.csv \\\r\n--test_set data/test_data.csv --data_format csv -cf model_definition.yaml`\r\n\r\n4.
