Because in our platform we use latest version of numpy (1.16.1 with pip) and if I'm not wrong, this version creates problem with ludwig:\r\n\r\n```ImportError: Missing required dependencies ['numpy']```\r\n\r\nInstalling ```numpy>=1.15,<1.16``` is ok but it could make conflicts with other features that are in our platform. \r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nQUESTION 2\r\nThis is a technical question: I am trying to implement a regression predictor that has text in input and its output is a two value tuple between 0 and 1 (x , y where 0<x<1 and 0<y<1, formally ). \r\nThis is my model definition: \r\n\r\n```\r\n 'input_features': [ {'name': 'text', \r\n                            'type': 'text' , \r\n                            'encoder': 'rnn', \r\n                            'cell': 'lstm', \r\n                            'bidirectional': 'true'} ], \r\n'output_features': [\r\n                                {'name': 'x', \r\n                                'type': 'numerical'    }, \r\n                                {'name': 'y', \r\n                                'type': 'numerical'}\r\n                            ]\r\n```\r\nBut in this way I get sometimes outputs (in the inference phase) < 0 or > 1. How can I tell \r\noutput_features to produce numerical numbers between 0 and 1 ( sigmoid layer ) ? \r\n\r\nThanks for your support!","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/238/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
