I really appreciate the efforts in making the development so seamless and easy to use. I just tried the visual question-answering example with images and it saves so much more time in implementation. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful to know about the addition of point cloud feature type, I could see it as mentioned in the [What additional features are you working on?](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/faq/#what-additional-features-are-you-working-on) page on docs but could not find it any of the earlier [releases](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/releases) or on the [Github Projects Page](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/projects/1).\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nI feel, 3D Point cloud support (in general nD support) could be a great addition and would help in accelerating 3D research.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI work with 3D lidar data so support for input of `.las`, `.PLY`, `.OBJ`, `.laz`, `.xyz` would be very much helpful. Otherwise, if it is possible to use other availble input feature type which can be used for point clouds and I am not aware of then please enlighten me.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI am exploring if the point cloud input is possible as HDF5 or TSVs or arrays or tensors (would take some time in exploring all the examples :)). I would be grateful to get more insights regarding this.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the work is in progress for the point cloud feature type and if there is a room for contribution, I would love to be a part of it.
