Since this is related to batch size and my images are rather large (500x250) I am constrained by the GPU memory. I have successfully distributed the training on a GPU cluster using horovod and openMPI according to the documentation with the `stacked_cnn` architecture w/o modifications. From what it looks like (to me) the batches themselves are not split but the batches are distributed in their entity. Because when I try to increase the batch size I get errors like that which disappear when I lower the batch size again. \r\n\r\n```\r\nResourceExhaustedError (see above for traceback): OOM when allocating tensor with shape[32,256,250,500] and type float on /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 by allocator GPU_0_bfc\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: is batch splitting across multiple GPU nodes possible at all?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tboo","id":19666785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo","html_url":"https://github.com/tboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
