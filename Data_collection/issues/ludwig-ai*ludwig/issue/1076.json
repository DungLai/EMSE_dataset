Is there a way to preprocess to set a limit on the sequence ? I see ```sequence_length_limit ``` parameter - but not sure if this would achieve that. So the use case is, my input training file may have a timeseries input col which has a sequence of 16 values, but if I want to trim it to say 4, I would want the trailing 4 values to be used. Is that possible ? Trying to see if I can avoid recreating training file with different sequence limit.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
