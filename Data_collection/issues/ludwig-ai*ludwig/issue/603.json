Hence me noticing the commits had become less and less frequent.\r\n\r\nWhen I found out about Ludwig I was ecstatic. This is exactly what is needed and already being done in other respects with stable baselines for RL and Optuna bayesian optimization libraries.  \r\n\r\nPlease continue developing this treasure. I am not being able to contribute as such a thing I feel is beyond me at this point technically. Having said that I have no doubt that Ludwig will capture more attention as it progresses. \r\n\r\nThank you again and best of luck with continued development!\r\n\r\n(Feel free to delete this as it is really not about a feature request)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
