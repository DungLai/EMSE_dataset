Have a question though that I can't seem to figure out. \r\n\r\nI trained a model using a sample data set for banking information which takes in customer demographics and has a binary \"purchase\" column of whether they purchased a certificate of deposit or not (1 or 0). Trying to make a prediction for future customers on that column based on the same.\r\n\r\nI trained my model and have a 90% accuracy after 20 epochs.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2019-02-19 at 11 47 17 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937052/53032336-ab695580-343c-11e9-886b-e422e6e1d879.png)\r\n\r\nBut when I run a predict on a single datapoint with the **--only_predictions** flag.
