Please describe.**\r\nIt would be ideal if there was more documentation around how the training data should be formatted. It would also be helpful to know what packages are being used behind the scenes for sentiment analysis, NER, text classification, etc. \r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nFor example, I want to test out sentiment analysis. Is this built off of a pre-trained model? Would it expect labels like \"positive\", \"negative\", \"neutral\", or can we have as many labels as we'd like? How is this different from text classification?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMore user documentation with examples, information on what packages a model is using, and what training data it's expecting. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
