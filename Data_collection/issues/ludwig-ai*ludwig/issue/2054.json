Add print statements to look at the predictions from the model evaluation calls in `tests.integration_tests.utils.train_with_backend`.\r\n2. Run a test that calls that function, e.g. `tests/integration_tests/test_ray.py::test_ray_image`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect evaluation calls on the same model with the same dataset to produces the same numerical outputs regardless of the backend.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Version: 12.3\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Ludwig version: 0.5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nWe currently workaround this by having some degree of tolerance when comparing the models in unit tests.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"geoffreyangus","id":29719151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29719151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus","html_url":"https://github.com/geoffreyangus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2054/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
