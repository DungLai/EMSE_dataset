For example, the `StackedCNNRNN` module takes 4 different dropout parameters:\r\n- conv_dropout: Dropout rate for the convolutional layers\r\n- recurrent_dropout: Dropout rate for the recurrent layers\r\n- dropout: Dropout rate for sequence embeddings\r\n- fc_dropout: Dropout rate for the final fully connected output layer.\r\n\r\nWhile this is highly expressive, this seems like a configurability overkill -- in the literature there's not much evidence that there's a lot to be gained from using heterogenous dropout rates across a model. On the other hand, unifying all modules to use a single dropout parameter seems like it strikes a better balance.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
