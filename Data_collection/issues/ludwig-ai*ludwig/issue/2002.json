And so, if we track the experiment inside an experiment management system, we would miss important information such as number of workers (to estimate the effective batch size of the model), etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a method that allows a `Backend` class to return the config that was used to initialize it.\r\n\r\nThis issue is non-blocking, and has a P1/P2 prioritization.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
