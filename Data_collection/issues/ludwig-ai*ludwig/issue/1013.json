Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe process of training a GAN could be:\r\n\r\n- step 1, the discriminator trains for one or more epochs\r\n- step2, the generator trains for one or more epochs\r\n- step3, repeat step 1 and step 2 to continue to train the generator and discriminator networks\r\n\r\nIt is quite different from the ECD (Encoder-Combiner-Decoder) procedure. So how could we train a GAN using ludwig?
