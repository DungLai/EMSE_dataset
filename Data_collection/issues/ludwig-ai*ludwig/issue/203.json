Please describe.**\r\nI would like to have a way to use a block stream as input. For example:\r\ninput file contains:\r\ntime1 , 2\r\ntime2 , 3\r\ntime3 , 4\r\ntime4 , 5.5\r\ntime5 , 12\r\n...\r\n\r\nthe features i generate are more then 50k that would mean a 1GB source file would end up with 50TB if i preproceed the data. As this is very disk consuming it would be nice to have a feature to do preprocessing of the last X ammount of rows.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nEven diskspace is cheap novadays, as soon as you have a exponential ammount of features even disks will get expensiv.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI am requesting a feature like a function or something where it calls a python script that does the preprocessing... something like:\r\nludwig -preprocess preprocess.py \r\nAnd in the ludwig yaml a preprocess attribute with how many rows to look back for the preprocess.\r\n\r\nAlternatively stream each row for preparation to the preprocess.py and the preprocess py handles how many rows back to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nBuy more disks :-)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNo additional context required.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
