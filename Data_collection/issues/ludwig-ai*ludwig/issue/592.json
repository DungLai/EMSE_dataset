To start off, I oversample the train csv, but not valid/test csv. For whatever reason, there is a significant variance between 1st and 2nd epoch with the valid/test dataset (consistently drops like below, which seems strange since every run is fresh and I would expect some randomness). It coverges too soon (1st epoch) because the combined loss doesn't make much progress. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"652\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-04 at 5 53 01 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57873718/70197200-e7b22d80-16bf-11ea-85ef-617eac90968c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe true_positive_rate for \"True\" class is ~0.17 and true_positive_rate for \"False\" class is ~0.81 [\"False\" class f1 score = ~0.74, \"True\" class f1 score = ~.021 ] - so it isn't learning \"True\" classifier.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how I could improve ? Oversample valid set (which feels like cheating!), run longer epochs is something I am looking into. But are there other things I should consider ?\r\n\r\nAlso thank you for open sourcing this. It's been so much fun for wannabe practitioners like me! I also understand the question isn't so much tied to ludwig per se, but would greatly appreciate specific knobs that others have tried and tuned. The dataset is mostly binary/category columns with couple of numerical and one text column FWIW. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mangleddata","id":57873718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODczNzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57873718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata","html_url":"https://github.com/mangleddata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
