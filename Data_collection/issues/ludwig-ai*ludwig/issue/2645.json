This is accounted for in [RayDatasetBatcher._prepare_batch](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/b168ca1aa5763bb38e4318a72ab86b29b63bb9de/ludwig/data/dataset/ray.py#L312-L315), where the tensors are reshaped to their original shape.\r\n\r\nHowever, the returned values from `preprocess` remain flat. This seems unexpected from the user's perspective. `preprocess` called with a local backend returns the tensors in their proper shape.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Initialize a LudwigModel with an Image or Audio feature and a Ray backend\r\n2. Run `LudwigModel.preprocess` with `skip_save_processed_input=False`\r\n\r\nThis behavior can also be reproduced by simply running `tests/integration_tests/test_ray.py::test_ray_image` and inspecting the values of the DataFrames returned by the Ray backend after https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/2637 is merged in. The workaround in the unit tests in that PR is to ensure that the tensors are flattened before comparing the outputs of `preprocess` run with both local and Ray backends.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect the tensors to be returned from `preprocess` in their original shape.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
