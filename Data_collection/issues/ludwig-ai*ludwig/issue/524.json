Other callbacks like a [learning rate scheduler](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler) and a [plateau learning rate reducer](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau) are included as well. These callbacks provide more functionality than their counterparts in ludwig.\r\n\r\nI think it might be a good idea to offload these kind of things to keras where possible. Otherwise ludwig will either lack features that ludwig-free tensorflow already has, or time has to be wasted to reimplement existing functionality.","closed_by":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
