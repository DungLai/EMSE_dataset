This is useful if users know they always want to apply certain transformations to their data for every feature of the same type. However, there is no equivalent mechanism for global encoder or decode parameters.\r\n\r\nThis proposal here is to allow the user to define global feature parameters for encoders and decoders in addition to the existing preprocessing params. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Move existing feature preprocessing globals out of the `preprocessing` section such that the preprocessing section is only for things like splitting, etc.\r\n2. Add a new `defaults` section that covers feature type defaults across all features.\r\n\r\nThese changes would also be affected by #2125, which would remove ambiguity between `encoder` and `decoder` params for the same feature type.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\npreprocessing:\r\n    split:\r\n        type: random\r\n        probabilities: [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]\r\n    oversample_minority: 0.5\r\ndefaults:\r\n    category:\r\n        preprocessing:        \r\n            missing_value_strategy: fill_with_const\r\n            fill_value: <UNK>\r\n        encoder:\r\n            type: sparse\r\n        decoder:\r\n            norm_params: null\r\n            dropout: 0\r\n            use_bias: true\r\n        loss:\r\n            type: softmax_cross_entropy\r\n            confidence_penalty: 0\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
