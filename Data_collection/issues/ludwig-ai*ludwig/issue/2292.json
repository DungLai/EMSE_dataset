I worked on some of the torchscript stuff so can help out here a bit.\r\n> \r\n> Next step is probably checking that the exported model works as expected. You can verify this by making a Python dict of inputs, where each key is the CSV column name used for model training and each value is the corresponding inputs.\r\n> \r\n> I took a look at your repository link– for text features, the model will expect a list of strings of length batch_size. For numerical features, the model will expect a tensor.\r\n> \r\n> Once you have this, pass it in to the model and inspect the outputs. Let me know how this goes– super happy to answer any questions you have along the way.\r\n\r\n@geoffreyangus \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nNo tutorial or quick start to using torchscript.\r\n\r\nI don't how to get the feature order needed for inputs in c++.\r\n\r\nProbably the first step is to do this in python.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAble to input test data and get the label which is binary, and its probability so I can compute the resulting corespondence to from one skeleton (source) to another skeleton (sink).\r\n\r\nSo based on advice from @JosephCatrambone I was able to get some results only using category and \"number/boolean\" features.\r\n\r\nI wish to integrate this into my single binary Godot Engine fork . See https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows 11\r\n- Ludwig version \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAttached model in the source folder.\r\n\r\n[src.zip](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/files/9136013/src.zip)\r\n\r\n[export_torchscript.zip](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/files/9136011/export_torchscript.zip)\r\n\r\n[data.zip](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/files/9136017/data.zip) This is a second run so minor changes may result from the seed changing.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
