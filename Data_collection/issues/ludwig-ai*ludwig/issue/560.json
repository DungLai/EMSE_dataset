Please describe.**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\n### Proposal\r\nCreate example programs that demonstrate Ludwig's Python apis.  Example programs will mirror subset of [Ludwig's command line examples](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/examples/).  This proposal covers Python programs for \r\n* Titanic Survivor\r\n* MNIST\r\n* Text Classification\r\n\r\nSample programs will perform perform one or more of the following functions:\r\n* Training\r\n* Predictions\r\n* Visualizations\r\n* Accessing and analyzing Ludwig's results files (e.g., training_statistics.json)\r\n\r\n[This](https://github.com/jimthompson5802/ludwig_examples/tree/master/mnist) illustrates the proposal.\r\n\r\nIf desired, example programs can be provided in both native python programs (*.py) and Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) formats.\r\n\r\nA new sub-directory called `examples` will be created in the project's root directory.  Structure of the `examples` of this new directory follows:\r\n``` \r\n    examples/\r\n        titanic/\r\n            model_training.py\r\n            model_training.ipynb\r\n            model_definition.yaml\r\n            . . .\r\n        mnist/\r\n            . . .\r\n        text/\r\n            . . .\r\n```\r\n\r\n ### Considerations\r\n * If major changes are expected in the apis, then creating example programs \r\n at this time may be premature. \r\n * If significant changes are planned to the structure or format of the results files, then example programs demonstrating access may not make sense.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSample programs and instructions for running the programs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm willing to work on this if the proposal makes sense.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
