I'm looking for some guidance, because my first experiment didn't work. Please let me know if this is not the proper forum for help. \r\n\r\nI have everything installed on my Linux server no errors so far.  I'm using the CLI and decided to see if I could \"predict\" antonyms. I created a CSV with ~5000 words and their opposites:\r\n```\r\nword,opposite\r\nagglomerate,scatter\r\naggrandize,depress\r\naggregate,dissipation\r\naggression,resistance\r\n```\r\nI created a yaml file:\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: word\r\n        type: text\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: opposite\r\n        type: text\r\n```\r\nI trained Ludwig with the following command:\r\n```\r\nludwig train --model_name OPPOSITES --data_csv opposites.csv --model_definition_file opposites.yaml\r\n```\r\nNo apparent problems so far.... \r\nNext, I created a CSV to test the training:\r\n```\r\nword\r\nagglomerate\r\n```\r\nLastly, I ran the predict command:\r\n```\r\nludwig predict --data_csv predict.csv --model_path results/experiment_OPPOSITES/model/\r\n```\r\nThere were no errors, but the resulting opposites_predictions.csv just had 2 lines:\r\n```\r\nsoothe,<PAD>\r\nsoothe,<PAD>\r\n```\r\n\"soothe\" is one of the ~10500 words in the original training CSV, but obviously not relevant to my prediction test... \r\n\r\nThat's it... Being new to Ludwig, I don't know what I'm doing wrong or even which direction to go to resolve things... Any direction or advice would be greatly appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"Budapresst","id":22636225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjM2MjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22636225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst","html_url":"https://github.com/Budapresst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Budapresst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
