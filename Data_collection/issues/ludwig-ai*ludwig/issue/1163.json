As far as I know it is only possible to predict audio data using saved files in the filesystem. In order to make live predictions it would be much faster if there was a way to feed single python objects or wav encoded bytes to the model and let it predict the corresponding class one audio chunk at a time. Is there a way to do that with ludwig with as little overhead as possible?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPeter","closed_by":{"login":"Peetee06","id":17020705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDIwNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17020705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06","html_url":"https://github.com/Peetee06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
