Then I start a Kubernetes Job to play the role of ludwig job driver, I inject `RAY_ADDRESS=ray://10.227.151.166:32471` into the job so `ray.init(auto)` will detect the remote cluster.  After the ludwig job is done, the driver job finishes and I can recycle the remote ray cluster as well.\r\n\r\nI am asking whether that's the best practice? Is there better ideas like submit ludwig job as a Ray job to existing Ray cluster? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
