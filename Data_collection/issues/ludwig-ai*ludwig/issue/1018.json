When I change the order of these within the set, the probability of the prediction changes.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I misunderstood the \"set\" but this surprises me. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThis is one of my input features:\r\n`        {\r\n            'name': 'company_category_list',\r\n            'type': 'set',\r\n            'preprocessing': {\r\n                'format': 'comma'\r\n            }\r\n        }`\r\nFor example a value for this column looks like this: \"Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Hospital\"\r\n\r\nThre are more numerical and category input features.\r\n\r\nMy output feature looks like this:\r\n`'output_features': [\r\n        {\r\n            'name': 'label',\r\n            'type': 'binary'\r\n        }\r\n    ]`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen i predict and the look in the probability I want that \"Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,Hospital\" will give the same probability as \"Machine Learning,Hospital,Artificial Intelligence\", because the categories are completely the same but that is not the case.\r\n\r\nI look in it like that:\r\n`prediction = model.predict(dataset=test_df, gpus=[0])`\r\n`print(prediction[0]['label_probabilities'])`\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu\r\n - Version 19.10\r\n- Python 3.7.5\r\n- Ludwig 0.3.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAs I said it could be that i misunderstood the \"set\" feature but maybe then you can help me to use it correctly.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"donfour10","id":55831555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODMxNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55831555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10","html_url":"https://github.com/donfour10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
