I thought that supplying the values for y1 to y24 will be used to test the predictions that are supposed to be made for these outputs (y1 to y24).\r\n\r\nAfter that I issued:\r\n```\r\nludwig visualize --visualization learning_curves --training_statistics ./results/experiment_run_2/training_statistics.json \r\n```\r\nAnd I got plots for each output, but the validation line was flat zero...why is that?\r\nAnd where can I see the actual numerical predictions? something simple like:\r\ny24 value: 43\r\ny24 pred: 40\r\netc.\r\n\r\nLast, I have to say that the visualization part is very non-intuitive. It would be nice to see a long example for a use-case with all the visualization arguments used in the user guide.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
