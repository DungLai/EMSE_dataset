This is also true if the ludwig cli is used as shown in the notebook in the last code block (I know, that it wont output plots, but it gives the same error).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Eb0WoJzH_lJx4dG10ZOa3MT_Z1hu_bPK\r\n2. Scroll down to last 3 code blocks \r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOne should see two plots (accuracy and loss)\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Google Colab\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Ludwig version: master (see first block in notebook)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
