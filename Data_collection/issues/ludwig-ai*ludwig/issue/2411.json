However, the transformer stack is only used if categorical input features are in the training data.  If there are no categorical features, the algorithm does not use the transformer stack.   In addition to allocating unneeded memory, this complicates the unit test for this combiner.\r\n\r\nProposed change is to refactor the constructor to allocate the transformer stack only if categorical features are present in the input features.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
