I have tried to install it several times through the steps on the website and no luck.\r\n\r\nI've downloaded Tensorflow 2.4.0-rc0 (the only one available for M1) separately as it wasn't getting anywhere through the \"pip install ludwig\" command. I kept getting dependency conflict errors and I corrected them for the most part but there seems to be no workaround for TF- see conflicts below.\r\n\r\nThe conflict is caused by:\r\n    ludwig 0.3.3 depends on tensorflow>=2.3.1\r\n    ludwig 0.3.2 depends on tensorflow>=2.3.1\r\n    ludwig 0.3.1 depends on tensorflow>=2.2\r\n    ludwig 0.3 depends on tensorflow>=2.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.8 depends on tensorflow==1.15.3\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.7 depends on tensorflow==1.15.3\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.6 depends on tensorflow==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.5 depends on tensorflow==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.4 depends on tensorflow==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.3 depends on tensorflow==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2.2 depends on tensorflow-gpu==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.2 depends on tensorflow-gpu==1.15.2\r\n    ludwig 0.2.1 depends on tensorflow==1.14.0\r\n    ludwig 0.2 depends on tensorflow==1.14.0\r\n    ludwig 0.1.2 depends on tensorflow==1.13.1\r\n    ludwig 0.1.1 depends on tensorflow==1.13.1\r\n    ludwig 0.1.0 depends on tensorflow>=1.12\r\n\r\nTo fix this you could try to:\r\n1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified\r\n2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict\r\n\r\nIt seems M1's limited TF availability is not letting the Ludwig install get through the TF dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSuccessfully install Ludwig.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Big Sur 11.2.1\r\n- Python 3.8\r\n- Ludwig 0.3.3\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"connor-mccorm","id":97468934,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9CBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97468934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm","html_url":"https://github.com/connor-mccorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
