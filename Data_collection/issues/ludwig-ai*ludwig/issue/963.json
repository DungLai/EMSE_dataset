Create any big model with \"set\" output feature (my case was multilabel (tags) classification with ~10000 train dataset) \r\n2. run \"predict\" on big dataset (~3000 rows to predict on and ~10000 tags in the `idx2str` dict after training)\r\n3. \"postprocess\" function will be executed for quite a long time (20-30 times longer than the prediction process itself)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIteration in \"postprocess\" can be done way faster if `numpy()` will be used for PREDICTIONS ([here](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/features/set_feature.py#L258), as well as it is already done for [PROBABILITIES](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/features/set_feature.py#L270)\r\n\r\nSimple code snippet to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\ndef print_now(msg):\r\n    print(datetime.datetime.now(), ': ', msg)\r\n    sys.stdout.flush()\r\n\r\npred_set_fake = tf.zeros([10000,], tf.int32)\r\nprint_now(pred_set_fake)\r\n\r\nprint_now('start 1')\r\nfor i, pred in enumerate(pred_set_fake):\r\n    1 + 1\r\nprint_now('end 1')\r\n\r\n\r\nprint_now('start 2')\r\nfor i, pred in enumerate(pred_set_fake.numpy()):\r\n    1 + 1\r\nprint_now('end 2')\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/data# python test_iter.py \r\n....\r\n2020-10-20 06:11:03.063242 :  tf.Tensor([0 0 0 ... 0 0 0], shape=(10000,), dtype=int32)\r\n2020-10-20 06:11:03.063733 :  start 1\r\n2020-10-20 06:11:04.344766 :  end 1\r\n2020-10-20 06:11:04.344881 :  start 2\r\n2020-10-20 06:11:04.347144 :  end 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.3 sec vs 0.003 sec...\r\n\r\nand since there are On^2 complexity (for in for), it is becoming a bottleneck in a whole \"predict\" method of the model...\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n- OS: tensorflow:2.3.0 docker image\r\n- Python version 3.6.9 in tensorflow:2.3.0 docker image\r\n- Ludwig version v0.3\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt probably can be relevant for other types of features as well, but since I am currently working with `set` only, I can't be 100% sure ","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/963/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
