Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, I think the stop condition for ludwig train job is if there's no more improvement after a few steps, then it's stopped. \r\nSometimes, I want to stop my job after xx minutes/hrs. Current policy is not flexible enough.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\n\r\nAs an end user, I hope I have multiple ways to stop the job or use a combined strategy.  To be concrete, I need `time_budget_s` in `ludwig train` as well, currently, it's just available in hypopt because underneath `ray.tune` provides it. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nHave an abstraction on Stop Condition or Policy.  Accuracy based or  Time based could be one of the implementations.  \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
