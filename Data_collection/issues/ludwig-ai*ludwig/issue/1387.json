There is therefore a chance that a split will not receive any data. That chance is magnified with very small datasets.\r\n\r\nI would either suggest reworking the algorithm completely to ensure that this can't happen, or, as a stop-gap measure, check that each split has at least one data shard, and if that is not the case, allocate one from the biggest split.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
