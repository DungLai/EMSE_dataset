The comet contrib integration contains some logging calls, for example, https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/contribs/comet.py#L56.\r\n\r\nThose calls happen before any `basicConfig` call https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/experiment.py#L461.\r\n\r\nThe issue with calling the root-level `logging.info`, `logging.error` and so on is that they will call `logging.basicConfig` on their own if the root logger is not configured yet https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L2065. The direct effect is that the first call to `logging.info` will configure the root logger with no configuration which will create a StreamHandler pointing to `/dev/stderr`.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate side-effect is that calling `basicConfig` will do nothing as the root handler as already a handler so the root logger will not be set to the right log level and the stream handler will not point to the right device.\r\n\r\nI would recommend moving from using the root logger and configure the logger through `basicConfig` to using a `ludwig` logger and configure it manually, it's not that more complex. I can help if wanted.\r\n\r\nOne last issue with using the root logger is when configuring the root logger to the debug level, all libraries which are logging will start displaying their log messages. That includes requests and is polluting the output. Using a separate logger would also solve this issue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
