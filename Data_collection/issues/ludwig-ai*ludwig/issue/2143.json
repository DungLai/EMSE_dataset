Note that both screenshots are from a separate experiment, I wanted to add them to give examples.\r\n\r\n**Findings**\r\n- The overall “best trial” according to hyperopt has a highest AUC of 0.79912. Digging deeper into the training stats for this trial, all evaluations (both val and test) are < 0.8\r\n- I looked deeper into the training stats for all trials, and actually did find the trial that had AUROC > 0.8. The highest val AUROC i saw was 0.80087. However, the hyperopt stats for this trial do not have this AUROC listed, and the “best reported” metric for this trial is 0.797168.\r\n- The metric used to select the best trial *and* the metric reported in the overall summary is Val AUROC\r\n- For the actual best trial, both test and val AUROC were > 0.8\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1\r\n<img width=\"856\" alt=\"Screen Shot #1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5787923/173699675-f8f045ba-6489-4e9c-8084-e7aa81521ebd.png\">\r\n\r\nScreenshot 2\r\n<img width=\"2560\" alt=\"Screen Shot #2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5787923/173699630-a52b9616-133c-4258-851f-dc873ee1fd10.png\">\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
