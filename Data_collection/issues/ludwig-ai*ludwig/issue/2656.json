In particular, one directory name in the path is composed of the experiment name and model type, but it is not obvious that this is the case, making it difficult to reconstruct the filepath.\r\n\r\nUse Case: A user wants to create a custom hyperopt trial logger with either a callback or a reporter. The `tune.trials.Trial` objects representing trials in the experiment do not point to the Ludwig output directory, leaving some data inaccessible.\r\n\r\nSolution: It would be nice to have a single function call (possibly through the artifact manager) that, provided model or trial metadata, returns the path to the output directory.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
