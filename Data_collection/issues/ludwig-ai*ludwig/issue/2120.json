Please describe.**\r\nThis relates to clarifying the scope of the dtype `date`\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nThe data type `date` typically use used for date only that do not contain any time component.  Given `date` type in ludwig does allow an optional time component, suggest renaming this to \"datetime\" that matches the specification [ISO 8061](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRefactor all references to [DATE](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/constants.py#L29) constant to refer to a new `DATETIME` value.\r\n\r\nAlso add backwards compatbility for mapping to old configurations, perhaps this could be done when [inferring types](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/automl/base_config.py#L331).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2120/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
