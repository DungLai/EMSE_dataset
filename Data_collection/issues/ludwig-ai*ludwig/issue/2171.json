This will help add search spaces more concisely for datasets with a large number of features while also reducing the search space to allow for a deeper search during hyperopt.\r\n\r\nFor e.g., a user should be able to add\r\n\r\n`\"defaults.input_features.text.cell_type\": {\"space\": \"choice\", \"categories\": [\"lstm\", \"gru\"]}`\r\n\r\nin their hyperopt search space so that all text input features use the sampled cell_type for that particular trial.\r\n\r\nThe API for this change will be as follows: `defaults.<feature_group>.<feature_type>.<parameter>`, where:\r\n\r\n- `feature_group`: either input_features or output_features to distinguish which features to apply this to\r\n- `feature_type`: the feature type in question, for e.g., text/category/sequence etc.\r\n- `parameter`: the parameter that one wants to search over for that particular feature type, for e.g., vocab_size for text\r\n\r\nExample Configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhyperopt:\r\n    goal: minimize\r\n    parameters:\r\n        trainer.learning_rate:\r\n            lower: 0.0001\r\n            upper: 0.01\r\n            space: loguniform\r\n        defaults.input_features.text.cell_type:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [\"lstm\", \"rnn\", \"gru\"]\r\n        defaults.output_features.category.vocab_size:\r\n            space: randint\r\n            lower: 4\r\n            upper: 8\r\n        ....\r\n    ....\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
