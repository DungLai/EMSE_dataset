Great job, as always.\r\n\r\nI came across some strange behavior when training with multiple GPUs using Horovod in an image classification problem. When training on a single GPU (w/o) horovod I get an accuracy <1 that progresses toward 1 during training. So far so good. Now, when I use Horovod this accuracy somewhat scales with the number of GPUs I am using. E.g. it seems to add up the accuracy from each GPU. (With two GPUs the accuracy converges to 2, with three GPU to 3 and so on).\r\n\r\nMy question is simple: is this a bug or a feature?\r\n\r\nSingle GPU training:\r\n\r\n```ludwig train --dataset annotation_200pxl.csv --config_file model_definition_std_cnn.yaml```\r\n\r\nMulti GPU training:\r\n\r\n```horovodrun -np 2 ludwig train --dataset annotation_200pxl.csv --config_file model_definition_std_cnn.yaml```\r\n\r\nwith a configuration file that reads:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: image_path\r\n        type: image\r\n        encoder: resnet\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: class\r\n        type: category\r\n\r\ntraining:\r\n    reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau: 10\r\n    early_stop: 10\r\n    learning_rate: 0.0004\r\n    batch_size: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the feedback\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"connor-mccorm","id":97468934,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9CBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97468934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm","html_url":"https://github.com/connor-mccorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
