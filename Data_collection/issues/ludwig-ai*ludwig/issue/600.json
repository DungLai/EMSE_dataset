Please describe.**\r\nWould like to know if there's a quick way to disable a feature without having to modify csv and the model file. \r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nI have a use case with many columns, some of which may be either redundant or not contributing to the model. In a random forest world, I would've looked for feature importance and trim the feature columns. Would be great if there's a simple way to enable spot disabling to get runs. For example, I imagine some override parameter disable somewhere (model config or the main script) to disable a specific column for quick tries.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\ndisable parameter in the model config\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRebuild csv and model file after removing specific columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mangleddata","id":57873718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODczNzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57873718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata","html_url":"https://github.com/mangleddata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
