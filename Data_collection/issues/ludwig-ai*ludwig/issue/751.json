I have added and removed multiple features trying to track down the cause with no luck. Some of the results I receive are numeric, some are not, and some files just repeat the same result. \r\nChanging the inputs to category resolves the issue and I am fairly certain using sequential inputs work as well (tested previously).\r\n\r\nI do not understand the difference between the results in runs 19 & 20. I would expect the files created in run 20 to mimic the previous files...i.e. run 19 accident_output returns mixed results but run 20 accident_output are all numeric. \r\n\r\nI am attaching the results from three experiments. \r\nFirst run (19) is a basic numeric to numeric and the data file was created by copying and pasting the data into a new csv file. \r\nSecond run (20) are same files with no changes except for using the hdf files created by run19. I didn't even closed the command prompt. \r\nThird run I changed the inputs to category and received all numeric outputs as expected.
