Generally, we have more than one feature per time step, and thus I structure my data as such:\r\n\r\n`[[[1,2], [2, 1]], [[3, 4], [2, 6]]]`\r\n\r\nwhere the dimensions are `number_of_timesteps * number_of_features * sample_size`, so in this case we have a sample of two, each with two time steps and two features at each time step. Is it possible to model this using Ludwig, and if so, how would I structure my pandas dataframe to be able to properly process this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
