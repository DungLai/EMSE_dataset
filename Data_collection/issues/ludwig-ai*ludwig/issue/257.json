I have a simple prototype that involves annotating the search space directly in the model yaml file.  However.... i had to comment out this statement on line 388 in model.py\r\n\r\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self.set_epochs_to_1_or_quit)\r\n\r\nI think the problem is related to the fact that RAY will build and train each permutation of the model outside in a separate thread and signal handlers in python must be run in main thread (I am not a python expert)\r\n\r\n\r\nJust food for thought.  It looks like the signal handler allows for more graceful shutdown in the event of a failure, which i can live without.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
