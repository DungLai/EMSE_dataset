Please describe.**\r\nI am unable to get ludwig test to product results on the entire dataset. Not sure if I am missing something or needs a new feature to disable split.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nDataset is trained using individual train/valid/test csv (i.e via ludwig train --data_train_csv train.csv  --data_validation_csv valid.csv  --data_test_csv  test.csv -mdf model_definition.yaml ). Now I want to look into the statistics of test.csv (say using ludwig test  --data_csv test_with_split.csv --train_set_metadata_json train.json -m results/experiment_run_4/model/ -s full). test_with_split.csv is the same file as test.csv with an added column 'split' set to 2. This always returns only a subset of data. test_with_split.csv has 50K lines, while the predictions inside results dir is ~12K data points. \r\n\r\nI've tried using ludwig predict with --evaluate_performance, but it looks like it isn't supported [ludwig predict: error: unrecognized arguments: --evaluate_performance]\r\n\r\nDoc states \"If the argument --evaluate_performance if provided, a predict_statistics.json file containing all prediction statistics will also be outputted\"\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf ludwig test can simply take a file and output all the predictions with test statistics, it would be great (or a simple way to avoid split column)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI might have to handroll the predictions, but would rather use the awesome statistics already provided. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"karthikkrishnanv","id":3976999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzY5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3976999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv","html_url":"https://github.com/karthikkrishnanv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthikkrishnanv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
