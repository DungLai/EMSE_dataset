`.iloc[0:4000]` (i.e. a very small sub-sample) doesn't run into this error, so I assume this error has to do with the size of the data.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI can't share the file since it's proprietary information, if you don't have a large dataset handy to replicate I can generate one locally and write the code to replicate then update here.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIdeally, I'd expect ludwig to handle dataframes and files the same way.\r\n\r\nRealistically, I guess this might be hard, but it might be easy to make the above error more explicit in telling the user that whatever happened was due to size.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n(Note, tried on multiple operating system, initially the bug was encountered on ubuntu
