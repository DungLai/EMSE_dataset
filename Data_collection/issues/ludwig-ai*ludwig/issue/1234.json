I'm trying to complete an example in the getting started guide, but I'm stuck when it comes to getting predictions to work.\r\n\r\nI'm using the `epinions-1.csv` (CSV file with a `class` and a `text` column) as suggested in the getting started guide and I'm running Ludwig using the official Docker container. The following is my configuration.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n- name: text\r\n  type: text\r\n  level: word\r\n  encoder: parallel_cnn\r\noutput_features:\r\n- name: class\r\n  type: category\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst off I start training using the `experiment` command. That seems to work and outputs a model. However when I try to use the following `predict` command on **the same data** with the `class` column removed (same CSV, just a single column), I don't get any CSVs with predictions as the docs seem to indicate I should. `prediction.shapes.json` contains an empty object and the NPY files also seem empty when loaded with `numpy.load`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nludwig predict --dataset /data/epinions-1-text.csv --data_format csv --model_path /data/results/experiment_run/model --output_directory /data/predictions\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong? Thanks! üôè\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @ianmuscat in https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/discussions/1229_","closed_by":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1234/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
