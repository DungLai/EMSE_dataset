Please describe.**\r\nI am not able to evaluate a model validation loss history and\\or track the model validation loss evolution when not having access to the CLI and have to rely to the train_reg_mean_loss graph to deduce what the validation loss could be trending to. I often find myself with a continuously improving training loss, but a stuck validation loss (hence, the model is not getting better and not being saved).\r\nI can only find out about this when looking at the CLI and finding out that there has not been an improvement in the last X epochs. Being able to see the validation loss graph not having improved in the last X epochs could lead me to stop the training and try a different approach, without having to in any case remote into the training machine, but allowing for a web-based \"diagnostic\".\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nBeing able to track validation loss from the existing TensorBoard interface, since when having small datasets and not having the capability to augment input data, the validation set (thus the validation loss) could become a very separate thing from the training set (and its loss value).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdding the validation loss measure already calculated in the CLI as a tf.summary output, alongside the existing train_reg_mean_loss","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
