In this way, we can ensure that following a release we only pull in specific bugfixes to net improve stability.\r\n\r\nHere is the process:\r\n\r\n1. When Ludwig master branch is “feature complete” for the next planned minor version bump, we cut a new branch: release-0.X.\r\n2. If there are bugfixes for Ludwig, they are merged to master and then cherry-picked into the release-0.X branch.\r\n3. Once the release-0.X branch is considered to be stable, we publish the release to PyPi.\r\n4. If there are needed hotfixes, we cherry-pick the fixes from master and tag the next patch release version from the same release-0.X branch.\r\n5. New features are still committed to Ludwig master branch, and we repeat from (1) once the next release is feature complete.","closed_by":{"login":"dalianaliu","id":33500844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTAwODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33500844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu","html_url":"https://github.com/dalianaliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalianaliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
