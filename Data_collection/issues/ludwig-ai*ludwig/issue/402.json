And loss does not increase at all even after 15 epochs. My test dataset is the dogs vs cats Kaggle dataset which has around 12k of each.\r\n\r\nPlease provide code, yaml definition file and a sample of data in order to entirely reproduce the issue.\r\nIssues that are not reproducible will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe model_definition file is as follows. I've tried several different learning rates, batch sizes, dropouts and resent sizes (34, 50)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: image_path\r\n        type: image\r\n        encoder: resnet\r\n        resnet_size: 50\r\n        dropout: true\r\n        preprocessing:\r\n          resize_method: interpolate\r\n          height: 224\r\n          width: 224\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: label\r\n        type: category\r\n\r\ntraining:\r\n    batch_size: 16\r\n    learning_rate: 0.01\r\n    dropout_rate: 0.5\r\n    epochs: 25\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect to see a decrease in loss with each epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\nI attached all the screenshots\r\n[Screenshots and files.zip](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/files/3337131/Screenshots.and.files.zip)\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Version: 10\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Ludwig version: 0.1.2\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
