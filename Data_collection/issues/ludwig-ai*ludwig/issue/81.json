It seems like when loading the model_definition_file, Ludwig is using `yaml.load`, which, according to the [pyyaml documentation](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation), takes a byte string, a Unicode string, an open binary file object, or an open text file object. However, the ludwig documentation says that model_definition_file should be a file path. I tried passing in an open file object and it works. \r\n\r\nI think either the documentation needs to be changed or the model initialization should be modified to actually take a file path instead.
