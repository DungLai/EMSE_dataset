I think the problem is probably from the dataset? the first column is empty. it should be `movie_id` but seems it's missing (I think this feature is not helpful at all? should we just remove it from dataset). then the inference server think it misses one feature. The tricky thing is I don't know if how serve works with empty feature name? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/blob/master/docs/data/rotten_tomatoes_test.csv\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. train rotten_tomato.csv\r\n2. run `ludwig serve --model_path=/automl/model`\r\n3. run prediction request\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl http://0.0.0.0:8000/predict -X POST -F \"movie_title=Friends With Money\" -F \"content_rating=R\" -F \"genres=Art House & International, Comedy, Drama\" -F \"runtime=88.0\" -F \"top_critic=TRUE\" -F \"review_content=The cast is terrific, the movie isn't.\"\r\n{\"error\":\"entry must contain all input features\"}%\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoc: https://ludwig.ai/0.6/getting_started/serve/\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should return 200 request with correct prediction result. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Python version 3.8.13\r\n- Ludwig version 0.6\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
