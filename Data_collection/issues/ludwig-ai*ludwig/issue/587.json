(since I can't use ROC curve for binary problems or confusion matrix for labeling problems)\r\n\r\nAt the same context, for the case that there is no prediction performance measurments avalible for numeric problems, and say I calculate the MSE (of my predictions vs. the pre-known correspondoing outputs), In order that this MSE value would have any meaning I must have some a-priory knowledge of the lack of fit of the model. \r\nThougth maybe I could  get this by looking at  \"train_batch_mean_squared_error_T_out2 \" graph for example(screenshot linked). Would like to make sure that this graph is indeed relavent for this purpose:\r\n It means that in epochs 15 the MSE was 1.06e-4? This MSE is relative to what? Here, when training in each epochs the model \"predict\" different output until its close enogh to the output given to the model for its training? so this graph is a good measure to the lack of fitting of the model?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51758806/69967012-3b861080-1520-11ea-940a-7b2e553d5f27.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
