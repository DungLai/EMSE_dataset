I have test and train the dataset separately. I read the documentation (https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/user_guide/#experiment), according to documentation Ludwig experiment command combines training and evaluation into a single command. So I used the following command to run the experiment:\r\nludwig experiment --data_set train_set.csv -cf model_definition.yml --output_directory results -kf=10\r\n\r\nThe above command generated two json files (i.e. kfold_split_indices and kfold_training_statistics).\r\n\r\nTo predict/test  the test dataset, I am not sure how to use the json files generated by the above command. I think I should use predict command to use the train model on the test data. So I wrote the following command:\r\n\r\nludwig predict --data_set test.csv --model_path 'path of json file' \r\n\r\nBut the above command did not test the data. \r\n\r\nCould you please help me where am I making the mistake?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"muhammad-yasir","id":25621662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjIxNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25621662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammad-yasir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
