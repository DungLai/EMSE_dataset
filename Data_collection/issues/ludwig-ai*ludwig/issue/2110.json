The differences are smallâ€“ around O(1e-6) at worst, more often < O(1e-8).\r\n\r\nThis is odd because both LudwigModel and Torchscript call the same function: `AudioFeatureMixin._transform_to_feature`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n`tests/integration_tests/test_torchscript.py::test_torchscript_e2e` is flaky due to audio feature. \r\n1. Comment out all features besides the audio feature.\r\n2. Run it a few times and eventually `assert np.allclose` will fail.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLudwigModel outputs and Torchscript outputs should be the same.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Version: 12.3.1\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Ludwig version: `master` @ `c35df1c570444556c38a79d733ed9e5344699c3c`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"geoffreyangus","id":29719151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29719151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus","html_url":"https://github.com/geoffreyangus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
