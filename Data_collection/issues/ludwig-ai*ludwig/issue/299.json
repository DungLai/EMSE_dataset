My model features configuration is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"input_features\": [ {\"name\": \"lyrics_body\", \r\n                        \"type\": \"text\" , \r\n                        \"encoder\": \"rnn\", \r\n                        \"cell\": \"lstm\", \r\n                        \"bidirectional\": \"true\"} ], \r\n\r\n\r\n    \"output_features\": [\r\n                            {\"name\": \"valence\", \r\n                            \"type\": \"numerical\"  }, \r\n\r\n                            {\"name\": \"arousal\", \r\n                            \"type\": \"numerical\" }\r\n\r\n                        ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is: for text I give in input, do I have to normalize it, or this task is implemented inside? Do you think it could help improving performance of regressor?\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
