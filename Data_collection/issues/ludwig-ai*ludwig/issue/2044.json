The base class' forward pass serves as a thin wrapper around the real forward pass, which is defined by subclass' the `logits()` method.\r\n\r\nThis is rather unusual for PyTorch modules, which usually define their own `forward()`.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of this design is that the boilerplate code that unpacks combiner outputs into a representation that can be fed to an output_feature's decoder object, as well as the code that prepares the decoder object's outputs into the final tensors that are passed to prediction, are consolidated into a single location.\r\n\r\nHowever, a more canonical design would be to have the boilerplate operations factored out into separate libraries (i.e. feature_utils.py), and have each output feature call these methods, as needed, in their own `forward()`. This is also more canonical pytorch and more flexible -- output features like sequence or text features may have other more customized ways to unpack combiner tensors.\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n```python\r\nclass LudwigModule(BaseClass):\r\n  def logits(tensor):\r\n    return stuff(tensor)\r\n\r\n  def other_method():\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass BaseClass:\r\n  def forward(tensor):\r\n    tensor = prep_input_tensor(tensor)\r\n    tensor = self.logits(tensor) # Calls the subclass implementation, which is confusing.\r\n    return prep_output_tensor(tensor)\r\n\r\n  @abstractmethod\r\n  def logits(tensor): -> tensor\r\n    raise NotImplementedError()\r\n\r\n  @abstractmethod\r\n  def other_method():\r\n    raise NotImplementedError()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is better:\r\n```python\r\nclass LudwigModule(BaseClass):\r\n  def forward(tensor):\r\n    tensor = prep_input_tensor(tensor)\r\n    tensor = stuff(tensor)\r\n    return prep_output_tensor(tensor)\r\n\r\nclass BaseClass:\r\n  @abstractmethod\r\n  def other_method():\r\n    raise NotImplementedError()\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
