In particular, it seems like Ludwig can't build a vocabulary in the scenario where the categorical output has type `int64` instead of `str`. This happens when I pass in my dataset as a Pandas dataframe. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior: \r\n\r\n1. Download the jupyter notebook and wine quality dataset in this pull request: https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/2333\r\n2. Remove the following line of code `train_df['quality'] = train_df['quality'].astype(str)` and run the entire notebook.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLudwig should be able to build a vocab for the categorical output feature even if the column has distinct integers. It should cast to str internally if needed during preprocessing, or let the user know that they should cast the column to a string.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: \\[e.g. iOS\\] MacOS 12.4\r\n- Python version: 3.8.13\r\n- Ludwig version 0.6.dev","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
