There is only a self.reshape_features, which does not seem to be compatible with `IterableBatcher`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSee my code on petfinder dataset: https://github.com/zhisbug/ludwig-petfinder/blob/master/petfinder-adoption-prediction/train.py#L11\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI guess a fix is needed to make IteratableBatcher compatible with ParquetDataset?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Ludwig version: master\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
