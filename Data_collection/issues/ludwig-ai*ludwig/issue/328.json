I'm talking about <0.01 loss in tensorflow and >300 loss in CLI.\r\nThis is not happening using a stacked_cnn encoder of any size\\shape\r\nInput image is sized 300x300x1 (grayscale). I know that's not an optimal input, but that's what I'm working with.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI don't know the specifics of how to repro the issue, since I'm not able to get a \"working\" example. It's only happening using resnet encoding, and I tried with the simplest one, of size 8 and with all the default values.\r\nHere's the YAML\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: ImageFile\r\n        type: image\r\n        encoder: resnet\r\n        resnet_size: 8\r\n        num_filters: 16\r\n        kernel_size: 3\r\n        conv_stride: 1\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: Type\r\n        type: category\r\ntraining:\r\n        batch_size: 64\r\n        learning_rate: 0.0001\r\n        epochs: 100\r\n        early_stop: 30\r\n        decay: true\r\n        validation_measure: loss\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCLI values and TensorFlow Logs values to be at least similar (I understand there are some aggregations performed, but they're in two completely different directions)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4464640/57237685-02d49600-7028-11e9-81a0-989f91f77766.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4464640/57237708-0f58ee80-7028-11e9-8f68-1e410fd59172.png)\r\n(orange is batch size 32, blue is batch size 64.
