Softmax outputs are not generally well-calibrated confidence scores.\r\n\r\nHowever, they can be calibrated for many datasets by simply scaling the logits by a temperature T (tempered softmax).  T can be chosen after training by minimizing NLL.\r\n\r\nSo, we could add a post-processing phase for binary and categorical output features which learns a value for T which minimizes NLL, as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599\r\n\r\nThis learned T could be stored in the model metadata and used to generate calibrated confidence scores at predict time.","closed_by":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
