Please describe.**\r\nCSV and HDF5 is not good to deal with  a large data like millions of images. Technically, we can store a large number of images in machine(s). However, it is not good when we want to do experiments with different parameters in parallel.\r\n\r\nWith modern tensorflow, it would be great to load data with TFRecord especially google cloud storage. So, we should not store datasets in machines physically.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nIf we can read a large data with TFRecord as stream especially on google cloud storage, we can casually run experiments on anywhere. We don't need to care about how to prepare datasets on machines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great to support TFRecord data type. And reading TFRecord files on GCS directly would be best.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI don't have any alternate solution.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
