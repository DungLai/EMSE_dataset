I check the speed of training (from https://kashgari.bmio.net/tutorial/text-labeling/#performance-report) is 200 seconds with one GPU. But my training process need 3 hours one epoch with same one gpu.\r\nIn order to find the reason of it, I add 4 GPU to train the same model, and it still 3 hours one epoch. So I think the training process didn't use gpu. How to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe specific of training process:\r\nGPU:k80 (1 or 4)\r\nsystem: google cloud platform\r\nfirst, I use tensorflow-gpu docker(1.14.0) and installed ludwig then running following command:\r\nludwig experiment \\\r\n  --data_csv sequence_tags.csv \\\r\n  --model_definition_file model_definition.yaml\r\nsecond, I doubt maybe I need to install  Horovod and the required packages, after finishing the installation. running:\r\nludwig experiment \\\r\n  --data_csv sequence_tags.csv \\\r\n  --model_definition_file model_definition.yaml -uh -g 0,1\r\nThere's no differences between the above two methods.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
