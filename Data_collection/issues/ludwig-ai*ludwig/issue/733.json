I've been trying the comet.ml integration and I must say this has been a great addition to the framework. ðŸ™Œ\r\n\r\nI wanted to exploit it to keep track of the learning rate updates, but the lr being plot is not the one that I expected, especially when trying the learning_rate_warmup_epochs option, which I set to 6 as suggested. The learning rate that is plot on comet is the one set in learning_rate, and it's constant for the first epochs.\r\n\r\nCould this be related to this error?\r\n\r\n`COMET ERROR: Failed to extract parameters from Optimizer.init()\r\n`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Setup comet\r\n2. Set  learning_rate_warmup_epochs option to 6\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected to see the lr increase in the first 6 epochs, reach the lr set in learning_rate, and eventually decrease, as I set also reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau .\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe lr is equal to the set learning_rate in the first epochs, and eventually decreases due to reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau .\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
