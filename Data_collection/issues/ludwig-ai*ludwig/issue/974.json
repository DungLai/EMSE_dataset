Please describe.**\r\nUber/Ludwig wishes to enhance its support for time series modeling and analysis. While there are many existing time series available for downloading, such as the LA Weather Archive used in a Ludwig TS example, a 'self-contained' Ludwig application would offer many benefits as a test bed for TS analysis with Ludwig, including comparison of various tools and methods. \r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the use case for this feature is.\r\nIncorporating user-configurable time series into Ludwig integrated with its various TS tools and methods, such as sequencing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI have developed Python code, based on the [Mackey-Glass equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackey-Glass_equations]), which supports creating simulated (AKA 'synthetic') time series of any length and configuration (e.g., univariate, multivariate with user-defined prediction horizons). MG time series are designed to be chaotic and thus present a challenging test-bed for TS analysis and prediction and so should support creation of robust solutions. I would be happy to contribute my code and/or support Uber staff to incorporate it into Ludwig.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIntegrate Ludwig with the University of California-Irving Machine Learning [Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=ts&sort=nameUp&view=table), which includes over 100 time series collected from around the world.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe proposed application could also be used to support development and testing of new Ludwig TS tools and methods.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/974/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
