Please describe.**\r\nIt seems as if numerical inputs for Ludwig do not get normalized to zero mean and a standard deviation of one. I have to preprocess the data manually before and keep the statistics of the inputs to normalize unseen data.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nUseful for all users that deal with numerical data.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like an option in the preprocessing setting of the model dict to normalize inputs and store the statistics in the final model file. So if I predict new data I do not have to do any manual normalization steps before.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nG\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
