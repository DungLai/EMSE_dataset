I personally tried it `import dask.dataframe as dd; dataset_df = dd.read_csv('s3://bucket/myfiles.*.csv')` but notice I have to handle `s3fs` (required by dask). Is this a right way or there's easier way?\r\n2. I also notice dataset accepts string. I am using minio for testing and could I know if it supports minio here?
