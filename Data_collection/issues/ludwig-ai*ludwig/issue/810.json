Please describe.**\r\nRequest is to address a temporary work-around in dealing with the situation in the `SequenceConcatCombiner` class where `main_sequence_feature=None`.  Current work around is to check tensor rank to determine if it is a  sequence or not.  It is better to have a more explicit test that checks feature `type` value.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCurrently encoder output looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   'input_feature_name': {\r\n        'encoder_output': <encoded tensor>\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRequested enhancement is to add `type` key to the dictionary, as shown\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   'input_feature_name': {\r\n        'encoder_output': <encoded tensor>,\r\n        'type': <input feature type>\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs noted above, the current work-around to fix an issue in the `SequenceConcatCombiner` is testing tensor rank.  This may not be sufficient in general considering the variety of input features that Ludwig supports\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
