In Ludwig 0.5 a clear error was returned to indicate the problem but now only a `keyError` is raised, flummoxing a user trying to debug the problem.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Run adult census income example https://ludwig.ai/latest/examples/adult_census_income/\r\n2. Change an input feature name\r\n3. Wait for error.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise error message.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOriginal Slack discussion: https://ludwig-ai.slack.com/archives/C01PN6M2RSM/p1670612946929589\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2832/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
