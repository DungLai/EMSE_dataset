There is some small work that needs to be done on the Ray side to unblock the `to_torch` function for this scenario, but sounds like it's only a small amount of work.\r\n\r\n@noyoshi @clarkzinzow","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
