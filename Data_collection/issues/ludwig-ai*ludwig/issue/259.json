I'm using type: numerical for all the inputs and outputs. However as I understand 'numerical' type encompasses floating values, hence on prediction I get float values as output. Is there any encoder/decoder that I can use to map those float output values to the nearest integer output values? My sincerest thanks in advance! I've used ludwig for last 3 weeks now, I'm really enjoying it.
