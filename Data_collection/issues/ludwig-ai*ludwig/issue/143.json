Here's another one.\r\n\r\nI want to distribute my training onto 2 GPUs on a single machine. I did install Horovod and the required packages successfully.\r\n\r\nNow, I thought that \r\n\r\n```\r\nludwig train --data_csv annotations_350x150.csv --model_definition \"[...]\" -uh -g 0,1\r\n```\r\nwould allow for that. Instead I get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nludwig train: error: argument -g/--gpus: invalid int value: '0,1'\r\n```\r\nI can use the same synthax (-g 1 or -g 0) to run the training on either card. So the devices are all properly visible. \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tboo","id":19666785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo","html_url":"https://github.com/tboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
