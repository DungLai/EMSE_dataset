I'm using the following data and config file:\r\n\r\nx, x_feature\r\n9.8,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n9.8,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n10.0,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n7.2,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n8.4,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n9.9,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n9.5,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n9.3,9.8 9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5\r\n9.2,9.8 10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5 9.3\r\n9.7,10.0 7.2 8.4 9.9 9.5 9.3 9.2\r\n\r\nconfig.yaml\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: x_feature\r\n        type: timeseries\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: x\r\n        type: numerical\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the model is returning results to the likes of \"array([10.050287, 10.050287], dtype=float32)\" in a numpy file. \r\n\r\nSo, a couple of questions:\r\n- What do these correspond to? Are they predictions of the next number that follows the sequence? If so, which one of the 10 sequences/x_features?\r\n- Why was I given two numbers when there was only one output feature?\r\n\r\nAny guidance here is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jppgks","id":11156808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU2ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11156808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks","html_url":"https://github.com/jppgks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jppgks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
