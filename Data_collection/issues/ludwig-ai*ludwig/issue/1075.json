I believe overwriting all the model parameters when pretrained model is loaded could be improved. Here's the scenario.\r\nRun 1: Run 100 epochs, set early_stop to be say 10 epochs. Model file is ready now.\r\nRun 2: New data and new model file, but the only change in the model is setting early_stop to be 2 epochs say. Current implementation would simply override the training parameters and can keep running for 100 epoch or early stop: 10 is reached.\r\n\r\nAllowing few parameters such as number of epochs or early stop values to be modified will save time in subsequent runs. I am right now modifying the model_hyperparameters.json file from run 1 to accomplish the same effect. When slow learning rate is used, each epoch can take a lot of time - so earlier stop values on subsequent runs could be helpful.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
