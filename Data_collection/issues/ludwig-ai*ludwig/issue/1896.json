Please describe.**\r\nNot related to a problem.  This is a usability improvement.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nTwo visualizations (roc_curves and binary_threshold_vs_metric) require the `positive_label` parameter if the output feature is a `category` type.  Currently `positive_label` is defined as \"positive_label must be an integer, to find the integer label associated with a class check the ground_truth_metadata JSON file\". \r\n\r\nThis requires the user to view `training_set_metadata.json` to determine the integer value associated with the desired category by viewing the `str2idx` entry.  For example, if the desired positive class is \"Female\", the `positive_label` will be 2.\r\n\r\nHere is an excerpt of a `category` feature from `training_set_metadta.json`:\r\n```\r\n    \"sex\": {\r\n        \"idx2str\": [\r\n            \"<UNK>\",\r\n            \" Male\",\r\n            \" Female\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"preprocessing\": {\r\n            \"computed_fill_value\": \"<UNK>\",\r\n            \"fill_value\": \"<UNK>\",\r\n            \"lowercase\": false,\r\n            \"missing_value_strategy\": \"fill_with_const\",\r\n            \"most_common\": 10000\r\n        },\r\n        \"str2freq\": {\r\n            \" Female\": 16192,\r\n            \" Male\": 32650,\r\n            \"<UNK>\": 0\r\n        },\r\n        \"str2idx\": {\r\n            \" Female\": 2,\r\n            \" Male\": 1,\r\n            \"<UNK>\": 0\r\n        },\r\n        \"vocab_size\": 3\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nA futher complication is that ordering of category classes, which affects the index value, is based on frequency of the category class.   This is from the `category` feature documentation, \"Categories are mapped to integers by first collecting a dictionary of all unique category strings present in the column of the dataset, ranking them descending by frequency and assigning a sequential integer ID from the most frequent to the most rare (with 0 assigned to the special unknown placeholder token <UNK>). \"\r\n\r\nIf the model is re-trained with new data and if the relative frequency of the classes are different, then the index value for a class will change.  For the example shown, if \"Female\" is the more frequent class in the new training, then `positive_label` will be 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInstead of `positive_label` representing an integer, a more user friendly approach is to use class label string, i.e., `postitve_label` should be specified as \"Female\".  This is more understandable by the user and is stable regardless of the make up of the data.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
