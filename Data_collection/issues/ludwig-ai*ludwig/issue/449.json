This is possible using a framework like keras using layers such as ConvLSTM, Conv3D, etc. With Ludwig I see the image datatype only allows for 2D+channel data format as input.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if there is a way of achieving the above goal using the existing framework.\r\nIf yes, are there any documentation available? If no, is this a feature that will be considered for future updates?\r\n\r\nHappy to contribute!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
