I'm not sure what the problem is, but the loss I get for both resnet and stacked_cnn is extremely high. I'm talking int the billions! I see there was a new commit that solved this issue but it doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nRun a classification model using 'crop_or_pad' on Windows 10.\r\n\r\nPlease provide code, yaml definition file and a sample of data in order to entirely reproduce the issue.\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: image_path\r\n        type: image\r\n        encoder: stacked_cnn\r\n        preprocessing:\r\n          resize_method: interpolate\r\n          height: 224\r\n          width: 224\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: label\r\n        type: category\r\n\r\ntraining:\r\n    batch_size: 16\r\n    epochs: 25\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect loss to go down with training similar to the 'interpolate' resize method.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Ludwig version: 0.1.2\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TKassis","id":9168908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjg5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9168908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis","html_url":"https://github.com/TKassis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TKassis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
