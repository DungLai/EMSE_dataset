Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI've been cross checking the score_predictions.csv stored when running a Ludwig experiment with running the Ludwig predict from the CLI. I've been getting slightly different results in some cases and very different results in others.\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nIncluding the tensorflow version along with the Ludwig version would make it easier to re-create the environment a model was trained in.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInclusion of the version of tensorflow in the description.json file.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis may not be the solution to the inconsistent prediction results.
