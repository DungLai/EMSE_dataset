One thing is a little bit confused. I found two paths for the best persisted model.\r\n\r\n1. auto_train_results.path_to_best_model -> hyperopt/trail_63dfb25e/checkpoint_000360.\r\n2. after I get the best trail id, I find the artifacts associated with trail, in this case, model is `hyperopt/trail_63dfb25e/hyperopt_tabnet/model`\r\n\r\nSeem these two models are exact same? the only different file is `training_progress.json`. Not sure if it's because there's a `checkpoint_000361` (not the best model) so  `training_progress.json` in `hyperopt_tabnet/model` is different? \r\n\r\nCan someone help explain more details on the difference?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4739316/185842022-e00f4d3d-ccb8-4a64-b4ce-c0681c1e9ee6.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
