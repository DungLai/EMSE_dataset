Both A and B are of same size and the model file is exactly the same. However, the loading seems to fail due to memory issue [done via -mlp ${INIT_MODEL_PATH}  to ludwig train command ]. This seems strange because I would've though the loader should've simply worked since the dataset sizes are same. Any idea why it may be happening ? Does preloading this way needs twice as much memory for example ? The errors look like below\r\n\r\nE tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:828] failed to allocate 1.32G (1419129856 bytes) from device: CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY: out of memory\r\n\r\nAre there any workarounds possible ?
