This is the API for the `create_model` function:\r\n\r\n```def create_model(config_obj: ModelConfig, random_seed: int = default_random_seed) -> BaseModel:```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that it is a static method, but it expects a ModelConfig object which is only created in the LudwigModel constructor/initialization. This is a problem because this method is essentially not useful unless a LudwigModel object is first created and the config object is retrieved via `model.config_obj`.\r\n\r\nSome solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Allow this API to take a union of Dict, ModelConfig\r\n2. If the object is of type dict, create the ModelConfig object by doing `ModelConfig.from_dict(config_obj)` and reassign it","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
