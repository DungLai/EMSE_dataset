If the same experiment is run repeatedly, the trials get scheduled randomly across each of these three node types. This isn't ideal since I'd want training to happen only on the GPUs. \r\n\r\n**Ideal outcome**\r\nThe head node should be the main driver of hyperopt while each trial actually happens on the GPU workers. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
