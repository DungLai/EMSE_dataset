One is the final value, whereas the other one is an intermediate value, always smaller than the final one. Is there a way of telling Ludwig this relationship, besides defining a dependency?\r\n\r\n```\r\noutput_features:\r\n-\r\n name: final_value\r\n type: numerical\r\n- \r\n  name: intermediate_value\r\n  type: numerical\r\n  dependencies: \r\n   - final_value\r\n```\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n1. I saw that I can **_reduce_dependencies_**, but I'm not sure if this declaration should sit with the _intermediate_value_ or the _final_value_. \r\n\r\n2. A brief explanation of what _sum_, _mean_, _max_, _concat_, and _last_ do in this context would also be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n3. Bonus round: if I would have a third intermediate value (or more), should I make all of them dependent on the next measured value (1st_intermediate_value will depend on the 2nd_intermediate_value which will depend on the final_value)?\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nPS Sorry, I wouldn't have bothered you with these questions, but the link toward the community is broken. You should also be aware of a minor typo on your website: search for **_9second_** in the [User Guide](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/user_guide/). It should read **_(second_**. There are 13 occurrences of it.","closed_by":{"login":"humanID","id":15346241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ2MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15346241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID","html_url":"https://github.com/humanID","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humanID/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
