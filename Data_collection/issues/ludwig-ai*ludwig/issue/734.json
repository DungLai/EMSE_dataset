I also specify class weights to force it to be more aggressive in assigning the class `X`. (to be honest I am not sure, if it takes effect)\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)   \r\n   loss:\r\n      type: softmax_cross_entropy\r\n      class_weights:\r\n        X: 1.\r\n        O: 0.02\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat confuses me is that in the reports ludwig prints out I see the validation loss increase but ludwig reports that the loss improved (which I would assume would mean for it to decrese), saves the model and continues training. Does ludwig make the comparison on some different value than it prints out?\r\n\r\n```\r\n#  loss is in first numeric column\r\n\r\nEpoch   8\r\n────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n│ vali              │ 0.0885 │     0.3998 │           0.9671 │          0.9530 │       1.0925 │          0.0347 │\r\n├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────┼──────────────────┼\r\nValidation loss on combined improved, model saved\r\n\r\nEpoch   9\r\n─────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n│ vali              │ 0.0990 │     0.4143 │           0.9654 │          0.9542 │       1.1041 │          0.0363 │\r\n├───────────────────┼────────┼────────────┼──────────────────┼ \r\n Validation loss on combined improved, model saved\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nI cannot provide the data I train on, but I observed it frequently, so maybe it can be seen on some other dataset you test on. I may try to provide synthetic data in the future, but maybe the problem can be diagnosed without it just looking at the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSave the model and report improvement only when the validation loss truly decreses and it can be noticed in the console report.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. iOS]\r\nCentos7\r\n - Version [e.g. 22]\r\n- Python version\r\n3.6.8\r\n- Ludwig version\r\ncurrent master\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
