I wanted to check if I'm doing something wrong. Thanks in advance for your time!\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. I use the following command to run an experiment `ludwig experiment --experiment_name bert-uncaselarge --data_csv /path/to/mydataset.csv --model_definition_file /my/model_definition_bert.yaml`\r\n2. Here is the YAM file  'http://linkedvocabs.org/dataset/model_definition_bert.yaml'\r\n3. You can find the log after running the command here 'http://linkedvocabs.org/dataset/log-runningBert.txt\r\n4.
