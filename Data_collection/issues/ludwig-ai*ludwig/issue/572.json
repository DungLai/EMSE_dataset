Also, their structure is important so combining them to one file with a lot of data would lose the structer I want).\r\nAfter I have sucssesfully traind a model with the first of many .csv file, I would like to keep training the same model with the other files. \r\nI've seen in isse #71 that --model_load_path is better for me, so for example I tried\r\nludwig train  --data_csv C:/Users/user/Desktop/DataSet/SecondInputFile.csv --model_load_path C:/Windows/System32/results/experiment_run_12 (the path to the model that have been created by training with the first input file)\r\nbut I get the error \"ludwig train: error: one of the arguments -md/--model_definition -mdf/--model_definition_file is required\".\r\nI have tried many other constallations and none of them works.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/572/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
