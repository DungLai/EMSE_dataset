Please describe.**\r\nI am playing around with the Iris dataset to learn how to use Ludwig. I want to use the confusion matrix visualization (as an example). It was not too clear from the user guide which arguments were necessary and which arguments were optional. I initially kept getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\Scripts\\ludwig-script.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('ludwig==0.2.1', 'console_scripts', 'ludwig')()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\cli.py\", line 108, in main\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\cli.py\", line 64, in __init__\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\cli.py\", line 94, in visualize\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\visualize.py\", line 3119, in cli\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\visualize.py\", line 650, in confusion_matrix_cli        \r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\sriki\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\ludwig-0.2.1-py3.7.egg\\ludwig\\utils\\data_utils.py\", line 76, in load_json\r\nTypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType\r\n```\r\nbut I have since figured out that I was not specifying the `ground_truth_metadata` option. The problems are:\r\n\r\n1. The error message is not as informative as it can be.\r\n2. It was not straightforward (at least for me) which of the files was the correct input to this option. I did eventually figure it was `test_set_metadata.json`. \r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nThe use case is a person reading the documentation and trying to use one of the visualizations. In my case it was confusion matrix, but it could be any of them.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI think a walkthrough starting with a simple dataset would be quite helpful for a newcomer. Under visualization in user guide, start with this simple dataset. Then under each of the visualizations, after describing the CLI arguments, provide an example of how to use it.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nInformative error messages are one way to go. For example, instead of the error I received above, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou have not specified the ground_truth_metada argument for the confusion_matrix visualization.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAgain, this is probably an issue that only newcomers face, and is perhaps not that important for others. I am willing to help out if you think this is worth addressing.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
