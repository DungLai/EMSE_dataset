If you respect that, it should work right away.\r\nSo in the case of @Riz-waan , if your model definition was copied from the examples, with `user1` and `user2` as names of input and output feature respectively, both your training data csv and your test data csv must contain columns with those names (or you can change the `name` entries in your model definition with the names of the columns in your data).\r\nIn the case of @JacobBruce , if you trained with a text column named `test`, the same column needs to be present in your test data too.\r\nClosing this, let me know if you have further
