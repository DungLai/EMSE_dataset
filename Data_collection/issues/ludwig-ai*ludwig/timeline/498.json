ML requires tagging basically, so if you want to simply do an image classification identifying that that's a picture of a dog you just need to feed many images of dogs, tagged with some sort of \"dog\" keyword (alongside with non-dog images to have a negative example to learn from)\r\nIf you want to be object detection (ie: tracing a bounding box identifying not only that that's a picture of a dog, but exactly where the dog is in the picture) that gets more complicated but it's feasible.\r\nThere's a PR ( #344 ) in the works to add a bounding box feature, but that still would require tagged images, and a lot more of those needed for a simple classification.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/522880132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carlogrisetti","id":4464640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQ2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4464640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti","html_url":"https://github.com/carlogrisetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/523295364","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/498#issuecomment-523295364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/498","id":523295364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzI5NTM2NA==","user":{"login":"bobo04020802","id":998251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODI1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/998251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802","html_url":"https://github.com/bobo04020802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo04020802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T04:55:11Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T04:55:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ok，thank
