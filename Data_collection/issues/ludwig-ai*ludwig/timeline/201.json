Si esprime con ricchezza\\\\, eleganza e intensità\\\\, concedendo ampi sentori di frutta in confettura\\\\, spezie dolci\\\\, fiori rossi\\\\, grafite\\\\, pepe e liquirizia.

La mano di Marco Casolanetti per ciò che concerne la produzione di vino è una delle più riconoscibili\\\\, figlia di un'idea chiara che abbraccia il lavoro in vigna e in cantina. Marco\\\\, già proprietario di Oasi degli Angeli\\\\, opta per rese bassissime in pianta in modo da concentrare aromi e estratti in pochi frutti\\\\, raccolti a piena maturazione. Nel caso dell'Habemus i vitigni scelti sono Grenache\\\\, Syrah\\\\, Carignano e Tempranillo\\\\, tutti in grado di fornire un apporto aromatico generoso e ben delineato. Liquidi concentrati\\\\, profondi\\\\, impattanti\\\\, e di sicuro fascino e coinvolgimento\\\\, per la loro suadenza e piacevolezza di beva. Inutile dirlo\\\\, gli estimatori sono tanti e le bottiglie meno\\\\, pertanto conviene fare spazio in cantina! Il rosso Habemus Etichetta Bianca è ottenuto da un uvaggio costituito da Grenache\\\\, Syrah\\\\, Carignano e Tempranillo. Le uve\\\\, che vengono raccolte manualmente\\\\, sono frutto di una selezione accuratissima di vigne ad alberello piantate a 300-400 metri di altitudine su terreno argilloso con esposizione sud. La filosofia in vigna di Marco è da sempre volta al rispetto delle varietà e del sistema\\\\, pertanto le piante non vengono trattate con alcuna sostanza chimica o di sintesi. In cantina si prosegue con fermentazione spontanea in contenitori d'acciaio e affinamento per 20 mesi in barrique nuove\\\\, seguito da almeno 6 mesi in bottiglia. Il vino Habemus Etichetta Bianca si palesa nel calice con colore rosso rubino estremamente cupo ed impenetrabile. Naso ampissimo\\\\, su cui un degustatore particolarmente in forma potrebbe soffermarsi ore: cacao\\\\, tabacco\\\\, prugna\\\\, cannella\\\\, pepe nero tratteggiano quello che è un vero e proprio tripudio aromatico. L'assaggio non è da meno\\\\, ed è da vero cavallo di razza. Potenza\\\\, ricchezza e concentrazione\\\\, in un equilbrio mirabile tra parte estrattiva e freschezza. Lunghissimo il finale\\\\, per quello che è un liquido quasi da meditazione\\\\, o da bere in occasioni importanti. Garanzia! Colore Rosso rubino concentrato Profumo Ampio\\\\, nobile e complesso\\\\, con sentori di frutti di bosco in confettura\\\\, fiori rossi\\\\, spezie dolci\\\\, grafite\\\\, pepe e liquirizia Gusto

For the api, I think it's not really a problem as you can provide data both as a dataframe and as a csv, if you have really custom requirements you can just load the data yourself. For the cli it will add an additional input parameter that would have to parse something like a json string, and it will have to be escaped so it would look like `--pandas_params \"{\\\"something\\\": some_numerical_value, \\\"something_else\\\": \"some_string_value\", ...}\"` which I don't really like much. An alternative would be to request a yaml string, that would be cleaner, but still pretty clunky. users can also always load the dataframe and then save it in a utf-8 comma separated way, that takes 2
