The reason is that you report\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> 27\r\n> ---> 28 mpl.use('TkAgg') # make matplotlib run on mac os\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> But if you look at line 27 and 28 in master they look like this: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/utils/visualization_utils.py#L27\r\n> \r\n> The missing if makes me thing that you are not actually using the code on master. Not sure why, maybe the zip is cached?\r\n> \r\n> Plus, could you please run `from sys import platform; print(platform)` inside colab and thell me what do you get?\r\n\r\nI have the same error in colab\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/647986276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nosa999","id":40929193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTI5MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40929193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999","html_url":"https://github.com/nosa999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nosa999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/648048972","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/137#issuecomment-648048972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/137","id":648048972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODA0ODk3Mg==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T10:17:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T10:17:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">
