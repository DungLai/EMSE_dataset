generate_kfold_splits() function to utils/data_utils.py\r\n\r\nCreate `kfold_training_statistics.json` statistics file to hold results from the k-fold cv run\r\n\r\n```\r\nA new parameter `--k_fold` is now available for the `ludwig train` command.  This is the help output for the new parameter:\r\n```\r\n -kf K_FOLD, --k_fold K_FOLD\r\n                        number of folds for a k-fold cross validation run\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Work to be completed:\r\n* Add `'aggregate': {...}` node to the `fold_training_statistics.json` file\r\n* Parallel processing for k-fold cv.  Note: I have a working version of parallel processing in a separate branch.  I figure it is easier to debug issues with the serial version.  Once we are comfortable with how k-fold cv processing occurs, I'll add the parallel processing functionality.  Parallel processing is implemented using the `joblib` package.\r\n* add unit test for k-fold cv function\r\n* update documentation\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/579560284","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/620#issuecomment-579560284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/620","id":579560284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTU2MDI4NA==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T02:10:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T02:10:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I've been working on this a bit, made some discoveries and pushed some code: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/commit/997c6bc02dffcc726efda7ddbb5978e425ffab96\r\nThe first discovery is that the number of classes was wrong, so I fixed it.\r\nThe second discovery is that there was no way to tell the plot function to draw a line, so now I set it to check how many points are actually there and and set the order ccordingly.\r\nThird discovery: `calibration_curve` return lists of the length it wants even if you specify a specific number of bins, so now i add a 0,0 point at the beginning so that there's at least one point.\r\nFourth discovery: the API version of the test passes, but the CLI version does not, so there's something fishy there.\r\nI wasn't able to fix the problem anyway, it goes deep in seaborn's linear algebra functions and it's pretty hard to figure out to be hones because of pretty arcane error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: On entry to DLASCL parameter number 4 had an illegal value\r\n```\r\nIt is probably related to the fact that there are nans in the matrix to invert, but I'm not 100 sure how nans end up there in the CLI case and not in the API case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/579560284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/579717297","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/620#issuecomment-579717297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/620","id":579717297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTcxNzI5Nw==","user":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T11:40:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T11:40:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I

What should the structure of the probabilities matrix?  Since the api version works, I'm thinking the first two columns contain the predicted probability for that particular class.  The 3rd column could be the probability for the predicted class.\r\n\r\nDoes this observation point to a direction to resolve this

  I may have found root cause for this issue.  In a nutshell the issue occurs when generating calibration plots for the `<UNK>` class.  If this class is bypassed, then both the **api** and **cli** 1_vs_all calibration test plots complete successfully.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, the plot points for the `<UNK>` class are only (0,0).
