not exceeding 224x224 as a image size, as othersize model training would require a lot of memory and it will be really slow. @ydudin3 maybe we can add something about it in the documentation, plus moving all parameters from the feature itself to preprocessing as it happens for other features and impose a defaul maximum size, so that if the dimension of images is above that size images are resized users get a warning printed on the
