I haven't tried using 1.16.1 and 1.16.2 to check if they solved the bugs. You could install 1.16.2 and run the test suite (how to do it is explained in the developers guide). If tests pass, I could update to 1.16.2 in the next release.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2:\r\nAt the moment you can't. I was thinking about adding an additional `clip` parameter to numerical output features that would clip the values to a specific range before outputtting them. That would solve your problem. But in general, it really depends on the loss and the interpretation of the values, if you two values are probabilities, then you want to use `binary` as data type, if they actually are numerical values, using sigmoid is not a good idea because of saturation (the model will learn easily to predict a specific value, like 0.75, but will have a really hard time predicting 0.99 and it is impossible for the model to predict exactly 0 or 1).\r\nIf clipping works for you i would mark it as a feature request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/475387063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2220932352,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMjA5MzIzNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2220932352","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-21T20:20:19Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2220932355,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMjA5MzIzNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2220932355","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-21T20:20:19Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/475453406","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/238#issuecomment-475453406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/238","id":475453406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTQ1MzQwNg==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T00:36:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T00:38:53Z

@w4nderlust! \r\nI have some problems in integrating a Ludwig model inside our platform. I try to explain briefly my problem:\r\n\r\nFirst of all I build a Docker container where I create a training script using LudwigModel and installing all packages in this way: \r\n\r\n```\r\npip3.6 install ludwig\r\npython3.6 -m spacy download en\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created a model that satisfies me, so I would like to export this model in our platform. \r\nHere comes the strange thing:\r\nfor our platform we have our installation pip package pipeline (different from Ludwig) and after doing this, I install ludwig as I described above. \r\nWhen I take the pre-trained model and I load it in our platform, there are no errors but the results of prediction on our platform are completely different from Ludwig standalone environment, on the same input data!! \r\nThat's quite strange because all requirements.txt are satisfied and no errors appear. \r\n\r\nIf you have some advice or any idea, it would save
