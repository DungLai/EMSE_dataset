I start the Ludwig AutoML job(s) from the Ray head\r\n(sometimes with the Ray autoscaler enabled, sometimes not).  I typically then spin down the Ray cluster\r\nafter I've finished all my AutoML jobs & retrieved artifacts of interest from the head after the run

@Jeffwan, I think the approach of using a Job should work well, particularly to support retires in the event of node failure. The [docs](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/tree/master/examples/ray/kubernetes) we have for running with Kuberay only give an example of running directly on the head node, so we can definitely add detail for running production jobs.\r\n\r\nWe actually use something a bit more involved internally at Predibase, where we run a [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) worker inside the Ray head node that pulls training requests from a job queue. But this would be a lot of infra setup if you're not already using Temporal (that said, it has been working quite well for us).\r\n\r\nProbably the biggest gotcha when using Kubernetes it to ensure syncing is setup properly. If you have checkpoints being written to object storage, it should be fine, but if you want to copy checkpoints between nodes in the k8s cluster, we have a PR in review (https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/2115) that should address some issues we were seeing with using the Kubernetes namespace syncer in Ray.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1158921658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6829319684,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5L3oOzzwAAAAGXDyYE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829319684","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-17T14:21:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6829319692,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5L3oOzzwAAAAGXDyYM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829319692","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-17T14:21:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1164111176","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2153#issuecomment-1164111176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2153","id":1164111176,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5FYu1I","user":{"login":"ShreyaR","id":5787923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODc5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5787923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyaR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-23T08:27:53Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T08:27:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi
