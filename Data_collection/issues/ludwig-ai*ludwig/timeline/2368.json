retain that validation and test sets are optional in Ludwig. Only the training dataset is required.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a couple of exceptions that arise when a user's configuration results in an empty validation or an empty test set when relying on Ludwig's random splitting during data preprocessing when `0` is used as one of the split probabilities, i.e.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npreprocessing:\r\n    split:\r\n        probabilities: [0.7, 0, 0.3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1: `ValueError: need at least one array to stack`\r\n\r\nThis comes from `to_numpy_dataset()` when it gets an empty data frame. The fix is to call `to_list()` instead of `np.stack()` if the dataframe is empty.\r\n\r\n### 2: `ValueError: Dataset is empty following preprocessing`\r\n\r\nThis comes from `backend.dataset_manager.create()`. The fix is to move checking for empty datasets after creating the validation and test datasets, pass if the validation or test datasets are empty, and raise a `ValueError` specifically if the training set is empty.\r\n\r\n### Fix: Zombie test datasets.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a fix to `RandomSplitter` to ensure that the test set is certainly empty if the split probability for it is `0`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2368, Co-authored-by @arnavgarg1 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2382/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7201111024,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5Pfg0LzwAAAAGtODvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7201111024","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T23:12:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
