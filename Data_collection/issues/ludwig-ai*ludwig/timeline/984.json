Documentation Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis PR refers to issue #984.\r\nCreated README_KR.md, a Korean translation file for the main README.md file.\r\nThe part remaining in English in the translation is awkward when translated into Korean or easier to understand in English.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Ludwig for the first time, i was surprised by its convenience and easiness. \r\nThose factors triggered me to translation work. \r\nAlthough some deep learning terms were not easy to translate into Korean, I truely think that it will give an opportunity for more Koreans to access Ludwig by with the translated files. \r\n\r\nContact me if there's something wrong. \r\nThank
