be honest the default behavior for `ludwigModel.predict()` is to not do performance evaluation.

What do you think?\r\n\r\nIf you changed the type of the output feature, you should also delete the hdf5 and json files that are created with the same name of your dataset file, because they will contain the tensors and mappings for the numerical type you were using before, and they are different from the ones that are needed for category features. Just deleting them and running train or experiment again should work. I'm closing the issue for now, if deleting the file does not work, please reopen it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463957356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2141866462,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE0MTg2NjQ2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2141866462","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T08:51:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463959608","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/84#issuecomment-463959608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/84","id":463959608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzk1OTYwOA==","user":{"login":"Designer023","id":1415767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1415767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023","html_url":"https://github.com/Designer023","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Designer023/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T08:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T08:59:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust Thank you again 👍 \r\n\r\nPersonally I would think that switching it around so ```--evaluate_performance``` was the extra flag would make more sense.
