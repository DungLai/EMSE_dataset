Decreasing the learning rate is usually a good starting point, glad it worked for you, but I'm curious if there was something specific in your data that led to this weird behavior. Anyway, there are some knobs for unbalanced data, like label smoothing and class weighting that can turn out to be useful for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/568913262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/569479953","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/592#issuecomment-569479953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/592","id":569479953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQ3OTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"mangleddata","id":57873718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODczNzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57873718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata","html_url":"https://github.com/mangleddata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangleddata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T06:48:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T06:48:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There were some bad outliers in my data which I removed (bad as in unrealistic outliers). I don't know if that's what caused this or not - but since then my data has been cleaned. But still hunting on ideas to improve False Discovery Rate. What I need is to reduce the false discovery rate of one of the class  (but could compromise on other metrics for example). I also oversampled the training data (for example 4x times so the # of datapoints in both the classes are same in train set - but valid/test is kept same). This helped a bit. \r\n\r\nThanks for the tip on label smoothing.
