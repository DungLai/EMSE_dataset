deviation)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/520634812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2551801037,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU1MTgwMTAzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2551801037","actor":{"login":"the-learner","id":12686180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg2MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12686180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner","html_url":"https://github.com/the-learner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T23:45:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2551801039,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NTE4MDEwMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2551801039","actor":{"login":"the-learner","id":12686180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg2MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12686180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner","html_url":"https://github.com/the-learner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T23:45:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2551801414,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NTE4MDE0MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2551801414","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T23:45:35Z","label":{"name":"waiting

That was indeed a question on my mind for some time. I think the function of k-fold splits should be to let the user know that the data size needs to be increased if the accuracy values difference will be considerably large. Because saving aggregate results, or most accurate results will just be an accuracy hack. I think it will just store models and final results for one of the splits. Functionality of k-fold can be to inform user about the nature of data. So the results on the test data will be displayed for the k-splits but final model should just be one as it is now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/520712757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"the-learner","id":12686180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg2MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12686180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner","html_url":"https://github.com/the-learner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-learner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2552347094,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU1MjM0NzA5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2552347094","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T06:53:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2552347097,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NTIzNDcwOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2552347097","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T06:53:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
