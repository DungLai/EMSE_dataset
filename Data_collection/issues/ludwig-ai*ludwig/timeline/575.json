The issue was the file generated seemed corrupted or incomplete when I tried to load it.\r\n\r\nGot it, but you can understand that I need to se the error you were getting about corrupted file, otherwise it's difficult to figure out what the problem is.\r\nIdeally you could provide a minimal self contained reproducible zip containing either data and a python script (data can be generated with the `data/dataset_sythesizer.py` script if you can't share it) or data + yaml file + command to run it.\r\n\r\n> Yes. I have that problem and this is mostly a learning exercise to teach marketers, not for production use. I have in my queue to investigate this research next https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/01/21/microsoft-onnx-open-source-optimizations-transformer-inference-gpu-cpu/\r\n> \r\n> It seems to solve that issue.\r\n\r\nIt was tested on 3 layers bert, the latency is much higher on the full model. Still, it's a step forward ;) \r\n\r\nAnyway, I thought you usecase was fast inference at deployment time, but if your goal is just demoing, and you don't care about a super scalable inference pipeline, then you can train a model with Ludwig and then serve it with\r\n```\r\nludwig serve --model_path path/to/trained/model\r\n```\r\nand it will launch a REST API server you can query easily.
