change enables using the `defaults` keyword within hyperopt to set default parameters for feature groups. This will help add search spaces more concisely for datasets with a large number of features while also reducing the search space to allow for a deeper search during hyperopt. \r\n\r\nFor e.g., a user can now add \r\n\r\n``` \r\n\"defaults.text.num_filters\": {\"space\": \"choice\", \"categories\": [64, 128, 256, 512]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin their hyperopt search space so that all text features (inputs and outputs) use the sampled `cell_type` for that particular trial. \r\n\r\nThe API for this change is as follows: `defaults.<feature_type>.<parameter>`, where:\r\n\r\n- `feature_type`: a valid input or output feature type, for e.g., text/category/sequence etc.\r\n- `parameter`: the parameter to search over for that particular feature type, for e.g., `embedding_size` for category features\r\n\r\nExample Configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhyperopt:\r\n    goal: minimize\r\n    parameters:\r\n        trainer.learning_rate:\r\n            lower: 0.0001\r\n            upper: 0.01\r\n            space: loguniform\r\n        defaults.text.num_filters:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        defaults.category.embedding_size:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        ....\r\n    ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: The output `status` that gets logged every few seconds will show the parameter as `defaults.text.cell_type` in the printed table with each trial status, but underneath the surface, this is getting updated correctly. This is unfortunately not something we can control, but I think it is okay to leave it this way anyway because the table width would become too large if we were to add a column for each feature whose default parameter was updated in the trial status table that gets printed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1563\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 1 12 33 PM\"

Build a new container image based on `ludwigai/ludwig:0.5.2` and override the entrypoint (I tried to install ludwig python package on top of ray image but encounter issues when building horovod)\r\n2. Use the image to create a Ray cluster through KubeRay and get connection string `10.227.151.166:32471`\r\n3. Start a new ludwig container (can access above address) and run the program.\r\n```\r\nexport RAY_ADDRESS=ray://10.227.151.166:32471\r\npython3 script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe should not see the type error. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n-
