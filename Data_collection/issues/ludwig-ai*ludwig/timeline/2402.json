Here's my output from your repro commands:\r\n[rotten_tomatoes_output.txt](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/files/9420171/rotten_tomatoes_output.txt)\r\n\r\nOne hypothesis is that the config that gets generated from `init_config` sets `trainer.batch_size` to `auto`, which chooses the largest batch size that can fit in memory. \r\n\r\nPerhaps there's something weird that happens when this is too large or too small, and the subsequent # training steps calculation becomes a ridiculously high number, i.e. `18446744073709551614`.\r\n\r\nIn my run, `batch_size=auto` selects `batch_size=32768`, which is 200 training steps (2 steps per epoch, for 100 epochs).\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n\r\n1. What batch size is `auto` selecting for you? This should be available in the stdout under the `MODEL` box.\r\n\r\n```\r\n╒═══════╕\r\n│ MODEL │\r\n╘═══════╛\r\nTuning batch size...\r\nExploring batch_size=2\r\nExploring batch_size=4\r\nExploring batch_size=8\r\nExploring batch_size=16\r\nExploring batch_size=32\r\nExploring batch_size=64\r\nExploring batch_size=128\r\nExploring batch_size=256\r\nExploring batch_size=512\r\nExploring batch_size=1024\r\nExploring batch_size=2048\r\nExploring batch_size=4096\r\nExploring batch_size=8192\r\nExploring batch_size=16384\r\nExploring batch_size=32768\r\nSelected batch_size=32768\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Can you try setting batch size in the config manually to a fixed number, i.e. `128`? That should make the error go away.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1226626220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7255108726,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5QKkp0zwAAAAGwcCx2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7255108726","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-25T00:21:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7255108731,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5QKkp0zwAAAAGwcCx7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7255108731","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-25T00:21:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1230956910","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2402#issuecomment-1230956910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2402","id":1230956910,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5JXulu","user":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T23:04:09Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T23:04:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Let me follow your steps and see how it goes.
