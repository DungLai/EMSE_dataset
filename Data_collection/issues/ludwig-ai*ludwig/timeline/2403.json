for posting this question @Jeffwan!\r\n\r\nI had a couple of questions to better understand when you're seeing this behavior so we can reproduce it correctly:\r\n\r\n1. What version of Python are you using?\r\n2. What version of Ludwig are you on? \r\n3. What scheduler are you using in the config?\r\n4. Are you able to confirm that you're trying this on Ray 1.13 as specified in your cluster configuration? Did you try downgrading to maybe 1.12.1 and see if that makes a difference? The latter is currently what the master branch is using so just wanted to double-check.\r\n5. After `time_budget_s` is exceeded, does it ever return / stop, or does it permanently stay in a state of being \"hung\" even after a few minutes? I have some open issues I've filed on Ludwig around seeing it not stopping exactly at `time_budget_s` but actually taking around 1 more minute before stopping so just wanted to check.

after looking into this more, I can confirm that this issue is caused by lack of enough CPU resources.\r\n\r\nIn your current setup, all CPU cores are reserved by the trials, and so there are no cores available for RayDataset tasks like data loading and map batches calls.\r\n\r\nI've filed an issue #2465 that will allow Ludwig to manually throttle the number of concurrent trials you can train when there are limited CPU resources.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there are 2 options for getting unblocked:\r\n- Setting `max_concurrent_trials` in the hyperopt config to <= 2 if training on your current cluster. This should look like:\r\n   ```\r\n     hyperopt:\r\n        executor:\r\n            max_concurrent_trials: 2\r\n    ```\r\n- Training on a larger cluster.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any follow

No. I didn't downgrade to 1.12. I use images built by ludwig.
