Please refrain to use this tone again.\r\n\r\nWe have been working on porting Ludwig to TF2 for months, it's not an easy task as TF2 changes entirely the paradigm of its APIs and many choices in Ludwig that were based on the previous paradigm need to be revised and modified.\r\nMoreover, TF2 is still very young and full of problems and missing features, for that reason we waited to actually port until the features we needed from TF1 were ported, as otherwise we would have had to cut features in the new version of Ludwig, and we did not want to do it.\r\nThe version Ludwig is currently using, 1.15.3 was release the 18th of May 2020, less than 2 months ago, so the use of words like \"obsolete\", \"obsolescence\" and even \"abandonware\" is entirely out of place.\r\n\r\nSo you have a few options:\r\n\r\n- install Python 3.7 and use the current version of Ludwig\r\n- install from the `tf2_porting` branch, knowing it's still a work in progress\r\n- help in the porting process so that you will be able to use Ludwig with TF2 sooner\r\n- wait without being insulting to developers that put their time into this open source project\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/662666021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3577344445,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU3NzM0NDQ0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3577344445","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-22T20:00:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
