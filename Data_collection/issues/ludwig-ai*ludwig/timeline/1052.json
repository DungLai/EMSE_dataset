If i understand correctly the input is one long time series, with each row being a sample in a specific timestamp with a binary label (beat, non beat) associated with it. If this is correct, there are several ways to approach the problem with Ludwig. The way you did it looks as each value of each row to determine if is a beat, even if you are calling those columns timeseries, they are actually just one single number, they may as well be numerical features. But what i believe you may want to do is preprocess the data so that each cell is a list of numerical values (for instance the last 10 values before the present time) then the model will look also at the previous values to figure out is the current timestamp is a beat or not.\r\nHopefully this makes sense to you, I suggest you check out the timeseries example which does a similar preprocessing:
