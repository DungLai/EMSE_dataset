fire,\r\n\r\nGood question! For this particular use case, if you inspect the outputs of `to_inference_module_input_from_dataframe`, the only step taken by the function is creating a List[str] object of length `batch_size` for each feature. Because of this, you should be able implement a similar function in C++ in a relatively straightforward manner. Let me know how that goes, happy to answer any more questions you may have 🙂
