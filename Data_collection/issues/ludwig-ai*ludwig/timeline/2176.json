change enables using the `defaults` keyword within hyperopt to set default parameters for feature groups. This will help add search spaces more concisely for datasets with a large number of features while also reducing the search space to allow for a deeper search during hyperopt. \r\n\r\nFor e.g., a user can now add \r\n\r\n``` \r\n\"defaults.text.num_filters\": {\"space\": \"choice\", \"categories\": [64, 128, 256, 512]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin their hyperopt search space so that all text features (inputs and outputs) use the sampled `cell_type` for that particular trial. \r\n\r\nThe API for this change is as follows: `defaults.<feature_type>.<parameter>`, where:\r\n\r\n- `feature_type`: a valid input or output feature type, for e.g., text/category/sequence etc.\r\n- `parameter`: the parameter to search over for that particular feature type, for e.g., `embedding_size` for category features\r\n\r\nExample Configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhyperopt:\r\n    goal: minimize\r\n    parameters:\r\n        trainer.learning_rate:\r\n            lower: 0.0001\r\n            upper: 0.01\r\n            space: loguniform\r\n        defaults.text.num_filters:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        defaults.category.embedding_size:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        ....\r\n    ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: The output `status` that gets logged every few seconds will show the parameter as `defaults.text.cell_type` in the printed table with each trial status, but underneath the surface, this is getting updated correctly. This is unfortunately not something we can control, but I think it is okay to leave it this way anyway because the table width would become too large if we were to add a column for each feature whose default parameter was updated in the trial status table that gets printed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1563\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 1 12 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106701836/173437112-f8f423e7-735c-48f0-b90f-4d983cb7b1fe.png\">_ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6851773168,"node_id":"LE_lADOCbx2hs5MPIyozwAAAAGYZcLw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6851773168","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-21T23:35:46Z","label":{"name":"productivity and code quality","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
