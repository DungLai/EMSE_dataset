Column 1, 2 and 5 work, while 3 and 4 are mapped to all `True`. To be honest, I believe that this is pretty ok, if you have arbitrary strings like big and small you can always use a categorical feature instead and specify the representation to be sparse (meaning 1 hot encoding) and btain the same thing. Also if you really really want to use a binary feature, then you can manipulate your data to be either 0 and 1 or true and false.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/489365220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2319246894,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMxOTI0Njg5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2319246894","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:00:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/489556068","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/323#issuecomment-489556068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/323","id":489556068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTU1NjA2OA==","user":{"login":"Guufii","id":49252109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUyMTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49252109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii","html_url":"https://github.com/Guufii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T09:10:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T09:10:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @w4nderlust ,\r\nthank you for the hint with the categorical variable I will try that as an alternative.
