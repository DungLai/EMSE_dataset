I work in healthcare, so an example would be having both heart rate and blood pressure for a 24 hour period, split into one hour chunks, and were trying to predict whether or not an event happens following that 24 hour period (many to one) .That is different, unless you tell me otherwise, from creating many univariate rnn encoders. \r\n\r\nBeing able to pass a cell like the following to a rnn

thanks for the detailed explanation. We are working on a multivariate timeseries input type that will do exactly for your cae (although the order of simensions will be batch_size x length of the sequence x features). It is pretty easy to implement, if someone wants to help out on this it would be great, I can give precise and easy instructions on how to go and do it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, you can already do multivariate regression in a slightly different way. You assuming your multivariate time series has 3 dimensions, you would need to have 3 input features in your Ludwig configuration file (make sure all rows have the same length!). Each of them can be encoded separately, but if you don't want it, you can use the `PassthroughEncoder` by specifying `encoder: passthrough` or `encoder: null` in your YAML file, and also specify `reduce: null`. Then add in the `combiner` section of your model definition a sequence combiner (see details in the [User Guide](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#sequence-combiner)). What it does is concatenating the features among the second dimension (length of the sequence) and then providing them to a sequence encoder (all of the usual ones are available: rnn, parallel_cnn, stacked_cnn, etc.). You have to specify:\r\n```\r\ncombiner:\r\n    type: sequence\r\n    encoder: you_choice\r\n    ... encoder parameters ...\r\n```\r\nThis works also for other types of sequential input features, if for instance you have a class assigned to each step of you time series, this approach will allow to use both.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/583108486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3015466198,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAxNTQ2NjE5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3015466198","actor":{"login":"baasman","id":9142120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9142120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman","html_url":"https://github.com/baasman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-06T21:01:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3015466199,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMTU0NjYxOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3015466199","actor":{"login":"baasman","id":9142120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9142120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman","html_url":"https://github.com/baasman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baasman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-06T21:01:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3015466816,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMTU0NjY4MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3015466816","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-06T21:01:20Z","label":{"name":"waiting
