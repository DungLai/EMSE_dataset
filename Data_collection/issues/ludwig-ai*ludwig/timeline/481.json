A few other people also had issues around this recently. \r\n\r\nThere a couple of things that can be done here:\r\n1. Improve error messaging by doing sanity checks on the user inputs - ensure all the required arguments are provided\r\n2. More detailed and complete examples for visualization.\r\n\r\nWe'll prioritize this with other pending tasks but feel free to create a pr for either one if you can.
