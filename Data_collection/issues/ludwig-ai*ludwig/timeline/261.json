@w4nderlust I got this issue both in macos and linux, simply by doing a `pip install ludwig` and executing `simple_model_training.py` in the `examples/titanic` folder. Actually I think it is because [here](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/master/examples/titanic/simple_model_training.py#L24) we call the api with config as str (i.e. file path), and [in the api](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/api.py#L193) we try to get the `backend` from the string, which results in an error. I opened the PR #1213  to resolve the issue. Using the previously validated `self.config` works for me perfectly, and should work as well in all setups. Many thanks and best regards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/866798198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vreyespue","id":42059733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU5NzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42059733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue","html_url":"https://github.com/vreyespue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vreyespue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4928546095,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDkyODU0NjA5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4928546095","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-23T12:37:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4928546098,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5Mjg1NDYwOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4928546098","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-23T12:37:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/871781100","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/261#issuecomment-871781100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/261","id":871781100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTc4MTEwMA==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-30T23:03:07Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T23:03:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The
