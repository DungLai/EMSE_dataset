Every initial release of any large enough software contains bug, no matter how thoroughly you tested it, and we are here trying to solve all the bugs that show up as quickly as possible, a little bit of understanding (and maybe help) would be much more appreciated.\r\nAnyway, we tested on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 and with a small amount of hyperparameter tuning we were able to get results really close to state of the art on those datasets.\r\n\r\nWe will have a look into the issue with the `interpolate` option. I suspect it's a datatype issue, as there's an implicit assumption of the type to be int8, and that may be the issue here, the output of the interpolation may actually be a normalized float and that makes for a 0 value ending up in the hdf5.\r\n\r\nRegarding the normalization, we can add an optional \"normalize\" parameter to the image encoder that will perform that.\r\n\r\n@ydudin3 can you look into this please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/464415434/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2144505465,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE0NDUwNTQ2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2144505465","actor":{"login":"allenkao","id":9897893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTc4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9897893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao","html_url":"https://github.com/allenkao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-17T04:20:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2144505466,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNDQ1MDU0NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2144505466","actor":{"login":"allenkao","id":9897893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTc4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9897893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao","html_url":"https://github.com/allenkao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allenkao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-17T04:20:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2144505467,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE0NDUwNTQ2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2144505467","actor":{"login":"ydudin3-zz","id":33033675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDMzNjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33033675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/ydudin3-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-17T04:20:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2144505468,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNDQ1MDU0Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2144505468","actor":{"login":"ydudin3-zz","id":33033675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMz
