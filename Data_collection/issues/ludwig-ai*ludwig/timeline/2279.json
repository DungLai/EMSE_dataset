@noahlh!\r\n\r\nWhat you've proposed is actually quite reasonable -- could you create a PR with this change, with an additional test case in `test_date_to_list` in `test_date_feature.py`?\r\n\r\nLooking into this a bit, it looks like there's a discrepancy between `pandas.read_csv` and `pandas.read_json`. The former parses date-like strings as an object while the latter parses date-like strings as `datetime64[ns]` type. This confirms your hypothesis that the data is being parsed as a datetime string \"too early\".\r\n\r\nThere's a more principled solution to cast all datetime features to `datetime64[ns]` always in preprocessing, and handle pure datetime objects during feature data building. However, this would require some additional refactoring since the way missing value handling is currently implemented for date features happens within the feature data building stage.\r\n\r\nI think your patch is a reasonable stopgap -- happy to help you land that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1184946297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6997714866,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5Ny3hvzwAAAAGhGKey","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6997714866","actor":{"login":"noahlh","id":113276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh","html_url":"https://github.com/noahlh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-14T22:12:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6997714874,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5Ny3hvzwAAAAGhGKe6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6997714874","actor":{"login":"noahlh","id":113276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh","html_url":"https://github.com/noahlh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-14T22:12:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1184975683","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2279#issuecomment-1184975683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2279","id":1184975683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5GoUtD","user":{"login":"noahlh","id":113276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh","html_url":"https://github.com/noahlh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahlh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T23:08:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T23:08:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@justinxzhao
