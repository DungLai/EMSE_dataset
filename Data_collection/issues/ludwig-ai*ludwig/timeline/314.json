Do we have an update on this enhancement? It is vital for comparing Ludwig with other AutoML systems and as @manugarri mentioned, the common ground is `max_runtime`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/585220514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iXanthos","id":22717082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzE3MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22717082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos","html_url":"https://github.com/iXanthos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iXanthos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3030933202,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAzMDkzMzIwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3030933202","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-12T14:05:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3030933206,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMzA5MzMyMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3030933206","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-12T14:05:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3030933217,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAzMDkzMzIxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3030933217","actor":{"login":"manugarri","id":3670355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzAzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3670355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri","html_url":"https://github.com/manugarri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manugarri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-12T14:05:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3030933220,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMzA5MzMyMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3030933220","actor":{"login":"manugarri","id":3670355,"node_id

it's not really about the ML/DL part, it's about the Auto part :) At the moment Ludwig has no way to specify directly an hyperparameter search, the only thing it does is providing you with reasonable default for your model configuration, there is nothing automatic other than the model composition, so I definitely wouldn't call it AutoML or AutoDL. At least not yet, as hyperopt is coming.\r\n\r\nRegarding how to implement the timeout, it's pretty simple: you start a timer around line 427 of `models/model.py` at the beginning of the training, and then after each batch of training (line 580) you check if the timer is above the maximum time (you have to add an additional parameter for that in the train function signature), if that's true then you break, and you also want to add this check in the evaluation calls (608, 614, 623) and at the end of the epoch (741). Alternatively, you can create a scheduled timer that fires when passes the maximum time and calls a function that halts the training, similar to `set_epochs_to_1_or_quit`. Let me know if this is clear and if you need more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/586490181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
