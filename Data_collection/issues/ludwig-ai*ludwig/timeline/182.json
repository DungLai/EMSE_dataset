will not become a machine learning 101 book, that would be nice but would require too much time unfortunately and i prefer to spend it on features and bugs as there are already thousands of other resources that teach machine learning and deep learning concepts, including what parameters to change and what is their effect.\r\nWhat I could actually do is coming up with a curated list of
