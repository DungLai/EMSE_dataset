for the suggestion.\r\nI read it carefully and I decided I'm not going to implement it.\r\nThere is no use case I can think of for obtaining all the categories, as if they were not sorted it would be useless, and if they were sorted, the same sorting can be obtained from `<field_name>_probabilities.csv` because the probabilities in that file are sorted according to the ordering in the mapping of category to integer available in `train_set_metadata.json` under the name of the field with the key `idx2str`.\r\nThank you anyway for the
