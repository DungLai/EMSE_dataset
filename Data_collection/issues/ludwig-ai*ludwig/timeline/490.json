thanks for the advice, I agree that this feature should be generally available for different inputs/outputs. However, considering how most data augmentation techniques are highly domain-specific (image, text, timeseries, etc), I was wondering if we should initially approach this feature as being configurable depending on the input data type (text, image, numerical, timeseries, etc)?   \r\n\r\nSome brief [literature review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05538.pdf) indicates that some domain-agnostic techniques exist, but I am not sure of their accuracy/performance/general acceptance within the ML community. \r\n\r\nAny advice would be much appreciated, thanks!
