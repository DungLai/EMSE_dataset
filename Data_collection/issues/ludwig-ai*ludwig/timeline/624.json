For instance I work with python 3.5 usually (for compatibility) and have never seen this specific issue, while in other case I had Ludwig run fine on 3.4 and 3.5. Anyway, if things like this happen consistently maybe I can add rules to the CI tool to deal with them, what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/580046073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/580306855","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/624#issuecomment-580306855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/624","id":580306855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDMwNjg1NQ==","user":{"login":"slederman","id":1242400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman","html_url":"https://github.com/slederman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slederman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T15:28:04Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T15:28:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Coding in rules sounds like a great idea to me.
