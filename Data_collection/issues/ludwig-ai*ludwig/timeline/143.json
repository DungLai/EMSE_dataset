for the quick response. I was just confused because the [documentation](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#train) stated, that the GPU list are the IDs separated by comma. This now works but I found that at least in our environment `mpirun` (v 3.0.0) just overwrites the `-g` arguments and as stated correctly running ludwig w/o `mpirun` fails for distributed training making `-g` somewhat obsolete.\r\n\r\nOther than that thanks for the package. It was very smooth sailing to set up distributed training on a GPU cluster. Thanks a lot for that. Great work.

am trying to run an experiment via the CLI on a single node of a remote HPC cluster with 4 Tesla K80 GPUs, but running nvidia-smi shows that only of the GPUs is actually being utilized, even though I

I am aware of previous issues with Horovod -- namely [https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/143](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/143) -- but I really thought the command below would check all the boxes, including the instructions to also run mpirun:\r\n\r\n`mpirun -np 4 --oversubscribe -bind-to none -map-by slot -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH ludwig experiment --dataset /home/lfp/Master_Data.csv --data_format csv --experiment_name XP1 --eval_split test --model_name LTT_6 --config_file /home/lfp/LTT_6_config.yaml --output_directory /home/lfp/Out3/ -uh -g 0 1 2 3`\r\n\r\nI have also included backend: type: horovod in my config file. \r\n\r\nIn short, the experiment will run, albeit on only one GPU even though Tensorflow does recognize all 4 CUDA-enabled devices.
