Now there's a slight weirdness with using `text` the rather than `sequence` in that bert doesn't properly use words, this will be solved in future versions where words, chars and bpes will be treated the same way.\r\nBut for now `word_sequence_length_limit` if `text` and `sequence_length_limit`if `sequence` should do the job.\r\n\r\nYou can define it both at the input feature level or at the global preprocessing level. The difference is that in the global preprocessing it applies to all features of a specific type, while at input feature level it applies only to that specific feature. If you define both, the input feature one overrides the global one.\r\n\r\nConsider that 1200 words is very very long for bert, you are likely going to run out memory even if you set the batch size to be very small, so you may want to trade it off.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/631152664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3354155267,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM1NDE1NTI2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3354155267","actor":{"login":"danielduckworth","id":18698360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njk4MzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18698360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth","html_url":"https://github.com/danielduckworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-20T00:01:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3354155268,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNTQxNTUyNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3354155268","actor":{"login":"danielduckworth","id":18698360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njk4MzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18698360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth","html_url":"https://github.com/danielduckworth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielduckworth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-20T00:01:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3354155622,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMzNTQxNTU2MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3354155622","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-20T00:01:09Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"008500"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url"
