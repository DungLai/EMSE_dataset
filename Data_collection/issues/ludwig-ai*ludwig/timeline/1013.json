I think Ludwig definitely should support more elaborate training procedures like GANs, it's just a question of what the right user experience is in these situations.\r\n\r\nIf we take the generator and discriminator individually, each of them can be represented as distinct Ludwig model definition.  The complexity then lies in the training procedure itself.  Specifically, we would need support for such things as:\r\n\r\n- Multiple models per config\r\n- Multiple optimizers (e.g., a map of `model_name: optimizer`)\r\n- Policy for switching between training the different models\r\n- Discriminator: augment training dataset with outputs of generator (label=fake)\r\n- Generator: custom loss function that incorporates output of the Discriminator\r\n- Generator: ability to train on synthetic (random noise) data\r\n- Generator: add decoders for image, audio, and other types we wish to generate\r\n\r\nI think these would all be good general improvements to the flexibility of Ludwig.  Let me know if you think I'm missing anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/730482217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4016702365,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAxNjcwMjM2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4016702365","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-19T16:17:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4016702374,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMTY3MDIzNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4016702374","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-19T16:17:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/730486777","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1013#issuecomment-730486777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1013","id":730486777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDQ4Njc3Nw==","user":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T16:25:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T18:03:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"One
