I am trying to train an image classifier, eventually on multiple GPUs on one machine. My hdf5 file is rather large (>60GB, ~100k images). From what I understand, for each GPU used, a copy of the HDF5 file gets loaded into the system RAM. In my case, 4 GPUs would require >240GB RAM (plus some overhead during the initialization process), which I have not available.\r\nI thought the `in_memory: false` option in the .yaml file would solve that problem and load the batches directly from the hard drive instead of loading the entire HDF5 file into RAM.\r\n\r\nWhen I train with the conventional command (using the yaml file from above)\r\n`ludwig train --data_csv annotations.csv --model_definition_file model_def.yaml` I still observe that the the HDF5 file gets loaded into memory. e.g. the `in_memory: false` has no effect.

Will definitely look into it in more detail.\r\nIn the mean time maybe this could help you: at the moment the logic (admittedly not perfectly documented) in features with `in_memory` option (images and audio) is that raw data is preprocessed one image at a time and added to a HDF5 file `features/image_feature.py:L248-L272`, then the data is read, batch by batch from the HDF5 file on disk `data/dataset.py:L49-L60`. If you run this using Horovod, every worker will try to create the HDF5 file, and that's already a problem in itself, but also all of them will consume RAM (even if in theory writing to the HDF5 file should not require much RAM, so this is something we have to investigate).\r\nNow, one way I can see that you can solve the problem is if you run the preprocessing once on a single machine (you can either start the training on one machine and kill it during the first epoch or you can use the command `python -m ludwig.data.preprocessing`, it has the sme parameters of train and experiment, yo ucan see them with the `-h` argument), obtain the HDF5 file, and then run the train with horovod: all the workers will now stream from the HDF5 file and things should be good. Admittedly it is something we haven't tested thoroughly, in case also this doesn't work we'll try to help you out as fast as we can.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/528707053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2613149056,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxMzE0OTA1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2613149056","actor":{"login":"tboo","id":19666785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo","html_url":"https://github.com/tboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T04:50:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2613149058,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTMxNDkwNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2613149058","actor":{"login":"tboo","id":19666785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo","html_url":"https://github.com/tboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T04:50:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2613149437,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjYxMzE0OTQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2613149437","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T04:50:22Z","label":{"name":"waiting

with horovod: all the workers will now stream from the HDF5 file and things should be good. \r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I have been doing. To me it looks like that not all workers stream from a single HDF5 but instead each loads their 'own' version of the HDF5 into the RAM.\r\nWhat puzzled me is, that in the documentation for audio it says that only `in_memory: true` is supported. No such statement is there for images. Is this on purpose? Just wondering if `in_memory: false` is a feature yet.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/528825037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tboo","id":19666785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo","html_url":"https://github.com/tboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/533216635","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/509#issuecomment-533216635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/509","id":533216635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzIxNjYzNQ==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T16:49:00Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T21:49:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@tboo the `in_memory` feature is there and used to work for image features.
