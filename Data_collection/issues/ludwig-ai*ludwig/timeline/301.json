it, thanks for the details.\r\n\r\nI guess one thing you could try is to install Ludwig by cloning the repo and running setup.py. That allows you to change the requirements before installing it (for instance removing [line 49](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/setup.py#L49) from setup.py), and remove spaCy. At the moment spaCy provides some advances tokenizers for text, so if you don't need / use them this should be fine.\r\nLet me know if this helps.\r\n\r\nRegarding tf-lite, I've never used it, so investigating it would be interesting. Anyway, I believe I may be using some features from tf 1.12 and 1.13, so if the latest tf available to you is 1.10, there may be some issues with different method signatures. In that case, the ideal would be to compile tf 1.13, but as you said, bazel is needed for doing that.
