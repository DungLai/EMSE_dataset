Also, do you already have TensorFlow installed before you attempt to install Ludwig?\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be any incompatibility with Ludwig and this version of TensorFlow. The issues are likely arising due to the way TensorFlow names their pip packages for specific hardware, which often conflict with the standard package names. It's usually something we can workaround by either letting Ludwig install first and installing TensorFlow afterwards, or (in the worse case) by installing Ludwig from source and removing the `tensorflow` dependency from the `requirements.txt`

Ludwig.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/791712885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4415495495,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQxNTQ5NTQ5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4415495495","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-05T21:15:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4415495501,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MTU0OTU1MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4415495501","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-05T21:15:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/846522121","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1101#issuecomment-846522121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1101","id":846522121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjUyMjEyMQ==","user":{"login":"carlogrisetti","id":4464640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQ2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4464640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti","html_url":"https://github.com/carlogrisetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-23T08:04:19Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T08:04:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@camaya7
