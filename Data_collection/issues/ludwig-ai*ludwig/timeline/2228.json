fix https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2228\r\n\r\nI observed two situations where these tests fail:\r\n1.  The original issue, which happens only with `elementwise_mean` reduction and `ignore_index=True`.  With `ignore_index=True` we choose `iix = y[0]`.  Since the batch size is 5, there is a 1/1000 chance that all y[i] == y[0].  This results in a divide by zero in the loss reduction.  Modified loss function to return zero loss if size is 0.\r\n2.  In `test_index_ignored`, it is possible (since this is a sparse loss function) that the ignored index makes exactly 0 contribution to the total loss.  In that case, the strict less-than `assert loss_ignore(x, y) < loss_noignore(x, y)` fails.
