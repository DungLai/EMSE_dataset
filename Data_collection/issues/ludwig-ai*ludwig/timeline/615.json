Thanks a lot for the suggestion. When I added the class_weights for the model, I got the following error: \r\n\r\n`loss_weight = float(self.loss['weight'])\r\nKeyError: 'weight'`\r\n\r\nSince my model is a binary  classification, I think 'class-weight' may not be applicable.\r\n\r\nMy original model definition was:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n  - name: sentence\r\n    type: text\r\n    encoder: parallel_cnn\r\n    level:

'dependencies': [],\r\n                               'loss': {   'confidence_penalty': 0,\r\n                                           'positive_class_weight': 1,\r\n

instruction for specifying 'positive_class_weight'.\r\n\r\nPlease, should I use the following format:\r\n\r\n```\r\npositive_class_weight:5\r\nweight:1\r\n```\r\nThanks once again for taking time out

this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/577410648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olaTechie","id":25159774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTU5Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25159774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie","html_url":"https://github.com/olaTechie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaTechie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2971798572,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk3MTc5ODU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2971798572","actor":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-22T22:12:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2971798574,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NzE3OTg1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2971798574","actor":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-22T22:12:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/577521386","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/615#issuecomment-577521386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/615","id":577521386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzUyMTM4Ng==","user":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T06:12:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T06:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body"

For binary, the current expectation is like below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\noutput_features:\r\n     - \r\n         name: \r\n         type: binary\r\n         loss:\r\n                weight: 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just verified that this works. Maybe we should have the same notation for both binary and category features @w4nderlust

a bit of confusion here. `weight` is not the class weight for binary features. `weight` is a parameter used when a multi-task setting is used, i.e. when there is more than one feature and one wants to give a different weight to the loss of a specific feature. This has nothing to do with the weights of each class. I just realized this is not explained anywhere in the docs so we will have to add it.\r\n\r\n`class_weights` on the other hand does exactly what you are looking for, but it is available currently only for categorical features.
