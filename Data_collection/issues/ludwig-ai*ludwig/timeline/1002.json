One thing that may explain the difference is preprocessing. Do you have a cached hdf5 from previous trainings? In case remove it and make Ludwig perform preprocessing again, because the tokenizers used are different and it can make quite a big difference.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, we are adding a feature that checks if the hdf5 cache files are \"fresh\" to avoid these kind of problems in the future: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/pull/1006","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/727040645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/730359976","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1002#issuecomment-730359976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1002","id":730359976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDM1OTk3Ng==","user":{"login":"donfour10","id":55831555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODMxNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55831555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10","html_url":"https://github.com/donfour10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donfour10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T13:00:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T13:00:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the late answer.\r\n\r\nI'm relatively sure that i don't have a hdf5 cached because it's default on false but I don't know how to check it.
