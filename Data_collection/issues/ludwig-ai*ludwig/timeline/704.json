 Got it, i understand the issue, but there is a bigger one, which is the fact that data is preprocessed by Ludwig in python as well as it is postprocessed, which means that when serving the model with TServing you would have anyway to preprocess the data too, as well as postprocessing the model outputs. That's actually what `ludwig serve` does for you (although the model is not served by TFServing, but just loaded in memory).\r\n\r\nSo adding the alphabetical sorting may solve this specific instance where your labels are numbers, but wouldn't solve the bigger postprocessing issue and not solve the bigger serving issue.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest you to do is to use Ludwig's python preprocessing and postprocessing functions and wrap the tf serving around them. If the serving needs to be done in another language  like Java or Go, you can in most cases easily load `train_set_metadata.json` and perform the pre and psot processing.\r\nI know it's not straightforward and requires some work, but that's the best solution so far. I'm considering adding some preprocessing and psotprocessing to the TF graph, so that the TFServing wouldn't need any wrapper, but the problem is that some the processing that I do is pretty elaborate, doing it in the graph would be complicated and I would be restricted in the type of preprocessing I could do, so I did not follow that route so far.\r\n\r\nBut anyway thank you for the discussion, I'll try to make model serving outside `ludwig serve` more straightforward in the
