see. At the moment and for the forseable future, the preprocessing is performed in python so there is no way to export it as tf code. if you want to modify it, I suggest you to modify the python code directly, check `ludwig/data/preprocessing.py` to see what happens when Ludwig does the preprocessing and play around with it. Consider that each feature has it's own preprocessing that you can find in the BaseFeature object in each `/ludwig/feature*_feature.py` module.\r\nOne thing i would suggest you anyway is to avoid changing the preprocessing after you trained a model, as discrepancies in the pipeline you use for prediction may result in poor results. If you want to change the pipeline do it before training, and then keep the same one when predicting. Also consider that if you call the `LudwigModel.predict()` method from the programmatic API, the pipeline of the trained Ludwig model is applied automatically for you.\r\nMarking this as a feature request, but also as a wontfix, at least for now.

more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/549300871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2767225843,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50Mjc2NzIyNTg0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2767225843","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T10:47:55Z","label":{"name":"waiting
