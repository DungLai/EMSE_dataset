I would like also to assume that the user that created the model (or the team) is able to understand what are the labels that will be predicted (using the same case you mentioned above) as well as how the data will look like when **predict** is called. In other words, the user(s) is responsible for the input and the output of the model. \r\n\r\nGiven that, the cli could expose something like this `ludwig expose --model_path=/path/to/model --mapper=/path/to/JSON_mapper`. Internally, what _ludwig_ can do is to wrap the model into a POST REST endpoint - something like this\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom ludwig import LudwigModel\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\nmodel_path = ... # you get this from the cli\r\nmapper_path = ... # you get this from the cli\r\n\r\n@app.route('/model/predict', ['POST'])\r\ndef predict():\r\n    body = request.get_json(silent=True)\r\n    # map input based on JSON file containing mappings from strings to tensors\r\n    mapper = read_mapper(mapper_path)\r\n    input = mapper.transform_input(body)\r\n   \r\n    # load model\r\n    model = LudwigModel.load(model_path)\r\n\r\n    # obtain predictions\r\n    predictions = model.predict(input)\r\n   \r\n    # map output based on JSON file containing mappings from strings to tensors\r\n    result = mapper.transform_output(predictions)\r\n    return jsonify(result)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    # read cli here\r\n    model_path = ...\r\n    mapper_path = ...\r\n\r\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe body of the POST request needs to respect some rules in order to map with the JSON file. You can argue with the fact that the JSON file may not be available but perhaps for the time being, the JSON file could be carried with the model and passed via the CLI. I am sure that there are smarter ways for doing so but maybe this can work. \r\nIt would be possible to extend the **cli** with other arguments such as: port, debug (true/false), host, etc. I would be happy to contribute on this if you think that could work :) \r\n\r\nThis is the first thing that popped into my mind on how to do it. I didn't test the code nor I don't know if it could work. The whole point is that the user should take care of the data in input and the expected output can be taken care by the webservice (or client in general).\r\n\r\nThe whole point of this **expose** is to help teams in integrating the data scientist work in the engineering development. This can also help to Dockerize the models and using it in a production environment (if suitable). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope all this makes sense :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463123499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"spaghettifunk","id":1409994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1409994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk","html_url":"https://github.com/spaghettifunk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463415378","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55#issuecomment-463415378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55","id":463415378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzQxNTM3OA==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T23:17:06Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T23:17:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I think I get your point, but there's probably something you are missing about the API: Ludwig saves what you call mapper inside the model directory, and calls it `train_set_metadata`. moreover, when you call `model.predict()` Ludwig already performs the mapping of raw data into tensor using the content of that metadata file and already maps the outputs back into the data space again using the contents of that filw.\r\nSo it's already done for you :)\r\nMoreover, `model.predict()` accepts a dictionary as input that looks like `{'feature1_name': [...], 'feature2_name': [...]}` (lists are there because you can provide more than one datapoint at a time) so you can basically directly parse the JSON coming from the request and give it to `model.predict(data_dict=body)`.

Is it similar to some kind of NAS(neural architecture search)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463526316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AllenDun","id":14049868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQ5ODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14049868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun","html_url":"https://github.com/AllenDun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AllenDun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463546544","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55#issuecomment-463546544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55","id":463546544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzU0NjU0NA==","user":{"login":"spaghettifunk","id":1409994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1409994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk","html_url":"https://github.com/spaghettifunk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spaghettifunk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T08:58:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T08:58:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust Thanks for your clarification.

because I can host it on Google cloud ML which supports tensorflow\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/468443172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jadjoubran","id":2265232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjUyMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2265232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran","html_url":"https://github.com/jadjoubran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadjoubran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2172346773,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE3MjM0Njc3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2172346773","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-28T21:21:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2172346775,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNzIzNDY3NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2172346775","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-28T21:21:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/468472577","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55#issuecomment-468472577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/55","id":468472577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODQ3MjU3Nw==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T22:55:59Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T22:56:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@jadjoubran there are other discussions about it. The tensorflow model weights are saved in the model directory, so you can actually just load it with tensorflow and do whatever you want with it. The problem is mostly that you will have to map the inputs yourself into tensors. You can do it using the `train_set_metadata.json` file that is also saved in the model directory. Ludwig preprocessing at prediction time is basically taking that file, taking the raw inputs and mapping them into tensors using those mappings.\r\nThere is a discussion on Gitq of someone trying to serve models trained with Ludwig in Java that has the same questions that you have, try to look
