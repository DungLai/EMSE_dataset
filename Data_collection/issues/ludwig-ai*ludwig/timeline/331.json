 thanks for offering to help!\r\nThe ideal place to put it would be in the `features` package, something like `boundingbox_feature.py`.\r\nIt would have to contain both a class improting from `BaseFeature` and one importing from `OutputFeature` and should implement all the methods that are defined in those objects.\r\nYou can use the `numerical_feature.py` as a blueprint and modify things accordingly, knowing that the outputs are going to be a 4d vector, that the measures are different (intersection-over-union) and the loss will be different.\r\nRefer to the object detection literature (for instance eq. 2 and 3 in [Fast R-CNN](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Girshick_Fast_R-CNN_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) or section 2.1 in [YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf)) for figuring out the measures people usually use and the most adequate losses.\r\nIdeally one may want to support also multiple boxes rather than only one, but this would be a great starting point.\r\nLet me know if you need further

PR details\r\nThis PR refers to issue #331. It adds a `bounding_box` output feature to the library. This way the user can train models with `bounding_box` output like it is encountered in object detection. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only implemented measure is IOU (Intersection-Over-Union). The current default loss is the smoothed L1 loss (also called Huber loss) used by the Fast R-CNN algorithm. I plan to add the YOLO v3 localization loss as well. The following snippet runs flawlessly, but I might have forgotten key additions to make this feature usable so feel free to change it/let me know!\r\n\r\nBasic test that I ran:\r\n```python\r\nfrom ludwig.api import LudwigModel\r\nfrom sklearn import datasets\r\nimport pandas as pd \r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\niris = datasets.load_iris()\r\ntraining_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=['a','b','c','d'])\r\ntraining_dataframe['target'] = list(map(lambda x: np.array([x,x,x,x]), iris['target']))\r\n\r\n# train a model\r\nmodel_definition = {\r\n\t'input_features': [\r\n\t\t{'name': 'a', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'b', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'c', 'type': 'numerical'},\r\n\t\t{'name': 'd', 'type': 'numerical'}\r\n\t], \r\n\t'output_features': [{'name': 'target', 'type': 'bounding_box'}]\r\n}\r\nmodel = LudwigModel(model_definition)\r\ntrain_stats = model.train(training_dataframe)\r\npredictions = model.predict(training_dataframe)\r\nmodel.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation \r\nDoc not updated yet","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/344/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/493083615","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/331#issuecomment-493083615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/331","id":493083615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzA4MzYxNQ==","user":{"login":"jstpierref","id":6504431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDQ0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6504431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref","html_url":"https://github.com/jstpierref","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstpierref/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T14:10:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T14:10:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Submitted a PR.
