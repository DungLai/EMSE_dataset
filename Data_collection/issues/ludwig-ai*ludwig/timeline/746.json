Thank you for being willing to help.\r\nWe are now orking a lot on porting to TF2, so any contribution should start from the `tf2_porting` branch.\r\nLudwig has this concept of encoders for input features that makes it easy to add  new pretrained image encoders.\r\nIf you look at the `features/image_feature.py` you'll find a disctionary of encoder associated with the input feature.\r\nIdeally you may want to add a pretrained model there, giving it a name and implementing the class. Classes for image encoders are in `model/modules/image_encoders.py`.\r\nBasically one need to implement an object with an `__init__` function that contains the parameters (maybe in this case the path to the pretrained model) and a `call` function that takes as inputs tensors of chape `[batch, h, w, c]` and return either `[batch, h', w', c']` or just a `[batch, hidden]` tensor, depending where you cut the original preprocessed model, if before or after flattening.\r\nLet me know if these instructions are clear for you or if you have additional questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/648368347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3474451872,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzQ3NDQ1MTg3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3474451872","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-23T19:22:08Z","rename":{"from":"Is it possible to do transfer learning with images using Ludwig?","to":"Image pre-trained model for transfer learning"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/677437178","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/746#issuecomment-677437178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/746","id":677437178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzQzNzE3OA==","user":{"login":"rajatsahay","id":40163067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTYzMDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40163067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay","html_url":"https://github.com/rajatsahay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajatsahay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T07:53:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T07:53:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey there!\r\nIs anybody still working on this?
