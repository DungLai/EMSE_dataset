We call it `train_online` and you can see it documented here https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/0.5/user_guide/api/LudwigModel/#train_online . The difference with the redular `train` is that it runs on the batch of data provided only once.\r\nThis makes it useful for implementing an active learning loop that may look like:\r\n```\r\nmodel = LudwigModel(...)\r\nmodel.train(my_data)\r\nfor i in active_loop_steps:\r\n  new_data = get_new_data()\r\n  predictions = model.predict(new_data)\r\n  most_valuable_data = active_learning(new_data, predictions)  # need to implement it yourself or use an active learning library for this\r\n  model.train_online(most_valuable_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne may want to also train on old datapoints to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and also maybe manipulate the learning rate and some other hyperparameters for finetuning purposes when using `train_online`, but this is the sketch on how you can use it.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1191904162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7041264844,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5NxnYzzwAAAAGjsSzM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7041264844","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T20:30:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7041264849,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5NxnYzzwAAAAGjsSzR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7041264849","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T20:30:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7041265852,"node_id":"LE_lADOCbx2hs5NxnYzzwAAAAGjsTC8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7041265852","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T20:30:26Z","label":{"name":"waiting
