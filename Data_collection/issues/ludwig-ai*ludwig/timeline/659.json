you provide just the dataset, Ludwig, will split it automatically. If you save the preprocessed data, you can see the split in the hdf5 file that is saved (there's a split column, 0 means training, 1 means validation and 2 means test). This setting is useful if you want to train a model from a dataset and test it on a random split of the data.\r\n\r\nIn the case where you have already a split, you can either provide the already splitted data with the appropriate parameters `--data_train_csv`,  `--data_tvalidation_csv`, `--data_test_csv`. In this case there's no random split, and the data that is predicted is the test set, the rows are aligned as in the first row of Ludwig prediction is the prediction of the first row of your test set and so on.\r\nAlternatively you can also first train your model and then predict on the test set using two separate commands instead of experiment.
