this will improve the performance for small training problems. Also, I've sent you a jupyter notebook and test data set for a regression problem showing the performance issue. What matters more is the regression results are so different between Ludwig and Keras with the same parameter setting, in which Keras results make more sense. If you want me open a new issue to describe it, I can.
