What is the error again?\r\nIf you interrupt it manually, i suspect you did it because it was hanging, but as you are trying to train a BERT model on CPU, it must really well be the case that it is actually trainin,g but it's just really slow (because BERT is huge). So if you stopped it manually, could you please just wait (potentially several minutes) and see if the progress bar starts to report something? Also, please reduce the batch_size to something small, like 8, to see updates on the progress bar more often.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/592791856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3083963784,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwODM5NjM3ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3083963784","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-29T00:33:37Z","label":{"name":"waiting for answer","color":"fff36b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/593080449","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/645#issuecomment-593080449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/645","id":593080449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzA4MDQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"gatemezing","id":922883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMjg4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/922883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing","html_url":"https://github.com/gatemezing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatemezing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-01T10:27:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-01T10:27:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @w4nderlust Thanks for your answer.
