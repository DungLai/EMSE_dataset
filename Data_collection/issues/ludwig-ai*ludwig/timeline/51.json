\r\n@danicattaneob \r\n\r\nI did some research on auto feature generation and for the most part, the generated features were pretty useless. Instead, I came up with ProcFlow to automate the tedious workflow of testing various featureset combinations.  \r\n\r\nNot sure if it is relevant to Ludwig, but certainly for those who do feature engineering before loading datasets into Ludwig or just any other DL framework. \r\n\r\nRepo containing utils & ProcFlow: https://github.com/marvin-hansen/StockUtils\r\n\r\nProcFlow is a mechanism of daisy-chaining data pre-processing workflows (hence ProcFlow) in a way that allows rapid experimentation. Effectively, each ProcFlow describes a \"FeatureSet\" for a given dataset and adds a unique ID to it, so you can load FeatureSet-23 and compare it to FeatureSet-14 on the same data.  \r\n\r\nAnd the procs used in the ProcFlow: \r\nhttps://github.com/marvin-hansen/StockUtils/blob/master/src/procs/Procs.py\r\n\r\nSample ProcFlow:\r\nhttps://github.com/marvin-hansen/StockUtils/blob/master/src/procs/ProcFlow.py\r\n\r\nOn top of ProcFlow, I am building a \"Preperator\" that essentially automates the entire process just before running the experiment. That code is under construction to prepare experimentation automation so be mindful here. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/marvin-hansen/StockUtils/blob/master/src/preps/Preperator.py\r\n\r\nWhile the actual procs I'm using are fairly specialized to the domain I am working on, \r\nthe ProcFlow design is domain agnostic enough for usage in just about any DL project that requires some feature engineering. \r\n\r\nBest\r\nMarvin \r\n\r\n\"The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man 's heart\"\r\n- Generated by artificial intelligence socrates_ml (https://twitter.com/socrates_ml) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/494020811/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marvin-hansen","id":24190940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTkwOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24190940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen","html_url":"https://github.com/marvin-hansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2353385926,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM1MzM4NTkyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2353385926","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-20T14:51:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2353385927,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNTMzODU5Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2353385927","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-20T14:51:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
