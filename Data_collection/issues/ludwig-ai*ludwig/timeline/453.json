it seems that it's not TF breaking retrocompatibility\r\nOn a system that had TF 1.13.1 installed I upgraded ludwig and manually changed the requirements.txt to match 1.13.1 (instead of 1.14.0).\r\nThe same issue presented itself with the same exact behavior. I am reproducing it with the latest master.\r\n\r\nMight be that you updated the various model templates used within ludwig and it's trying to restore a checkpoint with a different template than the one that was used to generate it?\r\nIt seems as it could just be a different naming convention on that optimizer, but I'm not skilled enough to trace it back to the real reason.\r\n\r\nI don't think it will be easily fixable, or simply I think you won't be willing to fix that, since it would break compatibility with 0.2+, unless you can find a workaround to be able to support\\load both
