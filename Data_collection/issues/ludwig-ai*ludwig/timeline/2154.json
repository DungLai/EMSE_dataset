But we plan on applying the same logic to automl as well. (cc @jeffreyftang)\r\n\r\nIn general, I would say that if you are using GPUs for training, you only really need to think about the GPU resources per trial (we typically set the number of CPUs Ray can see to 0 on GPU workers). Because we use step-based training by default, it's usually sufficient to use 1 GPU per trial in most cases (there is also experimental support for dynamically adding GPUs to trials as other trials are pruned when using hyperband, this is not currently enabled by default in automl, but you can turn it on by editing the `backend` section of the config).\r\n\r\nFor the total number of GPUs in the cluster, in general the more GPUs you have the more trials you can get through in the time limit, so it's strictly better to have more GPUs if you can afford to in most cases. For Ludwig automl, it's expected that you will likely not be able to get through all samples within the time limit, so the decision is mostly about how much you want to spend / allocate for the job. @amholler might be able to provide more empirical data on how best to set the total number of GPUs per automl job.\r\n\r\nIf your dataset is large (O(100GB)) I recommend maintaining a separate pool of CPU workers for doing preprocessing and data loading, and using [windowing](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/0.5/configuration/backend/#loader) to improve data loading throughput among the different trials. In general, the CPU workers should have a high ratio of RAM to CPUs, and allocate about half the available memory to the Ray object store.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1158948080/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6829515359,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5L3o7fzwAAAAGXEiJf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829515359","actor":{"login":"jeffreyftang","id":810895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreyftang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-17T14:49:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6829515364,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5L3o7fzwAAAAGXEiJk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829515364","actor":{"login":"jeffreyftang","id":810895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreyftang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreyftang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-17T14:49:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6829515373,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5L3o7fzwAAAAGXEiJt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829515373","actor":{"login":"amholler","id":86269492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjY5NDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86269492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler","html_url":"https://github.com/amholler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amholler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-17T14:49:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6829515378,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5L3o7fzwAAAAGXEiJy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6829515378","actor":{"login":"amholler","id":86269492,"node_id":"MD

created an issue https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2154 in the past and get some clues. When I get my hands dirty, I feel it's still hard.\r\n\r\nI tried to read files remotely and notice ray dataset consumes lots of memory and may lead to OOM issue. \r\nCurrently, each trial consumes 1 cpu. then total cpu available decides the parallelism. However, in this case, it's hard to estimate the memory usage. compute pod (I use kubernetes) will be killed due to OOM issue easily.\r\n\r\nSeems we can limit the parallelism by setting `hyperopt.executor.max_concurrent_trials` but the side effect is the rest CPU would be  idle? \r\n\r\nI am using CPU to process and train tabular data. Is there an easy formula to calculate the resource estimation? \r\n\r\n\r\nHere's one case I meet OOM issue\r\nresource: cpu 8 core, memory 8G. This is an example to read `rotten_tomatoes.csv`.
