fixes.\r\n- Fixes `default` parameter deprecation warnings.\r\n- Fixes `description` metadata deprecation warnings.\r\n- Fixes last danglers from https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1616\r\n- Removes `get_all_optimizer_json_schemas()`, which was unused and superfluous.\r\n- Rename common argument `nullable` to `allow_none` to be consistent with marshmallow naming.\r\n- Changes numeric custom types (`PositiveInteger`, `NonNegativeInteger`, `NonnegativeFloat`, `IntegerRange`, `FloatRange`) to be more flexible with `allow_none`. Currently, if you set the default of e.g. a `PositiveInteger` to be non-null value like `128`, this automatically prevents `None` from being a valid value for that field. But we want this in some cases, e.g. `bn_virtual_bs` on `TabNet` schema in which setting that field to `None` actually disables it.\r\n- Updates `bn_virtual_bs`.\r\n- Replaces default placeholder text for marshmallow fields with empty string. Sets all occurrences of \"TODO: Document parameters\" to empty string as well.\r\n\r\n### Only merge after https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/1963","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
