tried to replicate the issue, but was not able to.\r\nCould you please try a couple things to see if they solve your issue? In that case i would at least have narrowed down the issue.\r\n\r\n1. Can you please do clean install of ludwig with a new virtual environment using `virtualenv` instead of `pyenv` and `pipenv`? Here my suspicion is that there are some differences in the way those tools install matplotlib that have the effect of not providing you with `TKAgg`.\r\n\r\n2. If that doesn't work, can you try replacing the backend with `MacOSX`? If that works I can add in the code several attempts, to load tkagg, then macosx and finaly agg and raise the error only if non of them loads.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/664043198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
