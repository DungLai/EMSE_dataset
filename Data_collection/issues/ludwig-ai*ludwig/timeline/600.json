- Here is what I mean. Let's say I start with 10000 rows with 100 columns/features. I build the model file with all the 100 columns specified and run my model. If I want to remove say few columns (say 5) to check how the performance is affected, I believe I need to create a new csv with those 5 columns removed from the csv as well as model file. What I meant was, if there's a quick way to run ludwig by simply setting a avoid or disable flag in model file [So I retain the same csv for many such experiments, but toggle columns on and off in the model file or run command]. \r\n\r\nBut your question makes me think, if I don't explicitly include the column in model file, would it be automatically ignored (which is what I
