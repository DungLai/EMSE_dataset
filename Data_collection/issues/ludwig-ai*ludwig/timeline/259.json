Does the order and value matter? (meaning is 1 closer to 2 than it is to 20, for instance)\r\nIf the different integers represent different classes, you should use `sequence` as datatype. If the values and ordering do matter, then I'm curious to know about your usecase, but what I would do is to obtain the floats and then I would just ceil the obtained values after receiving them from Ludwig.\r\nIf there is a strong reason for, i could potentially add a 'ceil' parameter to the numerical output, but I would need to understand the usecase well first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/478282341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241205784,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTIwNTc4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2241205784","actor":{"login":"SachitNayak","id":7900169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDAxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7900169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak","html_url":"https://github.com/SachitNayak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T19:37:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241205785,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDEyMDU3ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2241205785","actor":{"login":"SachitNayak","id":7900169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDAxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7900169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak","html_url":"https://github.com/SachitNayak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T19:37:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241205838,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNDEyMDU4Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2241205838","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T19:37:55Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241262921,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTI2MjkyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludw

this sounds like a each horse is it's own category, you could replace those integers with the unique name of the horse and it would be the same, meaning integers in this case are just IDs of entities. For this reason, `sequence` is the right choice. In order to use it, you need one column containing the names of the horses separated by space. If the names are integer ids, or strings or any other thing, it doesn't matter, they will be treated like strings. So for instance, one possible values is `horse2 horse7 horse1 horse3 horse4`. The edit distance is a generic measure of distance between discrete sequences, in this case it would be useful for you to understand how far the prediction of the model is from the true sequence, 5 would mean it's completely off, 0 means it's perfect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/478294645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241268996,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTI2ODk5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2241268996","actor":{"login":"SachitNayak","id":7900169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDAxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7900169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak","html_url":"https://github.com/SachitNayak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T22:26:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241268997,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDEyNjg5OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2241268997","actor":{"login":"SachitNayak","id":7900169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDAxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7900169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak","html_url":"https://github.com/SachitNayak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SachitNayak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-30T22:26:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/478294683","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/259#issuecomment-478294683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/259","id":478294683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODI5NDY4Mw==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-30T22:27:30Z","updated_at":"2019-03-30T22:27:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Anyway
