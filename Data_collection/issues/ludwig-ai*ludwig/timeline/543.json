I may have figured it out while reading another timeseries ticket but here is what I would like to accomplish. \r\nI am using 1 min data in an attempt to predict 5 mins into the future.

Then compare the two results in order to see if it provides a more accurate 5 min forecast. \r\nWith that said, while reading another ticket you mentioned the market was a level 2 chaos system.
