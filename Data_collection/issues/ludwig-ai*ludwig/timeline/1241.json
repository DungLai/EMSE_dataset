It took a little bit to get around to seeing this, but here I am :) This is the slots_probabilities array I get when parsing the utterance `it is a nice day`: `[0.99996495, 0.9998147 , 0.99985003, 0.9999442 , 0.99750584,\\n 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768,\\n 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768,\\n 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.38254768, 0.382547]` I expected to have an array that displayed only 5 values, one for each slot, outputting each slot probability.\r\n> \r\n> Also, this is the slots_probability for the same utterance: `-0.0029234159737825394` I for sure did not expect a negative value here.\r\n> \r\n> I'll look some more into this since it's now a thing I need to quickly fix and use, and hopefully I'll find the culprit :) Any help is much appreciated!\r\n\r\nHey @carlogrisetti ! I believe here the issue is with the naming scheme we are adopting and some implicit things not made explicit. @justinxzhao tagging you here FYI because you worked on this recently and so that we could decide to both do something about it in the code directly and / or document this better.\r\n\r\nRegarding the slots_probabilities, my best intuition right now is telling me that the length of that vector is the fixed length of the slots in the training set, or the max length within the batch or the specified max_sequence_length preprocessing parameter.\r\nWhat this means in practice is that only the first k probabilities are relevant, the other slots are PADs that get trimmed. In your example the first 5 .90+ probabilities are associated to each othe words, the rest should be ignored. I believe we should be returning also the LENGTHS, so one should be able to use those to identify the length of the probabilties for each vector, like slot_probabilities[:slot_length].\r\n\r\nThe question for us is if we need to fix this and trim to the right length. @justinxzhao wdyt?\r\n\r\nRegarding slots_probability being negative, what is reported there is actually the logprobability of the entire sequence, so it can be negative. You could obtain a regular probability by exponentiating it, but the probability of entire sequences is usually very very low (because of a big vocabulary and many options for each element of the sequence), so logprobability is usually preferred as it can be used to rank multiple possible sequences and doesn't suffer potential underflow issues that the regualr probability woudl suffer.\r\n\r\nhere we need probably to: 1) verify that the log probability is calculated considering only the first LENGTH tokens of the sequence, and 2) make clear in the docs the fact that it's log probability.\r\n\r\n> ... and I seem to have tracked the change happening in a commit that @tgaddair did a year ago here: [651db58#diff-7e8779090e112c98d6b3730e70529a77a4bbc44d84ce469c2c066f7120df0752](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/commit/651db586204097a595df2bbc089d50fa58278288#diff-7e8779090e112c98d6b3730e70529a77a4bbc44d84ce469c2c066f7120df0752)\r\n> \r\n> Did not verify yet that prior to this it is not happening, but seeing the code it seems that's exactly the place where it changed from being 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional, but something went wrong in the aggregation of values :)\r\n> \r\n> Might be something wrong with this function: https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/tf-legacy/ludwig/features/sequence_feature.py#L470-L483\r\n\r\nReturning the 3d probabilties (all the probabilities of all the possible elements of the sequence) could be problematic in many cases, for isntance if one has a generator and a vocab of 10000, is it would return batch_size x sequence length x 10000. But, for most tagging usecases (as opposed to generation ones) the vocabulary is not that large.\r\nSo we could do a couple things:\r\n1) return 3d probabilties additionally to the other ones for tegger decoders. We should probably find a better naming, something like each_token_probabilties, best_sequence_rpobabilties, sequence_logprobability maybe? With a flag users can turn off.\r\n2) adding an optional flag for returning 3d probabilties also for the generator (default would be false, but the user may turn it on)\r\n\r\nWould that work for

@carlogrisetti and @w4nderlust ,\r\n\r\n@geoffreyangus may have run into a related (perhaps identical) issue on Ludwig 0.5.dev, and Geoffrey has landed a fix for computing sequence probabilities on master (#1904).\r\n\r\nIIRC, the original code (from tf-legacy) is buggy because item assignment is different between lists and np.arrays, and the probability calculation isn't done correctly if the
