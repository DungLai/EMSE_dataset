How to quantify whan constitutes a good prediction depends on your problem and also depends on the range of values you are trying to predict. If you values are between 0 and 10 and the MAE is  5, that's a pretty bad prediction and 0.5 would be a relatively good prediction, but if you values are between 0 and 1, 0.5 MAE would be pretty bad.\r\nDoes this answer you
