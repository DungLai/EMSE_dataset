I think I should use predict command to use the train model on the test data. So I wrote the following command:\r\n> \r\n> ludwig predict --data_set test.csv --model_path 'path of json file'\r\n> \r\n\r\nThe `model_path` parameter does not refer to the json file.  This parameter refers to the `model` sub-directory.  For example, if you run with the default settings for the parameters: `experiment_name`, `model_name` and `output_directory`, you should see the following directory structures:\r\n```\r\nresults/\r\n    experiment_run/\r\n        model/\r\n```\r\nNote the above is only a subset of what will be created.  Also note that the sub-directory `experiment_run` is the concatenation of the `experiment_name` and `model_name` parameters.    the `--model_path` parameter should point to `--model_path results/experiment_run/model`\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Ludwig user guide](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/user_guide/#predict) for details.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this answered your question.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/800694436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4467449390,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2NzQ0OTM5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4467449390","actor":{"login":"muhammad-yasir","id":25621662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjIxNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25621662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammad-yasir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T00:06:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4467449394,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0Njc0NDkzOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4467449394","actor":{"login":"muhammad-yasir","id":25621662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjIxNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25621662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir","html_url":"https://github.com/muhammad-yasir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhammad-yasir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T00:06:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4467449977,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ0Njc0NDk5Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4467449977","actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":
