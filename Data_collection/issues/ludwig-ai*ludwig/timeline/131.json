The tool is not \"hyped\" as code-free, it **IS** code free, it makes a lot of difference. Code-free **doesn't mean** machine-learning-knowledge-free.\r\n\r\nPlus which loss is used for each feature is explicitly documented in the user guide. For instance by default category features have `softmax_cross_entropy` and [this](https://deepnotes.io/softmax-crossentropy) is the first result you find on google, which explains everything about it. Regarding `hits_at_k`, you can google that too and get [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01476.pdf) as second result, in the last page there's the definition. S please put a minimal amount of effort and you'll find the answers.\r\n\r\nWe will always try to link to resources in the documentation that explain things, but our goal is to make a tool to make it easy to train models, not a tool for teaching you how to do machine learning and not a tool that doesn't require any machine learning knowledge to be used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/466152342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2156093189,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE1NjA5MzE4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2156093189","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-21T20:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2156093190,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNTYwOTMxOTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2156093190","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-21T20:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2156094183,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE1NjA5NDE4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2156094183","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-21T20:23:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
