I have been working on understanding Mackey-Glass (MG) equation and generating sequences and time series from them. One of the benefits of using these equations is that the degree of “chaos,” that is the challenge of modeling and predicting the associated TS, can be varied by changing the equation parameters.\n\n \n\nI have some examples that suggest how MG might be used, which I would be happy to share with you.\n\n \n\nThanks again for your response. I will say I am much impressed with Ludwig, which I was touting to my son, who works with ML/AI for Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. I like the range of functionality, from no coding for basic situations, to extending through use of Python features. \n\n \n\nTalk soon.\n\n \n\nDavid L.
