thank you for your questions.\r\nIn the future release of Ludwig there will be a more abstract interface that would allow people to specify their own models more easily.\r\nThat said, Ludwig is a deep learning toolbox at the moment, and we do not plan to add or support non deep learning algorithms in the toolbox at the moment.\r\n(You can do Logistic Regression for sure anyway, just use a binary output feature).\r\nThere are many other libraries that already support all those algorithms like scikit-learn, which works pretty well, so I suggest you to use that instead for non deep learning algorithms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/636555104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3391127502,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM5MTEyNzUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3391127502","actor":{"login":"boulaziz","id":65165826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTY1ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65165826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz","html_url":"https://github.com/boulaziz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-01T00:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3391127504,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzOTExMjc1MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3391127504","actor":{"login":"boulaziz","id":65165826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTY1ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65165826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz","html_url":"https://github.com/boulaziz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boulaziz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-01T00:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3409227199,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MDkyMjcxOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3409227199","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-05T00:33:26Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"008500"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
