for the comments @BenMacKenzie .\r\n.Yes you can change both the fill value, the fill value strategy and the padding value.\r\nThose are all parameters of the timeseries preprocessing.\r\nFill value is the value that is used when in the whole datapoint is missing, padding is the value that is used to fill sequences to the fixed length that is specified.\r\nI should probably make it more explicit in the documentation, I say timeseries are treated in the same way of the sequences ([here](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#time-series-features-preprocessing)), but I should also add that you can use the same preprocessing parameters, specified [here](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#sequence-features-preprocessing).\r\nClosing this for now, let me know if there are other prprocessing parameters that would be useful in your use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/471146468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2191622664,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE5MTYyMjY2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2191622664","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-09T05:07:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2191622666,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5MTYyMjY2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2191622666","actor":{"login":"BenMacKenzie","id":1110151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1110151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie","html_url":"https://github.com/BenMacKenzie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-09T05:07:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2191622667,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTE2MjI2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2191622667","actor":{"login":"BenMacKenzie","id":1110151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1110151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie","html_url":"https://github.com/BenMacKenzie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-09T05:07:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/471169472","html_url":"https://github.com/l
