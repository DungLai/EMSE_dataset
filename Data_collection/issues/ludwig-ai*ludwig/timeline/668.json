You have a lot of flexibility: you can have one set of weights to encode timeseiries that is different for each time series and then combine them, or you can combine them first and encode all together with one set of weights. You can also first encode with timeseries specific weights and then combine with an additional set of weights.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, you need to create one input feature for each timeseries, you can use different encoders for ech feature if you prefer, or you can use the same encoder with the same weights using the `tied_weights`. mechanism.\r\nIn the second case you need one input feature for each timeseries setting the `encoder: passthrough` and using a a sequence combiner `combiner: {type: sequence, encoder: yourchoice}`.\r\nFor the third case, you can specify both the encoders for each timeseries feature and also the sequence combiner.\r\n\r\nFor more details i suggest you to red the [sequence](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#sequence-features), [timeseries](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#time-series-features), and [sequence combiner](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#sequence-combiner) section in the user guide.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have further questions, otherwise I can close

that sounds like a nice way to do preprocessing for timeseries. We do something similar for audio features, they can be used both raw or processed, we could do the same for timeseries data, adding an optional preprocessing in Ludwig that calls this library. Would that be useful for you? Do you think you would be able to contribute something like this if I give you precise instructions?\r\nLet me

So the first instruction I can give you is to look at audio_feature.py specifically those lines: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/features/audio_feature.py#L134-L140 . The way it works is that if `raw` is specified, the input audio signal is left untouched,, and it's basically a univariate timeseries. If another type of preprocessing is specified, then `soundfile` is called and the output is a matrix instead.\r\nI think the same can be done with the library you suggested. Let me know if that is not the case after looking at the implementation of the audio feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/606379133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/607002291","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/668#issuecomment-607002291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/668","id":607002291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzAwMjI5MQ==","user":{"login":"Jim2002","id":5688571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODg1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5688571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002","html_url":"https://github.com/Jim2002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jim2002/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-01T03:12:32Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T03:12:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust I finished reading through the sections from the user guide, I'm not sure if I understand it corrently but I tried building the first case model you mentioned, one input feature for each timeseries, with the same encoder with the same weights using the tied_weights. mechanism.

this is correct, the same weights are used to encode with an lstm all 4 features. Then they are reduced and concatenated (by default concat combiner is used, you can search for it in the user guide), and finally the binary classification is performed.
