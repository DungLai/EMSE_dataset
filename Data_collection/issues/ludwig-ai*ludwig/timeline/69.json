so you are running the visualize command  from the colab, you are not calling the functions themselves.

Do you have experience in doing something like this (calling scripts that open mtplotlib windows and having them rendered in colab cells)?\r\n\r\nThis is making me think that probably I should add an option to `visualize` that allows for saving the images to disk instead of opening windows. That would solve your problem as you would be able to open the saved images in a cell, and also @MrRace 's problem (if if I don't know yet what his problem was in detail).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463412078/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2138198637,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzODE5ODYzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2138198637","actor":{"login":"MrRace","id":10300313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10300313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace","html_url":"https://github.com/MrRace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T23:04:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138198639,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzgxOTg2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2138198639","actor":{"login":"MrRace","id":10300313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10300313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace","html_url":"https://github.com/MrRace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrRace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T23:04:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2138199106,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxMzgxOTkxMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2138199106","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T23:04:59Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463423469","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/69#issuecomment-463423469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig
