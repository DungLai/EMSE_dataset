version of #2811\r\n\r\nBy default, set `validation_metric` to the first output feature type's `default_validation_metric`.\r\n\r\nNew logic for setting validation parameters:\r\n- If the user has explicitly set `validation_field`, don't override any validation parameters.\r\n- If only `validation_metric` is explicitly set, then we determine the proper `validation_field` for the user, for example to handle the case where the user specifies `accuracy` but forgets to change the `validation_field` to the name of the feature that produces `accuracy` metrics.\r\n- if the `validation_metric` is invalid for all output features, then  we raise an error.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the `_user_config` as an additional attribute to the `ModelConfig` object. `ModelConfig._user_config` might not work totally correctly on model re-load, but probably still a worthwhile change.\r\n\r\nCloses
