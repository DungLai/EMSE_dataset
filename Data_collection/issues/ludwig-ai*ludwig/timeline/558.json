https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#parallel-cnn-encoder.\r\n\r\nDeeper description of the built model can be obtained if logging level is\r\nset to `DEBUG` when trainig.\r\n\r\nFinally if you want to know all the operations that are happening in the\r\nmodel, grouped by feature, you can look at the tensorboard grap tab. You\r\nhave to call the tensorboard command specifying the model path and\r\nappending `/log` to the path like:\r\n```\r\ntensorboard --logdir results/experiment_run_0/model/log\r\n```\r\nreplace the path with the one you obtained when training.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have further doubts.\r\n\r\nP.S. Thank you @manesioz for helping answering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/549298780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2767206280,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NzIwNjI4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2767206280","actor":{"login":"manesioz","id":38442944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDQyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38442944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz","html_url":"https://github.com/manesioz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T10:40:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2767206282,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjcyMDYyODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2767206282","actor":{"login":"manesioz","id":38442944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDQyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38442944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz","html_url":"https://github.com/manesioz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manesioz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T10:40:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2767206993,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NjcyMDY5OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2767206993","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-04T10:41:14Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"f9d0c4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/552671967","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/558#issuecomment-552671967","issue_u
