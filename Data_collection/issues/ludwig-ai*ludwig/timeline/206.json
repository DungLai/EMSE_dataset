That representation could be passed through fc_layers, at the moment it isn't. So I guess your feature request is to add additional fc_layers on top of the rnn (and I guess also the cnnrnn) encoder. Will add it to the backlog.\r\nAnyway, depending on how the decoder side of your model works, you can add fc_layers at the beginning of the decoder that would have exactly the same function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/472246632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2198931902,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxOTg5MzE5MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2198931902","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T01:43:41Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/472408926","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/206#issuecomment-472408926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/206","id":472408926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjQwODkyNg==","user":{"login":"BenMacKenzie","id":1110151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1110151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie","html_url":"https://github.com/BenMacKenzie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenMacKenzie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T12:51:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T12:54:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks @w4nderlust i wouldn't give this one a very high priority since as you point out adding fc_layers at beginning of de-coder achieves the same result (which is in fact what i did).  it was more a conceptual point to make sure i wasn't missing something.
