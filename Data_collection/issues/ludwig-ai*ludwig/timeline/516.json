For instance `learning_curves` needs the training statistics file and you cna see you have a file `training_statistics.json` and likewise for predictions, probabilities and so on.\r\nIn the [visualization section](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#visualizations) of the user guide you can find examples of the commands, the API uses exactly the same name and parameters, so it should be easy to figure it out.
