for GANs at the moment there is no specific support, but regarding autoencoders, it depends on the type of data you want to autoencoder: any datatype that is supported for both input and output features. The only caveat is that currently Ludwig doesn't support multiple features to be defined with the same column name, so you would have to copy a column, change its name and then write a model accordingly.\r\nFor instance, for text the data it would look like:\r\n```\r\ntext_input,text_output\r\nhello world,hello world\r\nmy name is,my name is\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAnd the model definition would look like:\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n  -\r\n    name: text_input\r\n    type: text\r\noutput_features:\r\n  -\r\n    name: text_output\r\n    type: text\r\n```\r\nHope this help

I understand the need. For the encoder part, you can use the `collect activations` command for obtaining the latent representations, but at the moment there is no way to actually provide a latent representation for the decoder to perform the generation.\r\nGiven TensorFlow's fixed graph structure is currently a bit difficult to change Ludwig to accomodate your usecase, but once we move to TensorFlow 2 it will become much easier and we will try to address this usecase.\r\nConsider it may take a little while for that to happen as we have currently other priorities for v0.3, so my best estimate at the moment is that it will happen by v0.4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/538609624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2689042483,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY4OTA0MjQ4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2689042483","actor":{"login":"Kantshun","id":31396222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzk2MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31396222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun","html_url":"https://github.com/Kantshun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-05T02:43:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2689042484,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2ODkwNDI0ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2689042484","actor":{"login":"Kantshun","id":31396222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzk2MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31396222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun","html_url":"https://github.com/Kantshun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kantshun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-05T02:43:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
