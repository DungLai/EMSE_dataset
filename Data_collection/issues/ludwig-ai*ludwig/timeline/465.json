update: I tested training a model with those same embeddings and then loading it with `model_load_path` to train a new model on the same data and it works fine.\r\nI guess that your problem stems from the fact that you are using a different dataset, with a different vocabulary size. When you specify pretrained embeddings, ludwig intersects the vocabulary in the embeddings file with the vocabulary in the training data and keeps only those embeddings in the intersection and initialized the ones that are in the training data and are not in the embeddings file. So the resulting matrix can have a different size than the embeddings file (usually smaller, but in some cases it could be bigger).\r\nWhen you try to train a new dataset, the vocabulary size is different so the size of the embedding matrix within the model would not match.\r\nI'm thinking about what could be a good strategy for those cases, will keep you posted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/539711212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/539807347","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/465#issuecomment-539807347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/465","id":539807347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTgwNzM0Nw==","user":{"login":"abc1110","id":52369469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110","html_url":"https://github.com/abc1110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-09T03:27:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T05:27:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust \r\nThanks a lot of the update.

yes, at the moment that's the best solution. The main reason is the difference in the vocabularies of the datasets, which means difference in size of the embedding matrix. I could actually make it so that the vocabulary keeps being the one of the first model, but then all new words that don't appear in the old datasets would be mapped to `<UNK>` which, depending on the amount of overlap of the two vocabularies, could be much worse than just training on the concatenation of the datasets.\r\nI'm now considering a solution where the new vocabulary is calculated, the union with the old vocabulary is performed, the words in the old vocabulary already have vectors and they are kept while the new words have randomly initialized vectors. This seems like the best solution, but implementing it in TF1 is not triviel, because i for loading the pre-trained model I just do\r\n```\r\nif self.weights_save_path:\r\n    self.restore(session, self.weights_save_path)\r\n```\r\nwhich is definitely not sufficient.\r\nI may end up postponing this change until after porting to TF2, as it could make it much easier.\r\n\r\nAlso, just to clarify, the issue does not depend on the fact that you originally loaded the embeddings, it depends on the way the embedding matrix is constructed in Ludwig (so I'm changing the title of the

i thought of a possible solution, please let me know if it is a good enough workaround.\r\nI can add an additional parameter `use_pretrained_embedding_vocab: false`. If set to false, the behavior is the current one. If set to true, instead of using the vocabulary of the training data, the vocabulary of the pre-trained embeddings will be used. This will make the model most likely much larger (because all millions of embedding from the glove file will be loaded for instance), and all words that are in the training set, but do not appear in the pre-trained embeddings vocabulary will be mapped to `<UNK>`. This shouldn't be a huge problem because the vocabulary of the pre-trained embeddings is usually pretty large and comprehensive. Then when you load a pretrained model trained in this way, I will add a check so that the vocabulary of the pre-trained model will be used. This is also a relatively generic solution because, even if you don't specify pre-trained embeddings, when loading a pre-trained ludwig model, there will not be errors like the one you are experiencing. The only last corner case would be when the user specifies both a pre-trained model to load and pre-trained embeddings to load. In this case, the pre-trained Ludwig model will have priority.\r\nI know it's a bit confusing for someone who doesn't know much about Ludwig internals, but at least from the point of view of functionality, does this makes sense to you?

ended up implementing a  cleaner and simpler solution.\r\nNow you can specify you glove file also as vocabulary, Ludwig will use only the first column as entry in the vocabulary. This way, when you specify a pre-trained glove file you can decide to use its entire vocabulary instead of the interaction between what's in the training data and what's in the glova vocabulary like it happens now.\r\nIn your use case, it means you will load the pre-trained embeddings, use the full vocabulary, save the model, load it as a pre-trained model and the whole vocabulary will be used also when you finetune on the new data.\r\nTo achieve this you have to change your YAML as follows:\r\n```yaml\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: text\r\n        type: text\r\n        level: word\r\n        encoder: stacked_parallel_cnn\r\n        embedding_size: 50\r\n        pretrained_embeddings: /home/abc/mystuff/datasets/glove.6b.50d.txt\r\n        preprocessing:\r\n            word_vocab_file: /home/abc/mystuff/datasets/glove.6b.50d.txt\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: class\r\n        type: category\r\n\r\ntraining:\r\n    -\r\n        early_stop: 10\r\n```\r\nThis will train a model with the full glove vocabulary. Then when you load this model with `load_model_path` to train on new data, the vocabulary in the new data would not be considered, and the full glove vocabulary from the pre-trained model will be used.\r\nI suggest you to set `embeddings_on_cpu: true` when you use glove embeddings and vocabulary, as otherwise they may exceed the size of the memory of your GPU.\r\nThis should solve your issue. Please feel free to post or reopen if there are further problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/540848439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/540956441","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/465#issuecomment-540956441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/465","id":540956441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDk1NjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"abc1110","id":52369469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110","html_url":"https://github.com/abc1110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abc1110/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T07:51:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T07:51:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust Thanks for the YAML code, I will try and implement it on my dataset and give an update if it works or not.
