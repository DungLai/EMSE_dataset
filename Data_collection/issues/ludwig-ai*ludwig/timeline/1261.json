The line numbers cited in the stack trace, coincide with Ludwig v0.2.x\r\n```\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ludwig/features/base_feature.py\", line 21, in <module>\r\n    from ludwig.models.modules.recurrent_modules import reduce_sequence\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ludwig/models/modules/recurrent_modules.py\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    from tensorflow.contrib.rnn import MultiRNNCell, LSTMStateTuple\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.contrib'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line numbers in the stack trace do not match code in Ludwig v0.3 and later.  \r\n\r\nIt appears your software environment may not be correct.\r\n\r\nif you run `pip list | grep ludwig` what does it show?

In your case, it appears `pip` is falling back to cached older versions of ludwig.  \r\n\r\n@michaelbzhu @Peetee06 @victoriayue   Assuming the software environment you are using is one where you ran older versions of ludwig, I think there are couple options.\r\n\r\n**Option 1**  install ludwig 0.4 with `pip install --no-cache-dir ludwig==0.4`.  This should prevent `pip` from searching it's cache.\r\n\r\n**Option 2** clean out the local `pip` cache of any older versions of ludwig, look at the `pip cache` command: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_cache/\r\n\r\nThe options are not mutually exclusive,  you can do both.\r\n\r\nIf these options do not provide a solution, the next step will be to debug your install of ludwig.  For that it will be helpful to post the full output from the `pip install` of ludwig.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/901022848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5174121685,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE3NDEyMTY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5174121685","actor":{"login":"Peetee06","id":17020705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDIwNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17020705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06","html_url":"https://github.com/Peetee06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-18T11:04:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5174121687,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNzQxMjE2ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5174121687","actor":{"login":"Peetee06","id":17020705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDIwNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17020705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06","html_url":"https://github.com/Peetee06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peetee06/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-18T11:04:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5174121691,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE3NDEyMTY5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5174121691","actor":{"login":"michaelbzhu","id":17104161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA0MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17104161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelbzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelbzhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-18T11:04:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5174121694,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNzQxMjE2OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/even
