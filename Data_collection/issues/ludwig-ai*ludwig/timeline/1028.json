right now there is no mechanism in Ludwig to load a model trained with a different model definition (even if only different by one feature) as a starting point for another model.\r\nWhat happens in your case is that the model definition of the model you are loading is what ends up being used instead.\r\nSo yes, this is expected behavior right now.\r\n\r\nI guess we can turn this into a feature request.\r\nIf I understand correctly (please confimr) what you would like to happen here is that you would want to load the pieces of the previous model that match with the new model definition ( encoders of feature 0-100 and decoder of the output feature) and randomly initialize the parts that don't match(encoder of feature 101 and the combiner).\r\nThis is interesting and something we may consider in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/735315008/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4048598006,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQwNDg1OTgwMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4048598006","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-29T01:30:17Z","label":{"name":"feature

is probably a feature request that is related to https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1028. I believe overwriting all the model parameters when pretrained model is loaded could be improved. Here's the scenario.\r\nRun 1: Run 100 epochs, set early_stop to be say 10 epochs. Model file is ready now.\r\nRun 2: New data and new model file, but the only change in the model is setting early_stop to be 2 epochs say. Current implementation would simply override the training parameters and can keep running for 100 epoch or early stop: 10 is reached.\r\n\r\nAllowing few parameters such as number of epochs or early stop values to be modified will save time in subsequent runs. I am right now modifying the model_hyperparameters.json file from run 1 to accomplish the same effect. When slow learning rate is used, each epoch can take a lot of time - so earlier stop values on subsequent runs could be helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1049258662","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1028#issuecomment-1049258662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1028","id":1049258662,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs4-imqm","user":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T22:04:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T22:05:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jenishah, thanks for posting your tip.
