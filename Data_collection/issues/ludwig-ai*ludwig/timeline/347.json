Hey, the **(venv)** indicates the virtual environment doesn't it?\r\n\r\nyes but if you don't show me that the venv you created is a python 3 venv by showing either how you created it or what version is the python inside it i can't be sure you are doing things correctly.\r\n\r\n> OK, here is some good news.\r\n> After installation using pip3 instead of pip (and it was successful compared to the other VM still stuck at matplotlib), I can reproduce this output:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ludwig1@ubuntu:~$ python3 -m ludwig.train -h\r\n> ```\r\nNow it looks again that you outside the virtual environment. If you are withing a virtual environment initialized with python3 as the interpreter you don't need to use the python3 command but just the python command. Also I don't know in which directory you are when you are running this, if you actually have it installed or if you are running it from source, from the directory you pulled.\r\nAs this is getting pretty messy, I suggest you to read some guide on virtual environments, for instance [this one](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) that will probably clarify all your doubts. Also I'm closing this issue as it's likely not a Ludwig issue but an issue with your configuration. You can keep on writing here if you want and I'll keep trying to help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/494503422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2357054824,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM1NzA1NDgyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2357054824","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-21T18:23:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
