I was using FastAPI for the server I was not using `ludwig serve` anymore since this afternoon (Paris time). I tried what you suggested (the import of all the dependencies) and they passed so I tried `ludwig serve` again and it worked this time. However what I noticed when I was installing FastAPI manually is that Pydantic causes some problems during the installation and you have to try many times (I had to use sudo -H at some point). So my best guess is that when you install FastAPI with `pip install ludwig[serve]` there's a dependency that doesn't install correctly hence causing the other problems, which is weird because in my dump from the installation all the dependencies are supposedly successfully installed. \r\n\r\nThanks for your prompt answer and help with this matter.
