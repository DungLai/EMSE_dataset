me give you some context, hopefully it will help clarify.\r\nIf you have a dataset where all datapoints have output labels, and you provide a full csv, when you run `experiment` Ludwig splits it in train validation and test set randomly (70% - 10% 20% respectively, this values can be changed).\r\nWhen you run train, the at the end of each epoch the model is used to predict on the training set and on the test set. During training the process may stop due to early stopping, like in your case.\r\nAt the end of the whole training, Ludwig uses the best model found so far (which may be not the one obtained during the last epoch) and uses it to obtain predictions and statistics on the test set.\r\nSo, the scores that you see at the end are the same obtained by the model at 18, as it was the model with the best validation loss. You also obtain a number of additional measures in some cases, like in the case of categorical or sequence features, where the confusion matrix is computed and per class statistics are reported. In the case of numerical features, like in your case, there are currently no additional measures than the ones computed during the training phase, so if you don't need the predictions, there is no need to run `experiment` you can run just `train`, but running experiment also produces a `test_statistics.json` file that can be used for obtaining visualizations, so you may want to do that anyway, depending on your needs.\r\nClosing this as it is not an issue, feel free to ask further questions in this thread even if it
