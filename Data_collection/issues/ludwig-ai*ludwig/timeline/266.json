provide a fully reproducible example for us to look into (sample of the csv, yaml file, command).\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's likely that you have really big images and you are not resizing them through Ludwig's preprocessing, and that makes cuda go out of memory. Try to add:\r\n```\r\npreprocessing:\r\n    height: 28\r\n    width: 28\r\n```\r\nto your image feature. This will make the images 28x28 which should be small enough.

Also consider that the default batch size in ludwig is 128, for bigger images you may want to decrease it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/479211579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2247972698,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNDc5NzI2OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2247972698","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-02T21:30:13Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/479225097","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/266#issuecomment-479225097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/266","id":479225097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTIyNTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"Felix-N","id":1209409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1209409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N","html_url":"https://github.com/Felix-N","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felix-N/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T22:04:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T22:05:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i've limited the test dataset to 90 images, and using this as the model yaml:\r\n(changed size from 128 to 28 and tested again -
