the usage doesn't differ at all from the CLI, the functions are exactly the same and the arguments are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe work that needs to be done is the following: each function of the visualization module performs loading of files, data manipulation and visualization of the manipulated data. At the moment the functions for visualization are separate (`utils/visualization_utils.py`), but the current functions in the `visualize` module do both loading and data manipulation. Those two operations need to be separated so that one would programmatically call only the function that calculates the logic with that that has already been loaded.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the `learning_curves` function would need to get as input, instead of a list of files, just the data columns needed, and an outer function should load files and call this inner function as many times as needed. This will make for a clean
