can always split the video input in frames and process each single one separately or, if you need some sort of correlation between two frames as in your example, process a single \"composite\" frame N-fold in width with the second, third, fourth, nth frame pasted after each other.\r\nYou can just use numpy with something like  np.concatenate((frame1, frame2), axis=1) to have a single array with all the frames stitched together.\r\nIn your example you can have 29 frames stitched together as input data, and the 30th frame as output and train based on those, but as of now there are no image output features, so it would basically be a numerical array output.\r\n\r\nThat's how I would approach that, taken that you only have access to the current
