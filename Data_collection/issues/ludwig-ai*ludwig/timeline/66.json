definitely.\r\nWhat I suggest you to do is to take a dataset and train a model with ludwig first. Take one of the examples in on the website, maybe text classification. I suggest you to put beakpoints everywhere in the preprocessing.py script to see what actually happens during the preprocessing, for instance how metadata is obtained and how preprocessing parameters are used and how the final data transformation id performed. You'll notice that each feature type has its own features that implement those things. I would suggest to begin with to llok just at a couple of them, for instance sequence (which is medium complex) and category (which is medium easy). Numerical and binary are the easiest, while images and audio are the most complex at the moment.\r\nAnother thing you will notice is the use of caching with HDF5 files for processed data and JSON files for metadata.\r\nAfter you have an understanding of how the whole process work, you'll realize what makes it kinda tricky to extend the current design with additional data formats.\r\nFinally, if you look a that branch that I pointed you to, you'll see a sketch of the design that I would like to follow to make preprocessing more flexibly with pluggable data formats a preprocessing strategies.\r\nAfter you get to that point for sure you'll have a lot of questions. Feel free to reach out to me privately and I can answer all of them (that's just for sparing the github issue with posts).\r\nAfter you have a clear picture we can define together specific tasks to perform.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/618829515/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/700346029","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/66#issuecomment-700346029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/66","id":700346029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDM0NjAyOQ==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T00:05:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T00:05:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This has been recently added.
