good... but there's the annoying warning popping up on model load when trying to predict... and in that case the stratify parameter means absolutely nothing so it shouldn't even be checked for.\r\nIt all works fine however, so it's just an aesthetic improvement on the outputs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/682563052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carlogrisetti","id":4464640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQ2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4464640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti","html_url":"https://github.com/carlogrisetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlogrisetti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/683345715","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/850#issuecomment-683345715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/850","id":683345715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzM0NTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-29T21:51:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T21:51:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"mmm yes that same code is called when the model is loaded too and if stratify is outside inputs and outputs it will complain. i may replace stratify with none at saving time, but I don't know if the model will be loaded and trained again, in which case stratify may be useful.\r\nSo I would say let's live with that, and if you are very sure you don't want to train that model again, substitute the value of stratify with none in model definition inside the model directory you load from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/683345715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3753877965,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3NTM4Nzc5NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3753877965","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3aa8de6ef7b0a18f2487555b874f2aa38f6101ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/commits/3aa8de6ef7b0a18f2487555b874f2aa38f6101ee","created_at":"2020-09-11T01:36:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3780435292,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODA0MzUyOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3780435292","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b7a1ade7b7ac4c835f31877cd532d3fe0deb1bbc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/commits/b7a1ade7b7ac4c835f31877cd532d3fe0deb1bbc","created_at":"2020-09-18T00:43:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
