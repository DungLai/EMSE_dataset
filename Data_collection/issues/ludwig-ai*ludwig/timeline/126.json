Combined combines them, meaning if i have two category features, each of them have their own accuracy, and combined accuracy tells me what is the proportion of datapoints where I do correct predictions for BOTH features AT THE SAME TIME. If you think at correct predictions as a list of booleans as long as your datapoints fo each feature, combined calculates the accuracy on the `logical and`  of those two lists.\r\nIt's useful because if you have multiple output features, you may want to validate on this measure rather than on each independent one.\r\n\r\nSome other features, like numerical ones, do not have a notion of accuracy, they have ther mse, mae and r2. When validating on multiple output features that do not have a notion of accuracy, the combined loss value on the validation set is used instead. Basically that accuracy is never computed nor it is used for decisions and doesn't represent how well the model is performing. In your case how well are the models performing is representented by loss, which is the sum of the mse of both (or the sum of whatever loss you specified) weighted by the weight that you specify for each (by default 1).\r\n\r\nAn enhancement could be for Ludwig to avoid showing the accuracy column at all if not all the features support it, to avoid the confusion that it can generate, like in your case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/465768979/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2153294362,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNTMyOTQzNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2153294362","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-20T21:51:07Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/466042605","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/126#issuecomment-466042605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/126","id":466042605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjA0MjYwNQ==","user":{"login":"loretoparisi","id":163333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi","html_url":"https://github.com/loretoparisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T15:29:01Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T15:29:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust thank you for the details, it perfectly makes sense.

let me tray to understand your usecase batter. So those numbers that you want to output are between [0,1] but they are not probabilities of a binary classifier, is that correct?\r\n\r\nDepending on that, one solution could be to add a preprocessing parameter like `normalize_01` that performs this normalization at the data level (so it would work for both numerical inputs and numerical features. There could also be a `normalize_zscore` and a `normalize_minmax` normalization strategy, so probably it would be better to have a `normalize` parameter that by default is `None` but then you can pass a string with the name of the normalization strategy (01, maxmin, zscore) and it will adopt that strategy reading it from a normalization strategy registry.\r\n\r\nThis will work at the data level, but there wouldn't be anything in the model to constraint it to produce a value in [0,1]. For that purpose one can think about writing a decoder that clips values before outputting them, or some other strategy (for instance applying a sigmoid). Adding a decoder should be pretty easy, the only difficulty is that sequence features for instance already have a machinery with a registry of decoders that are selected by their name, while numerical features don't have that because so far there has only been one decoder. Adding it would be simple, and probably I should do it for all the features anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
