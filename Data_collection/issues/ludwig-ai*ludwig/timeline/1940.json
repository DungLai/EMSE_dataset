issue 1940: [Twitter bots dataset fails to load most images because 4 channels not supported for JPEG](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1940)\r\n\r\nWhen inferring number of channels for an image dataset, my assumption is that 3 channels is the most common use case.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior to use:\r\n\r\n1 channel if the majority of samples are 1 channel\r\n2 channel if the majority of samples are 2 channel\r\n4 channel if the majority are 4 channel\r\n3 otherwise\r\n\r\nAlso added logging to explain channel inference.  Sample output (twitter bots):\r\n```\r\nInferring num_channels from the first 100 images for column profile_image_path.\r\n  images with 1 channels: 4\r\n  images with 3 channels: 88\r\n  images with 4 channels: 8\r\nUsing 3 channels because it is the majority in sample. If an image with a different depth is read, will attempt to convert to 3 channels.\r\nTo explicitly set the number of channels, define num_channels in the preprocessing dictionary of the image input feature config.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1124360927","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1940#issuecomment-1124360927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1940","id":1124360927,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5DBGLf","user":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-11T22:46:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T22:46:51Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fixed by #1941 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1124360927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6594048794,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5H_AJzzwAAAAGJCTMa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6594048794","actor":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-11T22:46:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
