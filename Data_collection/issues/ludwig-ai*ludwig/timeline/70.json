And why in your case that would be preferable over forking?\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is relatively easy to add this capability, features are just collected in a dictionary registry, so one would just have to add to that registry and it will work, as long as the class implementing the feature respects the input / output interface. The only problem I see with it is that at the moment we just expose `LudwigModel` as our API, in order for what you propose to work we would have to expose also other things like `BaseFeature`, `BaseInputFeature` and `BaseOutputFeature`, as the would need to be used when creating you custom feature. I have to think about the pros and cons of such a choice.\r\n\r\nFinally, i'm curious, what additional feature type are you implementing?

Many actuaries have statistical and insurance knowhow but often coding is not our specialty and some do not code at all. As a member of a working group with the Institute of Actuaries of Australia looking at data analytics, I am interested in anything that can help our members model insurance data such as insurance claims better or easier. \r\n\r\nWhen I came across your package, I could see great potential in this tool for actuaries in two contexts:\r\n* Using the no-coding philosophy for non-coding actuaries (albeit, many of those would prefer having a GUI)\r\n* As a set of convenience functions for more data-science oriented actuaries for quickly setting up a model for predicting anything with anything\r\n\r\nHowever, some things I'm thinking are:\r\n* Insurance claims follow distributions like Poisson, Gamma - for those it would make sense to just add the loss to the NumericalBaseFeature and contribute back.\r\n* I have been experimenting with some unusual actuarial claim model structures which might not be of general interest and planning to write a python package for it to go with a paper - I had started writing up some convenience functions that are similar in concept as yours but much less developed so I am considering whether it would be worthwhile to pivot to use your package instead and build on a stronger base.\r\n\r\nHaving the extensions as part of the API would mean that I can have it as a dependency rather than either maintaining a fork of your codebase or attempting to persuade you to accept a PR that is oddly specific.
