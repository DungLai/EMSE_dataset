@aminaBm , that really depends on your data, setting hyperparameters for your specific use case it's what you have to figure out :) I don't know what you score is but you can clip values, check the documentation.\r\nConversely, if you believe there's a bug that is making the model not working for your usecase, than that's an issue we can try to solve.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there's an error in you model definition, the `optinizer` in your output feature should be `loss` instead, but it should work anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/510220538/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2473825021,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ3MzgyNTAyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2473825021","actor":{"login":"aminaBm","id":10902023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTAyMDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10902023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm","html_url":"https://github.com/aminaBm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-10T20:41:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2473825022,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NzM4MjUwMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2473825022","actor":{"login":"aminaBm","id":10902023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTAyMDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10902023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm","html_url":"https://github.com/aminaBm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminaBm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-10T20:41:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2473825503,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0NzM4MjU1MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2473825503","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-10T20:41:18Z","label":{"name":"waiting
