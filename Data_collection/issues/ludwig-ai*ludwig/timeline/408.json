your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nOther related issues: #408 #251 \r\nI trained a Chinese model for spaCy, linked it to `[spacy's package folder]/data/zh` (using `spacy link`) and want to use that for ludwig. However, when I tried to set the config for ludwig, I received an error, which tell me that there is no way to load the Chinese model.\r\n```\r\nValueError: Key chinese_tokenizer not supported, available options: dict_keys(['characters', 'space', 'space_punct', 'underscore', 'comma', 'untokenized' (...) 'bert'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the use case**\r\nBy allowing using custom languages for spacy, users using other language would be able to process their texts quicker and easier.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHere's the current solution...\r\n```yaml\r\ninput_features:\r\n  -\r\n    name: input\r\n    type: text\r\n    preprocessing:\r\n      word_tokenizer: english_tokenize\r\n```\r\n...which I think could be changed to this...\r\n```yaml\r\ninput_features:\r\n  -\r\n    name: input\r\n    type: text\r\n    preprocessing:\r\n      word_tokenizer: spacy_tokenize\r\n      spacy_model: zh #(or en, xx, etc.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've considered not to use spacy but to use a custom script to simply split sentences to words using some processors like \"jieba\". However, by using this method I would lose nearly all benefits from NLP.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI think that's all :)\r\nI don't know whether my advice could be accepted. But if it got solved I would be very thankful. \r\nBTW since I'm not a native English speaker, there may be some mistakes.
