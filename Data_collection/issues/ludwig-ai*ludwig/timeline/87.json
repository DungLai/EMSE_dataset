This is I what I'm doing in [fasttext.js](https://github.com/loretoparisi/fasttext.js), where I wrap fastText binary into a node.js library: The model is loaded once through the `ludwig predict --model_path /path/to/model - `. This because the `predict` (with that option) will call `LudwigModel.load`, and  open the `stdin` and waits for line feed. Then I send to the forked process the text writing to the `stdin` (hence like `stdin.write(call me at +3912345679 for offers\\r\\n)`).\r\nIn this way `ludwig predict` would be used in several ways: REST servers with a process fork, attached to bash process, etc.\r\nIn my experience of FastText, the execution overhead is minimal (process fork and pipe to `stdin`) and it's faster than running programmatically, without losing the functionality. Since `ludwig` has a great command line, it would be a useful addon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463928556/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"loretoparisi","id":163333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi","html_url":"https://github.com/loretoparisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2141664972,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE0MTY2NDk3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2141664972","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T06:51:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2141664974,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNDE2NjQ5NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2141664974","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T06:51:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/463932758","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/87#issuecomment-463932758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/87","id":463932758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzkzMjc1OA==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T07:12:01Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T07:12:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Got it, that seems like a great idea.

Plus more than one sample may be passed at the same time, which means that probably you want to encode it in something like JSON: `stdin.write({\"text\": [\"call me at +3912345679 for offers\", \"text_2\"], \"other_feature\": [other_value_1, other_value_2]})`.\r\nI think that would work, what do you think?

adding my 2 cents here. For our cluster installation of python server we run Tornado. It let you to leverage multi-threaded applications or gunicord the WSGI approach. I actually prefer Tornado because typically using a singleton mixin pattern, so that all the models (like TF / PyTorch graphs) are backed in memory once and shared across threads and all instances at every api call. Of course from the framework perspective, there is some middleware component to fill the gap between the framework and the front-end at runtime in order to serve byte streams.\r\nAbout this, once approach, that was provided by Stanford CoreNLP was the consider every task as a whole pipeline, so that all resources are statically loaded at startup of the CoreNLP modules, so you have all NLP annotators loading resources (from datasets to models to configurations) once, and if you add new annotators later on at run-time, they will share a singleton instance (That is actually a static class), that handles all the

Code Pull Requests\r\nThis code adds an inference server to models trained by ludwig. https://github.com/uber/ludwig/issues/87\r\n`ludwig serve --model_path path/to/model --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0`\r\n` curl http://localhost:8000/predict -X POST -d \"[{\\\"text\\\": \\\"test\\\"}]\"`\r\nI went with Starlette over something like Flask because it has a more modern API that supports async await which will come in handy for file uploads later. \r\nStill haven't implemented image inference. Want to get some feedback on the approach before moving forward with that. \r\nCould either do multipart form uploads or base64 encoding in the request body. I imagine the latter would be more costly but form uploads are generally a worse API for inference on tabular data and NLP. \r\n\r\n# Documentation Pull Requests\r\nWill do after settling on an approach.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that the documentation HTML files are in `docs/` while the Markdown sources are in `mkdocs/docs`.\r\n\r\nIf you are proposing a modification to the documentation you should change only the Markdown files, then recreate the documentation as explained in the `mkdocs/README.md` file with `mkdocs build`, which will create the HTML files automatically, and only after this create a commit.\r\n\r\n`api.md` is automatically generated from the docstrings in the code, so if you want to change something in that file, first modify `ludwig/api.py` docstring, then run `mkdocs/code_docs_autogen.py`, which will create `mkdocs/docs/api.md` and then finally run `mkdocs build` which will generate the HTML in `docs/`.\r\n-=>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3045482680,"node_id":"MDE5OkFkZGVkVG9Qcm9qZWN0RXZlbnQzMDQ1NDgyNjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3045482680","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-18T02:34:21Z","project_card":{"id":33260674,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/33260674","project_id":3973922,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/3973922","column_name":"Feature Requests"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
