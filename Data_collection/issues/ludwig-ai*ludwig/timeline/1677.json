We changed that codepath and mow each loss is summed up independently and lambda is only for l1/l2 regularization. Before the default reg was set to None and turnng on lambda in tabnet meant turning on only the tabnet loss. Now the tabnet loss is not dependent on lambda (as it should be) and the default reg il l2, so setting lambda to 0 achieves the same loss calculation as before.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1014791663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5906159241,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5B0FZazwAAAAFgCNaJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5906159241","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-17T18:13:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5906159244,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5B0FZazwAAAAFgCNaM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5906159244","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-17T18:13:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5906662599,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5B0FZazwAAAAFgEITH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/5906662599","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-17T20:30:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
