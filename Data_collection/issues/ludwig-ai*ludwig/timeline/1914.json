Right now we have a lot of extras in Ludwig, but we don't have adequate test coverage to know if those extra dependencies always life off the critical import path. One solution to this problem would be to add a run of the unit tests that installs Ludwig with minimal dependencies and a limited set of end-to-end tests to make sure everything works.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think text, image, and ray are all very core features a lot of people use and are deeply ingrained in the code, so making them extras puts a lot of additional work on our side to isolate them from the critical path. It may not be worth the effort if 90% of users are using them anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1098449672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6430748629,"node_id":"LE_lADOCbx2hs5HvpgezwAAAAF_TW_V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6430748629","actor":{"login":"dantreiman","id":687280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzI4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/687280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman","html_url":"https://github.com/dantreiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dantreiman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-13T22:35:34Z","label":{"name":"productivity

PR adapts many of the image preprocessing functions in `image_utils.py` (namely, `crop`, `pad`, `crop_or_pad`, and `resize_image`) in order to make them torchscript-compatible. Namely, it (1) removes their dependency on Numpy, (2) enforces stricter typing throughout, and (3) brings constants into local scope in the case of `resize_image`.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR assumes `torchvision` is a part of the minimal Ludwig installation because `try` blocks and `import` statements are not permitted in torchscript code. Concretely, I've removed the `torchvision` checks in `resize_image` and `grayscale`– however, those checks are not currently doing anything in any case because `import torchvision.transforms.functional as F` is currently already located at the top of the file. **That said, we still probably should NOT merge this in until we reach a resolution for #1914.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1101864544","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1914#issuecomment-1101864544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1914","id":1101864544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5BrR5g","user":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-18T23:56:36Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T23:56:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fixed by #1939.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1101864544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6451017530,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5HvpgezwAAAAGAgrc6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6451017530","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-18T23:56:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
