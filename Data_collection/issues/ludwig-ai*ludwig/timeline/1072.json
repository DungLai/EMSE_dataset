you very much for the insightful comment. Yes, I agree, plethora of opportunities with this feature. :)\r\n\r\nRe using set of tensors or vectors: Yes, that's what I could think of as it is very much possible due to the modularity of the code (Special thanks :)). It would also be generalised and not restricted to specific 3D file formats and other unstructured data (maybe for using graphs as input in future...)\r\n\r\nFor beginning, I am exploring to add a new feature registry [here](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/tree/master/ludwig/features) taking examples from the exisiting [image_feature.py](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/features/image_feature.py) as mentioned in the developer docs and also as mentioned in the last comment. I really found it convenient and super easy to provide path to file as input while working on the Visual QA example with images and to have something similar for the pointsets would be amazing.
