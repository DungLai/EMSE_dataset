  re: `.evaluate`.  This function evaluates predictions derived from a trained model and reports the performance metrics.  Since `.evaluate()` does not do training there is no per epoch `loss` value returned by the `.evaluate()` function.  Hence there is no data for the `learning_curves()` function to display.\r\n\r\nThe `training_stats` dictionary returned by `.train()` has a different structure than the `eval_stats` dictionary returned in the tuple from `.evaluate()`. \r\n\r\nPlease review the description of the return values for [`.train()`](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/#train) and [`.evaluate()`](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/#evaluate) and note the differences in the description of the contents of the respective \"statistics\" dictionary

I thought `.evaluate` would be the simplest way to get the stats after loading the model from a file instead of re-training (or trying to load the training stats from a JSON file). I did notice that the evaluate stats were missing the epoch data it wasn't clear which other visualizations would work with both training and evaluate stats.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the thorough examples!
