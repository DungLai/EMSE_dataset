Putting the eval step in ECD is really just. matter of convenience, as it runs a forward pass and updates metrics on the model. But I think the more principled thing to do is move it out of ECD.

other?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1369107377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8138502715,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5aXKhBzwAAAAHlF7I7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/8138502715","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-02T17:22:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8138502719,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5aXKhBzwAAAAHlF7I_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/8138502719","actor":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-02T17:22:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1369366861","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2895#issuecomment-1369366861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2895","id":1369366861,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5RnuFN","user":{"login":"ericxsun","id":1772912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1772912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun","html_url":"https://github.com/ericxsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericxsun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-03T03:48:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T03:53:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tgaddair
