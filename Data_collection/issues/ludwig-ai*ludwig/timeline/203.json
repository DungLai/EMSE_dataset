I believe there are two different issues going on here.\r\n\r\nOne is: how to deal with data provided per timestamp, which I guess is kind of the standard for timeseries data (I'm not expert in timeseries). At the moment ludwig requires you to provide the whole timeseries, with different features, as a row. For instance you example would look like:\r\n```\r\nms_close,                                 2ms_close,                              3ms_close, ...\r\n299.9991 299.9992 299.9995, 299.9991 299.9991 299.9992, 299.9991 299.9991 299,9991, ...\r\n```\r\nWith the assumptions that you have several timeseries you are learning from, not only one. But i would be curious to hear your thoughts about it as, again, I'm no timeseries expert.\r\n\r\nThe second is: how do you feed data (independently of the shape) from streams. The is not simple way to do that in Ludwig at the moment, I have to figure out well the usecase, in particular if it is for training, for prediction or for both.\r\nIn the meantime, one thing I may suggest is to use the programmatic API, as the `LudwigModel` class provides both an `online_train` method that trains on a specific batch that you provide, and also a `predict` that predicts on the specific data you provide (which can come from a queue from a stream or whatever else). What goes around it (reading the stream, modifying the data and providing it to Ludwig) will have to be implemented by you, but at least you have a way to do that.\r\n\r\nI'mm mark this as enhancement, but some deeper thought needs to go into this i believe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/472667644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2202044037,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMDIwNDQwMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2202044037","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T01:23:12Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2202044038,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMDIwNDQwMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2202044038","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T01:23:12Z","label":{"name":"help
