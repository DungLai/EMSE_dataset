filed parameter is the name of the column / output feature you want to visualize. In your case it would be `field = \"RainTomorrow\"`.\r\n\r\nFor the learning curves:\r\nI don't know how you obtained train_stats. If you got it from the API `model.train()` you can use it as it is, otherwise you just have to load the `training_statistics.json` file that was saved at the end of training. After you do that `learning_curves(train_stats, field, output_directory=output_dir, file_format='png')` should work.\r\n\r\nFor the confusion matrix:\r\njust use the field parameter as i specified and your command should work.\r\n\r\nWill update the docs to try to explain better what is `field`.
