If you are using the `ludwig predict` command, there will be files containing the probabilities in the results directory. If you are using the API call `LudwigModel.predict()` you'll either get probabilities as additional columns in your pandas dataframe of if you choose to return a dictionary you'll get something like `return_dict[feature_name]['probabilties']`.\r\nDetails about the predict function are available in the [user guide predict section](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#predict), while details about the API predict function are available in the [API
