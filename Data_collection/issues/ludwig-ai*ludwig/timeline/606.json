answer is simple: Tensorflow allocates memory on all the GPUs it can find (the ones you specify), but that doesn't mean it uses them. It depends on the architecture of the model, like some layers may live on one GPU and some layers may live on another GPU. In Ludwig all the model lives on one GPU. In order to be able to leverage multiple GPUs fr training you need to set up a multi-gpu distributed training with Horovod.
