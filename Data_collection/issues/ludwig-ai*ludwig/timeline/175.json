meant `model.close()`. It depends how are you using Ludwig, if from the command line or from the APIs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I figured it out.\r\nFirst thing: by default Ludwig trims and pads sequences to 256, which is a lot for some applications. You may want to set the `sequence_length_limit` in both input and output features to be the actual maximum length in words that you want, which probably is shorter than 256.\r\nSecond thing: because the vocabulary is big, the final softmax is also big `[batch_size x sequence_length x 20000]` so you can either decrease the number of words that you consider with the `most_common` preprocessing parameter, or you have to reduce the batch size a lot.\r\nFinally, another way to deal with this problem is to use an approximation to the softmax instead of the full softmax. So you can use a loss that is `sampled_softmax_cross_entropy`.\r\n\r\nThe combination of this things made it work and fit in memory for me with the following model definition:\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: user1\r\n        type: sequence\r\n        encoder: rnn\r\n        cell_type: lstm\r\n\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: user2\r\n        type: sequence\r\n        decoder: generator\r\n        cell_type: lstm\r\n        loss:\r\n            type: sampled_softmax_cross_entropy\r\n\r\ntraining:\r\n    batch_size: 96\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I fixed a little bug along the way, so you may want to use the code from master instead of the pip installed package (will release v0.1.1 soon with this and other bugfixes).\r\nFinally, because of punctuation, you may want to use `text` instead of `sequence` as a datatype as the preprocessing is performed taking punctuation and other things into account in the case of text.\r\n\r\nThis actually made me think about the need for a different parameter: eval_batch_size as in this case you could increase the training batch size a lot because of the sampled softmax, but the eval one still needs to be small because the full softmax is computed. So this additional parameter is also coming soon.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this solves your issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/470352165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/470357509","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/175#issuecomment-470357509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/175","id":470357509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDM1NzUwOQ==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T02:23:05Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T02:23:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I
