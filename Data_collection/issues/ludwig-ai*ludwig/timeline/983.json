It's interesting and worth investigating. Do you have a reference for this that we can study? In the links you added it looks like `waveform_to_log_mel_spectrogram_patches` is the function we would need to replicate for this, but I'd like to look at some papers / systems that do this to use as a reference if you happen to know them.
