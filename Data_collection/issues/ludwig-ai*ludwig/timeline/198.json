@w4nderlust, @EdwardFKit I have now started working on this, I will keep you updated.\r\n\r\n@sk1210 that sound great, thank you for being willing to help, that is hreatly appreciated.\r\nAssing GANs to Ludwig is non trivial at the moment because of its architectures. Some of the changes we are making for v0.3 will definitely make it easier.\r\nBecause it's non trivial I suggest you to fisrt study in detail the codebase, the best way being training a model by going through it with a debugger, line by line.\r\nAfter you have done that, you can come un with a design proposal and we can discuss together about it. For it to be something I woyld want to include in the codebase, it will need to be a generic solution. So I encourage you to get in touch before steaming ahead and implementing things to avoid the risk you'll come up with a solution I would not want to include.\r\nDoes this make sense to you?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/619231907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3270981052,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3MDk4MTA1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3270981052","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-24T20:47:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3270981054,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzA5ODEwNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3270981054","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-24T20:47:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3270981059,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3MDk4MTA1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3270981059","actor":{"login":"sk1210","id":18681442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgxNDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18681442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210","html_url":"https://github.com/sk1210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sk1210/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-24T20:47:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
