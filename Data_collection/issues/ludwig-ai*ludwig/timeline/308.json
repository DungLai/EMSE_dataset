As Ludwig automaitcally detects if the HDF5 and JSON file are present in the same directory of the CSV file, their location needs to be fixed.\r\nAt the same time, ludwig saves a bunch of things in the output directory, including a model directory with weights, hyperparameters and also another copy of the metadata JSON file (`output_directory/model/train_set_metadata.json`) as it is needed by a model when it is loaded. So you can you that metadata file instead is you don't want to save it alongside the CSV data.\r\nLet me know if this solves your
