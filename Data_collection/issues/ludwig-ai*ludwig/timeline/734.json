In the mean time you can try using \"sampled_softmax_cross_entropy\" as loss where it should also make a difference.\r\n2) the improvement is calculated on a \"combined\" output feature by default. The loss of \"combined\" is the sum of the losses of the individual output features plus regularization. Becuase I believe you have only one class what i suspect is happening is that you also added regularization or other parts of the loss that make the value of the loss of \"combined\" different from the value of the loss of your output feature. I can't be sure without doublechecking with a reproducible example thoug. One thing you can do to check for this hypothesys is to set the training validation_field to \"tags\" (which I believe is the name of your output feature) and there should be no misalignment. i see how this could be confusing as it is probably not clearly explained in the docs, I will think about revising the description accordingly and also probably print the value of combined (it is printed when there's more than one feature and hidden when there's only one at the moment, but if you look at the output training statistics you'll find it there).\r\n3) If you can reproduce the issue with synthetic data that would be of great help for me to go and fix the probem if there is one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/643545527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3440304842,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0NDAzMDQ4NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3440304842","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-13T01:01:02Z","label":{"name":"waiting for answer","color":"fff36b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/644700048","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/734#issuecomment-644700048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/734","id":644700048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDcwMDA0OA==","user":{"login":"jmizgajski","id":3886340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODYzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3886340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski","html_url":"https://github.com/jmizgajski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmizgajski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T11:16:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T11:16:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did add regularization in my settings so this may be the case.
