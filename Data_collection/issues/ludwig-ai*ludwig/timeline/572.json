Shouldn't this information already exist in the model I'm loading?\r\n\r\nThe reason is that ludwig has to re-build the model graph for loading its weights, and it does it from the model definition. If you use `--model_load_path' the model definition could be slightly different from the ones you are loading (for instance you use the same model, but a different last layer to obtain a different classsification). To allow for those cases in the future, we made it so that you also have to specify the model definition. In your case the model definition is anyway present in the same directory you saved the model in, so it should be easy to locate and use it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/555276408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
