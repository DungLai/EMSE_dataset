ABORATOR","body":"@carlogrisetti and @tgaddair you can actuall yspecify it at a global level, but still on a per feature type basis:\r\n```\r\npreprocessing:\r\n  force_split: false\r\n  image:\r\n    in_memory: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `force_split` is a global preprocessing parameter while `in_memory` is image specific. (so Travis' suggestions of putting `in_memory` in the feature preprocessing is correct, but `force_split` should not be placed there, it will have no effect)\r\n\r\nThe logic is: there are default preprocessing parameters, both global (force_split, split_probablities, etc.) and type specific (image.in_memory, sequence._max_sequence_length etc.). If you specify your custom ones in the preprocessing section, they override them (both global and per type), meaning that if you replace image.in_memory to be False, all image features will behave that way. The local preprocessing you specify for the specific feature will affect only that feature and not the others of the same type. So if you have 3 image inputs for instance, you can set preprocessing.image.in_memory: False to make all 3 read from disk, and if you change the preprocessing of one of them to in_memory True, only that specific one would be loaded in memory.\r\nHope this clarifies, probably should make it more clear in the docs too.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: @carlogrisetti  can you try with the specified global/type preprocessing I pasted and confirm everything works fine and that we can close?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/722747807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3965092347,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk2NTA5MjM0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3965092347","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T01:26:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3965092351,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NjUwOTIzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3965092351","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T01:26:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
