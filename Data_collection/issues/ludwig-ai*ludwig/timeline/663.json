It's indeed pretty weird, I would have expected slightly different results (do to appeoximation / randomization) but these diefferences are substantial.\r\nI will definitely look into it. Would it be possible for you to share an entirely replicable setting, with data, script / command and yaml file?\r\nIf not, would it be possible to try to replicate using the dataset synthesizer in `data/dataset_synthesizer.py`?\r\nAlso it could be a feature type dependent issue, so even if you can't provide data and are unable to replicate, at least knowing your yaml configuration would still be useful.\r\n\r\nFinally, just for confirming the issue, could you please try using

@w4nderlust looks like you were right.\r\n\r\nRunning the model with just 'lstm' as the cell type fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nSame datasets with GPU (without cudnn)\r\n\r\n0.962\r\n0.988\r\n0.949\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly the same as the original CPU runs.\r\n\r\nIt has also solved what I thought was a second problem which was that for some dataset (not the three above) some folders were getting an accuracy of 0. I thought this might be a class imbalance issues but it is no longer happening.\r\n\r\nIn Google Colab the default install of Tensorflow is 1.5.0 which I left based on Google's recommendation in their documentation rather than 1.5.2 which you suggested.\r\n\r\nI also haven't run the trial again with the CPU install but I can if you think it will be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help with this issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, the data sythensizer is excellent!
