I see that you report the total dataset size (train + val + test), but wouldn't it be actually correct to only report the train dataset size since that's what's being used to compute the number of epochs based on batch size?\r\n\r\nFor e.g., I ran the 100MB dataset with and without hyperopt with the following config:\r\n\r\n- 100MB dataset has ~ 354K rows in the train set\r\n- Batch size: 32K\r\n- Window size: 16K\r\n- Expected steps per epoch: 354K / 32K ~ 11\r\n- The output says the same thing: 11 steps per epoch, training for 1100 steps, approximately 100 epochs = 11 * 32K = ~ 354K\r\n\r\nI feel like this functionality is working correctly, but maybe I'm still missing the crux of the

up on [this issue](https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2144), when using windowing in the backend over a partitioned dataset (> 1 partition), we observed that the `steps_per_epoch` was being under-calculated. This results in each epoch only comprising of a fraction of the dataset.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `RayDatasetShard` class to use size of the `RayDataset` to calculate the number of epochs instead of the size of the `DatasetPipeline` to calculate the number of epochs, bringing back the number of epochs to what we'd expect.\r\n\r\n**Validation that this change works**:\r\n- Dataset size (100MB) ~ 354000 rows in the training data\r\n- Partitioning the dataset into 10 blocks\r\n- Setting the loader's window size to 2048 bytes\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n- Calling `train_cli()` with the dataset resulted in:\r\n    - 10 windows being created\r\n    - Just two steps per epoch, and with a batch size of ~32K, that meant we would only train over 64K rows per epoch\r\n\r\n**Now**\r\n- Calling `train_cli()` with the dataset results in\r\n    - 10 windows being created\r\n    - 11 steps per epoch, and with a batch size of ~32K, that means ~354K rows per epoch which is correct\r\n\r\n``` \r\n2022-06-21 19:36:36,768 INFO dataset.py:2643 -- Created DatasetPipeline with 10 windows: 1.75MiB min, 1.78MiB max, 1.77MiB mean\r\n2022-06-21 19:36:36,802 INFO dataset.py:2643 -- Created DatasetPipeline with 10 windows: 0.52MiB min, 0.54MiB max, 0.53MiB mean\r\n2022-06-21 19:36:36,834 INFO dataset.py:2643 -- Created DatasetPipeline with 10 windows: 0.27MiB min, 0.29MiB max, 0.28MiB mean\r\n``` \r\n\r\n```\r\n100 [00:00<?, ?it/s](BaseWorkerMixin pid=13772) Note: steps_per_checkpoint (was 2000) is now set to the number of steps per epoch: 11.\r\n(BaseWorkerMixin pid=13772) \r\n(BaseWorkerMixin pid=13772) Training for 1100 step(s), approximately 100 epoch(s).\r\n(BaseWorkerMixin pid=13772) Early stopping policy: 10 round(s) of evaluation, or 110 step(s), approximately 10 epoch(s).\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6850620865,"node_id":"AE_lADOCbx2hs5LyKUtzwAAAAGYVC3B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6850620865","actor":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-21T20:01:24Z","assignee":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6971504646,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5LyKUtzwAAAAGfiLgG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6971504646","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-11T17:38:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
