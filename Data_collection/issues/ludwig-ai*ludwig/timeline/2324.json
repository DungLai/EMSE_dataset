PR addresses two separate issues: https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2324 and https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2308.\r\n\r\nThe issues are addressed by culling empty partitions from the Dask DataFrame at two points: (1) after dropping rows with NaNs (part of the DROP_ROWS missing value strategy) and (2) after splitting the dataset into train/val/test.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain/increase performance, we add a persist call at the end of `build_dataset`, which makes it relatively inexpensive to compute the length of partitions repeatedly downstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
