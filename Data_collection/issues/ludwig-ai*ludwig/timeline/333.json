So it looks like some of your images only have 1 channel (greyscale) while others have 3 channels. This is expected behavior. There are two solutions here:\r\n1. Set num_channels: 3 in the preprocessing section. Ludwig will append channels with zeros for the images that have <3 channels. \r\n2. Fix the number of channels for all your images in the training data.
