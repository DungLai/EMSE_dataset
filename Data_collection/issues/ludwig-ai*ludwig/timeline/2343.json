@Jeffwan, great question!\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward way to get hyperopt trial status would be the `experiment_state-<datetime>.json` file that is created inside the results logdir. This file contains a list of checkpoints, where each checkpoint is a dictionary that contains information about a trial. You can take a look at the `status` key for each dictionary, and the checkpoints list overall, to query the status of the hyperopt experiment. Would that be sufficient for unblocking your use case?\r\n\r\nAnother way to do this programatically would be using [Ray Tune Callbacks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/internals.html#ray.tune.callback.Callback), where we update the trial status each time the callback is used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1239014674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ShreyaR","id":5787923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODc5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5787923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyaR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7336208852,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5PD648zwAAAAG1RanU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7336208852","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T07:29:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7336208860,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5PD648zwAAAAG1Ranc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7336208860","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T07:29:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7345367362,"node_id":"LE_lADOCbx2hs5PD648zwAAAAG10WlC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7345367362","actor":{"login":"ShreyaR","id":5787923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODc5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5787923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShreyaR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShreyaR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-08T08:28:30Z","label":{"name":"waiting
