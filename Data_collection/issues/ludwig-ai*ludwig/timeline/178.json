All the functionality for image classification examples is for running ludwig locally on your laptop.

there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/470265318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ydudin3-zz","id":33033675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDMzNjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33033675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/ydudin3-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2185323929,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE4NTMyMzkyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2185323929","actor":{"login":"AnthonyBozzo","id":17656806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjU2ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17656806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyBozzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-06T20:33:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2185323930,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxODUzMjM5MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2185323930","actor":{"login":"AnthonyBozzo","id":17656806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjU2ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17656806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyBozzo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyBozzo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-06T20:33:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2185324592,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxODUzMjQ1OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2185324592","actor":{"login":"ydudin3-zz","id":33033675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDMzNjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33033675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/ydudin3-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydudin3-zz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-06T20:33:27Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/4
