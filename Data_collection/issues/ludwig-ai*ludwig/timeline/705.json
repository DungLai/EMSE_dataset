\r\nHey,\r\nI tried a bit if I find a way to predict on the model. Now I can predict on a BERT model I trained, but it's working olny on CPU. So I trained on GPU because on CPU it will last weeks :) and after that i use a predict/test command or python file on CPU to predict on that model. Even the prediction last a few hours  on CPU for the amount of data I tried it with.\r\nBut I still don't get why the training is working on GPU but the predict/test not. Normally it can't be more computational effort as the training or am I thinking wrong? As well because within the training there is a test.\r\nDo you have any suggestions/assumptions for me or did you find something wrong in the data I
