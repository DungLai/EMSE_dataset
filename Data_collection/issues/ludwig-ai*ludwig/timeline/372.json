Install the most recent version of ludwig with `pip uninstall ludwig` and `pip install git+http://github.com/uber/ludwig.git` and use the predict function, it should work fine.\r\n\r\nA little more explanation for posterity: before the predict function had a `--only_predictions` parameter that allowed to do what you are looking for, then the logic changed and the parameters was `--preform_test` but most users where still confused, so we decided to split in two functions, `predict` that doesn't require any output column and only predicts, and `test` that requires the output column and also computes measures of the quality of the prediction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/500170720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2399176708,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5OTE3NjcwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2399176708","actor":{"login":"zackthefair","id":51504688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTA0Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51504688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair","html_url":"https://github.com/zackthefair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:39:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2399176709,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTkxNzY3MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2399176709","actor":{"login":"zackthefair","id":51504688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTA0Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51504688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair","html_url":"https://github.com/zackthefair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackthefair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:39:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/500170763","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/372#issuecomment-500170763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/372","id":500170763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDE3MDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:40:40Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T22:40:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":

you for your reply, @w4nderlust \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the problem persists. I'm aware of the predict and test commands. Even though I've mentioned the --only_predictions parameter, I'm using Ludwig's most recent version (or at least I think I am) on Colab, so I just use !git clone https://github.com/uber/ludwig.git > !pip install -r requirements.txt > !python setup.py install.\r\n\r\nI'll try to be clear.\r\n\r\nmy yaml file is:\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: Pclass\r\n        type: category\r\n    -\r\n        name: Sex\r\n        type: category\r\n    -\r\n        name: Age\r\n        type: numerical\r\n        preprocessing:\r\n          missing_value_strategy: fill_with_mean\r\n    -\r\n        name: SibSp\r\n        type: numerical\r\n    -\r\n        name: Parch\r\n        type: numerical\r\n    -\r\n        name: Fare\r\n        type: numerical\r\n\r\n    -\r\n        name: Embarked\r\n        type: category\r\n\r\n\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -\r\n        name: Survived\r\n        type: binary\r\n```\r\nFirstly, I train train.csv file, which contain target column \"Survived\". Then, considering the model I trained, I want to predict for survivors over the test.csv file, which doen NOT contain \"Survived\" column. Like mentioned before, the error appears after I use the predict command. After I type\r\n```\r\n!ludwig train --data_csv train.csv --model_definition_file modelo.yaml\r\n```\r\nand then\r\n```\r\n!ludwig predict --data_csv test.csv --model_path results/experiment_run_0/model/\r\n```\r\nTerminal gives me: \r\n```\r\nWARNING: The TensorFlow contrib module will not be included in TensorFlow 2.0.\r\nFor more information, please see:\r\n  * https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180907-contrib-sunset.md\r\n  * https://github.com/tensorflow/addons\r\nIf you depend on functionality not listed there, please file an issue.\r\n\r\n███████████████████████\r\n█ █ █ █  ▜█ █ █ █ █   █\r\n█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ ███\r\n█ █   █ █ █ █ █ █ █ ▌ █\r\n█ █████ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █\r\n█     █  ▟█     █ █   █\r\n███████████████████████\r\nludwig v0.1.2 - Predict\r\n\r\nDataset path: test.csv\r\nModel path: results/experiment_run_0/model/\r\nOutput path: results_0\r\n\r\nLoading metadata from: results/experiment_run_0/model/train_set_metadata.json\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/ludwig-0.1.2-py3.6.egg/ludwig/features/numerical_feature.py:66: FutureWarning: Method .as_matrix will be removed in a future version.
