thank you for your interest in working on this!\r\nSo the first step for this I believe would be to create a new type of feature, something like BoundingBoxSet or Bounding Boxes. There is an open PR for a single bounding box, you can take inspiration from that i believe: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/pull/344\r\nOnce that is tested to work, What I would do is to take a model, like Faster-RCNN for instance, split it into an encoding part and a decoding part, the decoding part goes becomes one of the optional decoders of the BoundingBoxSet output feature, while the encoding part goes into a new encoder for the Image input feature.\r\nI can help you out with this, I'm going to be traveling next week to present at conferences, but when I'm back I can take a stab at how to split the model into encoder and decoder so that it would be easier for you. How does this
