If you look at the output of the command, it explains to you what is wrong, namely you did not specify a model definition. You also did not specify the data you want to train on. I suggest you to read the [Getting Started](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/getting_started/) guide and later on the [User Guide](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/). Also `ludwig experiment --help` explains the parameters available to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/541153631/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2707328437,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3MDczMjg0Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2707328437","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-11T20:22:08Z","label":{"name":"waiting for answer","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/541309142","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/534#issuecomment-541309142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/534","id":541309142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTMwOTE0Mg==","user":{"login":"AlexeyGy","id":13885630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg1NjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13885630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexeyGy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyGy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T10:00:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T10:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To improve user experience with the CLI, I suggest hiding the TensorFlow warning level messages by default.
