Use the image to create a Ray cluster through KubeRay and get connection string `10.227.151.166:32471`\r\n3. Start a new ludwig container (can access above address) and run the program.\r\n```\r\nexport RAY_ADDRESS=ray://10.227.151.166:32471\r\npython3 script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe should not see the type error. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: \\[e.g. iOS\\]\r\n- Version \\[e.g. 22\\]\r\n- Python version 3.8\r\n- Ludwig version 0.5.2\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1198597839","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2326#issuecomment-1198597839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2326","id":1198597839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5HcSbP","user":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T20:26:20Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T20:26:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This was fixed in #2286.
