for your response, I'll try to clarify what's happening:\r\n\r\nThe `LudwigModel.train` method accepts four parameters that allow to skip saving of files. These are\r\n```\r\nskip_save_mode\r\nskip_save_progress\r\nskip_save_log\r\nskip_save_processed_input\r\n```\r\nI've set all of these to `True`, but the `results` directory is still being created. The parameter that sets the name of this directory is `output_directory`. I've tried setting this parameter to an empty string or to `None`, but both of these values lead to exceptions. There seems to be no way to avoid the creation of this directory.\r\n\r\nRegarding `LuwdigModel.predict`, please take a look at my other issue https://github.com/uber/ludwig/issues/492. The `skip_save_unprocessed_output` parameter, which is available for the command line prediction script, is simply not exposed in the python API, so that the `*.npy` files are always being created and there is no way to turn that off.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/521164153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BeWe11","id":14355528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzU1NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14355528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11","html_url":"https://github.com/BeWe11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeWe11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/522766285","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/491#issuecomment-522766285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/491","id":522766285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjc2NjI4NQ==","user":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T21:45:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T21:45:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@w4nderlust
