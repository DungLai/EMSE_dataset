  Here is my perspective of where we can improve the unit tests:\r\n* With the exception of some recent tests, most of the tests, when writing out results, use the same output directory name.  This is not necessarily an issue except if we try to run tests in parallel.  For these tests, we'd like to put the output in a temporary directory.  This way it will avoid conflicts.\r\n* Many tests run multiple scenarios, i.e., combination of parameters.  These multiple scenarios are hard coded in the the actual test itself.  Where possible, we'd like to externalize the combination of parameters with the @pytest.mark.parameterize decorator.\r\n* Right now the entire suite takes about 30 minutes to run.  It would be great if we can reduce the time.  Some thoughts on reducing the time:\r\n  * Some tests, which is focused on results of training, often train their own model when they could share a single trained model to test the results, thus saving the time for training over and over.\r\n  * A few tests take a shotgun approach to testing different scenarios.  I'm thinking if we can take a more surgical approach we can offer the same coverage with less effort.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this provides you a view of where we can improve the tests.  Let me think about how I can provide you details on the above.  I'll be back in touch in a day or two.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any thoughts on unit tests, I'm open for
