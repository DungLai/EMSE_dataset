That's why on one hand there's the Ludwig serve command, and on the other hand we support neuropod and will support torchscript exports. The torchscript (which includes compiled version of preprocessing and postprocessing inside the torchscript output) will initially work only for simple data types and later will include also more complex ones, and will likely be the highest throughput solution that requires the smallest fottprint on disk and memory. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I think there could be several optimziations to bring down the

@fire! I worked on some of the torchscript stuff so can help out here a bit.\r\n\r\nNext step is probably checking that the exported model works as expected. You can verify this by making a Python dict of inputs, where each key is the CSV column name used for model training and each value is the corresponding inputs.\r\n\r\nI took a look at your repository link– for text features, the model will expect a list of strings of length `batch_size`. For numerical features, the model will expect a tensor.\r\n\r\nOnce you have this, pass it in to the model and inspect the outputs. Let me know how this goes– super happy to answer any questions you have along the way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1140078764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"geoffreyangus","id":29719151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29719151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus","html_url":"https://github.com/geoffreyangus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyangus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6695712487,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5GBkrtzwAAAAGPGHbn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6695712487","actor":{"login":"fire","id":32321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire","html_url":"https://github.com/fire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-27T22:25:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6695712492,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5GBkrtzwAAAAGPGHbs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6695712492","actor":{"login":"fire","id":32321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire","html_url":"https://github.com/fire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-27T22:25:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1164085919","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1831#issuecomment-1164085919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1831","id":1164085919,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5FYoqf","user":{"login":"fire","id":32321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire","html_url":"https://github.com/fire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-23T08:02:32Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T08:06:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@geoffreyangus
