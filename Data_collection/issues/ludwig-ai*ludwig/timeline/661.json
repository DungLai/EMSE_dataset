\r\n\r\nThank you for the answer.\r\n\r\nYour right, due to my company policy I couldn't share data. I will try to send you fastly synthetic data and model to reproduce.\r\n\r\nTo respond to your questions:\r\n\r\nWhen you train a model which have to process text, the text data is provide to ludwig inside a csv file. If one cell of the csv file is empty, the dataframe generate by ludwig return NaN value (equivalent to None) for the empty cells. That's not a problem, it's just the behavior. \r\n\r\nBut, with the REST Api, i don't want to lose time to put my input data vector inside a binary csv which one should be save temporarly by ludwig and process after to construct a dataframe. So, I try to send directly my input data. In that specific case, on the client side, it's seems to be not possible to send empty data (like None), I could only send blank (like \"\"). But, if I display the dataframe build by ludwig, I notice that the only difference between the two methods is  the  NaN/Blank cells.\r\n\r\nSo, my first approach should be to try to find a solution which allow the client to send 1 None field (Field is define with None value) without success ( I spare a very lot's of time on this question without finding a solution ).\r\nMy second approach should be to write another ludwig REST Api input (called predic_json) which received not a files, but a json ( which allow to send None data. ) and this function returned to me exactly the same result like a standard predict with the csv file.\r\n\r\nIn terms of results:\r\nludwig predict with csv:  \r\n{'tag_predictions': 'CLASS_1', 'tag_probability': 0.532364}\r\n\r\nludwig serve with manual input data:  \r\n{'tag_predictions': 'undefined', 'tag_probability': 0.5043553113937378}\r\n\r\nludwig serve with custom json function:  \r\n{'tag_predictions': 'CLASS_1', 'tag_probability': 0.532364}","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/603786150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myzarak","id":2746389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDYzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2746389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak","html_url":"https://github.com/myzarak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myzarak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3163543298,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE2MzU0MzI5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3163543298","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-25T11:22:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3163543300,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNjM1NDMzMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/3163543300","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-25T11:22:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/604176479","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/661#issuecomment-604176479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/661","id":604176479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDE3NjQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T01:31:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T01:31:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks
