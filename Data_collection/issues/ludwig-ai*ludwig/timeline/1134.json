the bug**\r\nThis issue is related with #1134.\r\n\r\nI tried to replace the `reshape_features` with `features` to workaround the bug caused by `IteratableBatcher` (see #1134  for the detailed descriptions about the issue), but when working on the petfinder dataset, the `self.reshapes_features` is empty after applying the following code between L35-L39 of

Please do not merge.\r\n\r\nA bit explanation about the workaround:\r\n- Due to Issue #1134 -- the `self.features` attribute is missing, I appended a `self.features` so it can work with IteratableBatcher without errors.\r\n\r\n- Due to Issue #1135  -- on petfinder dataset, after the dict comprehension we'll get an empty dict which will cause an error when reading data batches. I remove the `if `reshape` in training_set_metadata[feature[NAME]]` and seem to work around the issue.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4522084083,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1MjIwODQwODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4522084083","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-29T15:04:11Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4522084453,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0NTIyMDg0NDUz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4522084453","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-29T15:04:14Z","assignee":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-29T15:06:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T15:06:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1138/c
