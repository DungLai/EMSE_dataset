The way dependencies work is that the final representation before the prediction of a feature is used as an additional input to another feature (the one where you specified the dependency). This means that the value received by finaly feature is not the value of the predicted intermediate feature but the vector used to predict intermediate. In your current configuration, each output has no associated layers, so the vector is, in bot cases, the one coming from the combiner, so adding the dependency is kinda pointless. What you can do is to add some layers to both, which will make sense. For instance, assuming the combiner outputs a 256 sized vector, you can add a fc_layer with size 64 to intermediate, then the input to final will be the 256 vector coming from the combiner and the 64 vector from intermediate, which will be concatenated (if they were of the same size you could have done the sum or the average or the max of the vectors instead). Hopefully this clarifies it :)\r\n3. you could make 2nd intermediate depends on 1st intermediate and final depend on 2nd intermediate (and on 1st intermediate too if you want). They all need to have their fc layers, otherwise it is kinda pointless as I was sayin in 2).\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helped clarify the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/761914942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4215749483,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyMTU3NDk0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/4215749483","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-18T00:51:33Z","label":{"name":"discussion","color":"008500"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jimthompson5802","id":1425269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjUyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802","html_url":"https://github.com/jimthompson5802","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimthompson5802/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-18T03:40:22Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T03:40:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/issues/27","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/issues/27/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/issues/27/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/issues/27/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig-docs/pull/27","id":787888782,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU2NDg2NzA3","number":27,"title":"Fix:
