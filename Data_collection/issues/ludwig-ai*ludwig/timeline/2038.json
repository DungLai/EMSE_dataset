@MarijnQ, looking at your example, it looks like the issue may actually not be related to ray, necessarily. I suspect the model you're trying to load was trained with Ludwig v0.4 and tensorflow, is that right? In Ludwig v0.5, we've updated Ludwig to use PyTorch.\r\n\r\nFor the `experiment` call, it looks like the issue is that the param `--config_file` was changed to `--config`. Can you try changing that param and try again?\r\n\r\nIt is curious that you have Ray installed and yet it is complaining about it not being available. I am not immediately sure why that's happening, but I will see if I can repro that specific issue on our side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1132123414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6645378549,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5Jzr2czwAAAAGMGG31","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6645378549","actor":{"login":"MarijnQ","id":61018583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE4NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61018583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MarijnQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-19T19:35:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6645378558,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5Jzr2czwAAAAGMGG3-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6645378558","actor":{"login":"MarijnQ","id":61018583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE4NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61018583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MarijnQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-19T19:35:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1132568672","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2038#issuecomment-1132568672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2038","id":1132568672,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5DgaBg","user":{"login":"MarijnQ","id":61018583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDE4NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61018583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MarijnQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarijnQ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-20T07:23:02Z","updated_at":"2022-05-20T07:23:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tgaddair Thanks for the fast reply.
