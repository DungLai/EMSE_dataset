stumbled upon an issue with ludwig+mindsdb not working in a situation where ludwig standalone was and it was impossible to figure out what was happening from the error message.\r\n\r\nAfter investigating locally I'm pretty sure that this is due to the fact that we pass a dataframe to ludwig and Suren was passing a file when training standalone, and ludwig runs into some issues with large dataframes.\r\n\r\nTesting locally it seems to handle 5000 rows from said dataframe perfectly file, but crashes at 500,000 rows. Not exactly sure where the limit lies, I think a \"safe\" way of fixing this would be persisting the data used for training ludwig to a csv under the model storage directory and passing that instead of the dataframe.\r\n\r\nOpened a bug report with more details on the ludwig githubL https://github.com/uber/ludwig/issues/593 , but I'd assume it might be harder to fix on their end than on our (if they even care about solving it).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/562335770","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/593#issuecomment-562335770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/593","id":562335770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjMzNTc3MA==","user":{"login":"msaisumanth","id":17418219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17418219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth","html_url":"https://github.com/msaisumanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaisumanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T21:54:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T21:54:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@George3d6 I don't think it's because of size.
