A CSV of 100 samples with 10% NaNs in each column is generated as dataset `D`. \r\n2. A model `M_ray` is instantiated with a Ray backend.\r\n2. `M_ray` is trained on `D`.\r\n3. `M_ray` is evaluated on `D`, creating `metric_ray`.\r\n4. `M_ray` is saved, then reloaded with a Local backend as `M_local`.\r\n5. `M_local` is evaluated on `D`, creating `metric_local`.\r\n6. `metric_ray` is compared with `metric_local`.\r\n\r\nSometimes the test passes and sometimes it fails. I confirmed the following:\r\n\r\n1. The data looks identical between the two backends. This is right before the forward pass.\r\n2. The output probabilities look identical between the two backends. This is a change from what I initially thought– the reason being that I was not considering that batches were being split between two Ray processes.\r\n3. Tests that were passing were processing 90 samples. This is expected because drop_rows should be removing 10% of samples (the ones with NaNs).\r\n3. Tests that were failing were processing 100 samples. This is unexpected for the same reason as above.\r\n\r\n## Inconsistencies in Dask type inference\r\n\r\nIt seems that the issue is related to WHERE exactly the first NaN is located in the binary feature. Such an explanation is supported by the [Dask docs](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.read_csv.html): \r\n\r\n> Dask dataframe tries to infer the dtype of each column by reading a sample from the start of the file (or of the first file if it’s a glob). Usually this works fine, but if the dtype is different later in the file (or in other files) this can cause issues. For example, if all the rows in the sample had integer dtypes, but later on there was a NaN, then this would error at compute time.\r\n\r\nFirst, inspect the dataframe instantiated using `pd.read_csv`. The binary feature is of type `object` because of the presence of NaNs. Note that in this failing test, the first NaN of the binary column appears in the row with index `10`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\npd.read_csv('failing_dataset.csv').head(15)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\r\n      <th></th>\r\n      <th>audio_58299</th>\r\n      <th>binary_EB37B</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>0</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>1</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>2</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>3</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>4</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>5</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>6</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>7</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>8</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>9</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>10</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>NaN</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>11</th>\r\n      <td>NaN</td>\r\n      <td>True</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>12</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>13</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>14</th>\r\n      <td>/var/folders/23/8ddc07cj3knbkldhnfv2cmbr0000gn...</td>\r\n      <td>False</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\npd.read_csv('failing_datasetdataset.csv')['binary_EB37B'].dtype\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    dtype('O')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we read the same dataset using Dask, the NaN at index 10 disappears and is replaced with a `True`.
