@brightsparc , so truncation is set to true because when working with pre-trained encoders, if length of the encoded sequence is greater than the model's maximum admissible input size, this leads to errors in downstream training. With regards to the padding being set to true, sequences in Ludwig are tokenized one at a time and the padding is done internally so the value assigned to padding doesn't really matter.

 Description\r\n\r\nPlease provide the following:\r\n- As per [discussion](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/issues/648#issuecomment-729239220) suggested adding support for the `use_fast` argument passed to the Hugging Face [AutoTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/auto.html#transformers.AutoTokenizer)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n   self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\r\n        pretrained_model_name_or_path, use_fast=True\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidated that I was able to pass the following argument to `create_vocabulary`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from ludwig.utils.strings_utils import create_vocabulary\r\n>>> create_vocabulary('abc',tokenizer_type='hf_tokenizer',\r\npretrained_model_name_or_path='/opt/ml/code/transformer',\r\npretrained_tokenizer_fast=True)\r\n```\r\nI tested with pulling my fork to pip install ludwig, and train a model with the following config.yml\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ninput_features:\r\n    -   name: review_body\r\n        type: text\r\n        level: word\r\n        encoder: bert\r\n        preprocessing:\r\n            pretrained_tokenizer_fast: true\r\n        pretrained_model_name_or_path: /opt/ml/code/transformer\r\noutput_features:\r\n    -   name: star_rating\r\n        type: category\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\nI am not clear on how to update the `docs`.  The update would be to the following page:\r\nhttps://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/user_guide/#text-features-preprocessing\r\n\r\n  * pretrained_tokenizer_fast (default false): if the string has to be lowercased before being handled by the tokenizer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/729393721","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/648#issuecomment-729393721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/648","id":729393721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTM5MzcyMQ==","user":{"login":"brightsparc","id":360368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/360368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc","html_url":"https://github.com/brightsparc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brightsparc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T04:14:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T04:14:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Okay
