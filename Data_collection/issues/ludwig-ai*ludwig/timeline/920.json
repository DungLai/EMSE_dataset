Is ludwig already saving the tf model in SavedModel format?\r\n\r\nYes, Ludwig can export the model as SavedModel, but you need to preprocess the incoming data in the right way and postprocess the model outputs correctly if you want the results to make sense, so uploading only the SavedModel withou pre/post-processing data wouldn't do it.\r\n\r\nOne option is to use the export Neuropod functionality, with also perfroms preprocessing and postprocessing.\r\n\r\nAn additional option is to use the `ludwig serve` command that spawns a Rest API that performs preprocessing, model inference
