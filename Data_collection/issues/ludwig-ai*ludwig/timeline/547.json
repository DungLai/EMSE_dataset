In order to generate the API pages we use a script  in the mkdocs directory. The instructions on how to generate the docs are in the readme in the mkdocs directory too. Please don't touch them, but just modify the docstrings in visualization.py. For a reference about the syntax to follow, look at the syntax of the docstrings in api.py as those are visualized correctly. If you follow exactly the same structure things will look great and achieving this task would be super simple :) Let me know if there's something unclear in the process, I can help you out in case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/546727938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2746855212,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NDY4NTUyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2746855212","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-27T19:55:45Z","label":{"name":"documentation","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2746855213,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NDY4NTUyMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2746855213","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-27T19:55:45Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2746855215,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NDY4NTUyMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2746855215","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-27T19:55:45Z","label":{"name":"waiting

 I understand that I should only modify the docstrings in `ludwig/visualize.py` to correct the formatting errors.  \r\n\r\nInitially, I limited my work only in the docstrings.  After modifying the dcostrings, I ran `mkdocs/code_doc_autogen.py` per instructions in `mkdocs/README.md`.  However, this still did not correctly generate `mkdocs/docs/api/visualization.md`.  \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing `mkdocs/code_doc_autogen.py`, it appears that there was some code missing to process the visualization function specifications.  Working with the current design of `code_doc_autogent.py`, I added about half-dozen lines of code to recognize the specification of the visualization functions.  \r\n\r\nAfter making this change, `mkdocs/docs/api/visualization.md` now reflected the correct formatting for the visualization parameters.\r\n\r\nI'll post a PR with the change so that you can see what changes I made to the
