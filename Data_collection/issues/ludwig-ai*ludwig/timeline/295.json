let me explain the rationale here. `train_online` was initially added as a way to refine a pretrained model. For that reason it assumes there's a model to start from. Your usecase, training from scratch using training online, is definitely a reasonable one. The caveat is the following anyway: Ludwig need the `train_set_metadata` in order to map data from raw values to tensors. So if, for instance you have 10 classes, it contains a mapping from the name of the class to the integer value. Now, if the model is not provided with it, it wouldn't know how to map the inputs and the outputs. Training on a small subset of the data, also may not work, because if the subset doesn't contain all the values, when encountered those values are going to be mapped to `<UNK>`. So what you actually need is a representative sample of your data to train on to begin with. But you are right, one doesn't actually need to train at all, all is needed is a function that, given a representative sample of the data, provides you with the metadata. Such a function is already available in Ludwig, but it's currently not exposed through the APIs: https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/data/preprocessing.py#L105 . So I guess this feature request could be frames as \"expose the preprocessing function to build the metadata\", does it sound good to you?\r\nWill add it to the feature request list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/485560113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2292355196,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI5MjM1NTE5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2292355196","actor":{"login":"George3d6","id":23587658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg3NjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23587658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6","html_url":"https://github.com/George3d6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-22T21:32:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2292355197,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyOTIzNTUxOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2292355197","actor":{"login":"George3d6","id":23587658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg3NjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23587658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6","html_url":"https://github.com/George3d6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/George3d6/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-22T21:32:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2292355387,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyOTIzNTUzODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2292355387","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-22T21:32:35Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/486760170","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/295#issuecomment
