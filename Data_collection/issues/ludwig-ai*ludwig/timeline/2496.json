@jppgks,\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply and for clarifying the results. Including the prediction after training does the trick. \r\n\r\nIn terms of using the predictions, would it be better to train/predict on one row only in order to use that specific prediction/forecast for the feature? Excuse my ignorance but, what's the point in having a prediction for each row if the time series features contain roughly the same values from the sampled time values.\r\n\r\nAlso, when one goes about predicting at different horizons, how do you know which values must be included in the y1, y2, y3, etc. output features? Are these the previous predictions that are taken into account to forecast the subsequent values? It seems like the model would somehow need to store the previous predictions in order to use them for the next time horizon's.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for the

Ludwig's way of dealing with time series is indeed peculiar, we will likely improve it in the future, but let me try to explain the way it works.\r\n\r\nLet's assume we have a time series with values starting at 0 and increasing by 1 until 100, so 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, 100.\r\n\r\nUsually, in a timeseries dataset, those values are provided all in a column.\r\nLudwig's time series datatype assumes instead that each entry in a column is a list of numerical values. So the examples assume there's a function that widnows the data, and implicitly also creates targets.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we apply a window of 5 elements of the above timeseries and consider only one output, we will have a dataset that looks like:\r\nx, y\r\n0 1 2 3, 4\r\n1 2 3 4, 5\r\n...\r\n96 97 98 99, 100\r\n\r\nTraining on this means that at test time you will have to provide 4 values, the current last for in your current time series, to obtain the prediction of the following one.\r\n\r\nif you want to use different time horizons, you can window your dataset like:\r\nx, y1, y2\r\n0 1 2, 3, 4\r\n1 2 3, 4, 5\r\n\r\nIf you have only one output time horizon and you want to use it for predicting a new time horizon, the process will look like:\r\n```\r\ndatapoint = [0, 1, 2, 3]\r\npred = model.predict(datapoint)\r\nnew_datapoint = datapoint[1:] + [pred]\r\nnew_pred = model.predict(new_datapoint)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this help make things clearer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1249973549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7407023718,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5R4SbdzwAAAAG5fjZm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7407023718","actor":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-17T01:47:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7407023720,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5R4SbdzwAAAAG5fjZo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7407023720","actor":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-17T01:47:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1250398902","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496#issuecomment-1250398902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496","id":1250398902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5Kh5K2","user":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-18T22:26:38Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T22:27:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

In particular I obtained good results when there's one timeseries I'm trying to model and the other features are in support (like days of the week, or maybe binary indicators for specific things, like events or holidays).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1260026502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1261586156","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496#issuecomment-1261586156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2496","id":1261586156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5LMkbs","user":{"login":"camaya7","id":78824874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78824874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7","html_url":"https://github.com/camaya7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camaya7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-29T00:04:57Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T00:04:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@w4nderlust  I'm going to continue developing both approaches.
