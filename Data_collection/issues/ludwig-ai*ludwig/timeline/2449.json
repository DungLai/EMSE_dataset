If `num_samples` is not provided, default to 1 (I believe this is already the default, but if this ever changes, we should be sure to account for this case).\r\n2. If the user specified `num_samples > 1` but is using only grid search, we should issue a warning to the user, but allow trials to proceed anyway. Reason being there may be some odd scenario where the user wants to run trials more than once, for example if there is some non-determinism in the training process they want to account for.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1236254635/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7418934179,"node_id":"COE_lADOCbx2hs5RHtQvzwAAAAG6M_Oj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7418934179","actor":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-20T06:02:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7433966524,"node_id":"CE_lADOCbx2hs5RHtQvzwAAAAG7GVO8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7433966524","actor":{"login":"arnavgarg1","id":106701836,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlwkDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106701836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1","html_url":"https://github.com/arnavgarg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnavgarg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-21T20:08:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
