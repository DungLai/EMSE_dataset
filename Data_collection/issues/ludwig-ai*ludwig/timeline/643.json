I guess what you mean is making Ludwig write the code of the model somewhere instead of executing it. I'm not sure how that will improve things, it would be an additional level of indirection that would make testing things more complicated. Plus, if users want to learn by looking at how a model is built they can look at the code or even better put a breakpoint at the beginning of the build function and follow the trace to see how a model is built. I don't think generating code would make things easier.\r\nIn front of a strong argument i could change my mind
