optimization can be computationally expensive. My last experiments with Bayesian optimization took quite some time. While searching for a way to accelerate things, I stumbled across BOHB that combines bandit-based methods with Bayesian optimization. \r\n\r\nEssential to the bandit method is the \"successive halving\" technique, that is, after running all of a set of pipelines for a small budget, it drops the worse half of the pipelines and doubles the budget of the remaining pipelines. \r\n\r\nThe combined approach reduces computational time by one magnitude when used on a single machine, but more excitingly,  it scales across many GPU nodes and their experiments show 2 - 3 magnitudes of performance improvements while required a lot less GPU's less compared to other techniques. \r\n\r\nI am not able to contribute code because of my ongoing project and other commitments, but it would be great if anyone can take a closer look into this area to determine whether adding BOHB as high-performance hyper-parameter optimizer or model generator is feasible and makes sense. \r\n\r\n\r\nRepo: \r\nhttps://github.com/automl/HpBandSter\r\n\r\nPaper:\r\nhttps://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/18-ICML-BOHB.pdf\r\n\r\nBlog:\r\nhttps://www.automl.org/blog_bohb/\r\n\r\n\"Successive Halving\"\r\nhttps://www.automl.org/blog-2nd-automl-challenge/\r\n\r\nAuto-Pytorch\r\nhttps://github.com/automl/Auto-PyTorch \r\n \r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/483316719/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marvin-hansen","id":24190940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTkwOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24190940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen","html_url":"https://github.com/marvin-hansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-hansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/700349122","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/257#issuecomment-700349122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/257","id":700349122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDM0OTEyMg==","user":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T00:15:59Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T00:15:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> [ray_search.zip](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/files/3034395/ray_search.zip)\r\n> \r\n> hope this helps!\r\n\r\nGetting back to this after a long time.
