So for this reason the `__del__()` function would be empty and by consequence useless.\r\nIf you have a leak my best guess is that you either hold a reference to the object or to some internal variables of the object somewhere else, but instead of guessing it would be easier to actually take a look at the code and figuring it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/480417212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2256898291,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNTY4OTgyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2256898291","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-05T20:48:47Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/480711689","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/274#issuecomment-480711689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/274","id":480711689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDcxMTY4OQ==","user":{"login":"Guufii","id":49252109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUyMTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49252109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii","html_url":"https://github.com/Guufii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guufii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T07:12:09Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T07:12:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, thanks for your answer.
