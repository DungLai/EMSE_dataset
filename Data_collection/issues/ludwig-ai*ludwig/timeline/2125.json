not necessarily opposed to this change, but this would be a rather significant backwards compatibility layer that we'd need to maintain for a long time, so definitely want to verify that this is absolutely something we want to do. \r\n\r\n> * Specifying encoder parameters in the future SDK config object will be complicated and unintuitive because you will have to add the specific encoder parameters to the input feature as opposed the the specific encoder you want to use.\r\n\r\nWe had a [discussion](https://ludwig-ai.slack.com/archives/C02CK64TKGQ/p1643682586977809) about whether to flatten or nest for input features a while back. Here's @w4nderlust's comment:\r\n\r\n> **Not nested encoder/decoder parameters:** there’s merit to both indentation and not indentation. At the moment I’d like to keep it not indented. The main motivation being that there are some parameters in the config passed to the encoders that are added depending on data preprocessing (for instance the vocab size of a categorical embed encoder) and those may be needed by both encoders and decoders and potentially other functions within the input/output feature object and after trying for a few minutes to implement this there doesn’t seem a simple way not to break encapsulation without a substantial rework. None of this would be unsolvable, but would require more reworking than it seems at first glance, so I don’t think this is the right time for this additional reworking, so we should reconsider later on if we want to revisit this. From a PQL perspective, I think it’s fine to have encoder and decoder parameters on their own and then flatten them before passing to Ludwig. I believe the nesting is a better idea in general, don’t get me wrong, but would want to explore thoroughly nuances and corner case in the code and its impact on the config verbosity more in depth.\r\n\r\nI think the idea is that the feature module is the sole owner of its encoder submodule. The fact that the same parameters are shared between a feature module that instantiates a submodule with those parameters is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nAs Piero mentioned, there could be some additional (internal-only) parameters that are decided at preprocessing and then passed to the encoder/decoder submodule, and this is managed at the feature level -- but this is also an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nBy definition, then, there aren't any parameters (except for preprocessing which has its own subsection) that would be used exclusively at the feature level and not at the encoder submodule level. \r\n\r\n> * The code required to validate a schema without a nested module structure becomes very messy and convoluted which will only become more of a problem over time with the addition of new encoders and our value prop of extensibility.\r\n\r\n@ksbrar How difficult is it to validate a schema without the nested parameter structure? I imagine that we only need what we're already doing for the `combiner`, `trainer, and `optimizer` sections, which is to use the special `type` parameter to dictate how to validate the rest of the declared parameters within the section, i.e.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ncombiner:\r\n  type: concat\r\n  <list of parameters that should be validated against the `ConcatCombiner` combiner schema>\r\n\r\noptimizer:\r\n  type: adamw\r\n  <list of parameters that should be validated against the `adamw` optimizer schema>\r\n\r\ntrainer:\r\n  type: GBM\r\n  <list of parameters that should be validated against the `GBM` trainer schema>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPossibilities that would convince me that nesting is absolutely necessary:\r\n- There actually are parameters (except for preprocessing/internal) that would be used at the feature level and not the encoder submodule.\r\n- Validation is significantly less difficult if we do parameter nesting.\r\n- The nesting has structural value that has strong external value beyond what's reasonable to manage internally.\r\n\r\nOpen to more thoughts on this. @dantreiman @w4nderlust @tgaddair @brightsparc

chime in here if I'm missing something, but my understanding is that schema validation without the nested parameter structure would just require a lot of marshmallow `validates_schema()` logic. Since we essentially would house all the possible encoder parameters from all encoders available to a certain input feature type in that same input feature schema, we would need a complex validation function that essentially makes sure that you are not only specifying the encoder params specific to a particular encoder type. While this is entirely possible, I foresee this getting pretty complicated in the future if we end up adding any additional encoders to certain feature types.\r\n\r\nThe bigger reason I see to upgrade personally is how this schema object that we're building out maps over to the SDK. Since we want to have a config object that the user interacts with the build their models, the way that our schema is structured is essentially what the customer will be touching when using the SDK. So not only do we want this to be consistent across modules, but also we want it to be intuitive to use. If we choose to not refactor the schema and nest the encoder/decoder structure, there are potential confusion issues with customers trying to specify encoders as part of their input feature and not knowing which items to include and which not to. I also know that something we support is extensibility for encoders and while this is an area where I'm not very familiar with, I feel like a nested structure would lend well to incorporating user defined encoders. For example:\r\n```\r\ninput_features:\r\n    - name: feature_1\r\n       type: categorical\r\n       encoder:\r\n              type: user_defined_encoder\r\n              param_1: ...\r\n              param_2: ...\r\n```\r\nSomething like this makes a lot of sense from a user perspective IMO. Additionally, I imagine down the road we could even be able to create adaptable logic that can validate the schema for a user defined encoder. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I greatly appreciate your feedback and would love to hear others thoughts as well so we can decide whether we want to go through with this or not:)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1152663820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"connor-mccorm","id":97468934,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9CBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97468934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm","html_url":"https://github.com/connor-mccorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6788251760,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5LgGHGzwAAAAGUnIBw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6788251760","actor":{"login":"ksbrar","id":4261338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjEzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4261338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar","html_url":"https://github.com/ksbrar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T19:22:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6788251763,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5LgGHGzwAAAAGUnIBz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6788251763","actor":{"login":"ksbrar","id":4261338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjEzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4261338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar","html_url":"https://github.com/ksbrar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksbrar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T19:22:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6788258696,"node_id":"RTE_lADOCbx2hs5LgGHGzwAAAAGUnJuI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/6788258696","actor":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-10T19:24:02Z","rename":{"from":"Nesting

users can specify global preprocessing configuration on a per-feature basis. This is useful if users know they always want to apply certain transformations to their data for every feature of the same type. However, there is no equivalent mechanism for global encoder or decode parameters.\r\n\r\nThis proposal here is to allow the user to define global feature parameters for encoders and decoders in addition to the existing preprocessing params. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Move existing feature preprocessing globals out of the `preprocessing` section such that the preprocessing section is only for things like splitting, etc.\r\n2. Add a new `defaults` section that covers feature type defaults across all features.\r\n\r\nThese changes would also be affected by #2125, which would remove ambiguity between `encoder` and `decoder` params for the same feature type.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\npreprocessing:\r\n    split:\r\n        type: random\r\n        probabilities: [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]\r\n    oversample_minority: 0.5\r\ndefaults:\r\n    category:\r\n        preprocessing:        \r\n            missing_value_strategy: fill_with_const\r\n            fill_value: <UNK>\r\n        encoder:\r\n            type: sparse\r\n        decoder:\r\n            norm_params: null\r\n            dropout: 0\r\n            use_bias: true\r\n        loss:\r\n            type: softmax_cross_entropy\r\n            confidence_penalty: 0\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1152753113","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2125#issuecomment-1152753113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2125","id":1152753113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCbx2hs5EtZ3Z","user":{"login":"tgaddair","id":1742912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair","html_url":"https://github.com/tgaddair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgaddair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-10T21:33:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T21:34:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Different proposals:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# 1.

change enables using the `defaults` keyword within hyperopt to set default parameters for feature groups. This will help add search spaces more concisely for datasets with a large number of features while also reducing the search space to allow for a deeper search during hyperopt. \r\n\r\nFor e.g., a user can now add \r\n\r\n``` \r\n\"defaults.text.num_filters\": {\"space\": \"choice\", \"categories\": [64, 128, 256, 512]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin their hyperopt search space so that all text features (inputs and outputs) use the sampled `cell_type` for that particular trial. \r\n\r\nThe API for this change is as follows: `defaults.<feature_type>.<parameter>`, where:\r\n\r\n- `feature_type`: a valid input or output feature type, for e.g., text/category/sequence etc.\r\n- `parameter`: the parameter to search over for that particular feature type, for e.g., `embedding_size` for category features\r\n\r\nExample Configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhyperopt:\r\n    goal: minimize\r\n    parameters:\r\n        trainer.learning_rate:\r\n            lower: 0.0001\r\n            upper: 0.01\r\n            space: loguniform\r\n        defaults.text.num_filters:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        defaults.category.embedding_size:\r\n            space: choice\r\n            categories: [64, 128, 256, 512]\r\n        ....\r\n    ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: The output `status` that gets logged every few seconds will show the parameter as `defaults.text.cell_type` in the printed table with each trial status, but underneath the surface, this is getting updated correctly. This is unfortunately not something we can control, but I think it is okay to leave it this way anyway because the table width would become too large if we were to add a column for each feature whose default parameter was updated in the trial status table that gets printed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1563\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 1 12 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106701836/173437112-f8f423e7-735c-48f0-b90f-4d983cb7b1fe.png\">_ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/2133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7049671839,"node_id":"COE_lADOCbx2hs5LgGHGzwAAAAGkMXSf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7049671839","actor":{"login":"connor-mccorm","id":97468934,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9CBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97468934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm","html_url":"https://github.com/connor-mccorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-23T01:35:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7269099494,"node_id":"COE_lADOCbx2hs5LgGHGzwAAAAGxRafm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7269099494","actor":{"login":"connor-mccorm","id":97468934,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9CBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97468934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm","html_url":"https://github.com/connor-mccorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/connor-mccorm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T16:57:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
