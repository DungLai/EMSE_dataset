When you say \"I would just have 2 more output numerical features, one for the prediction at 3 minutes and one for the prediction at 5\"...how does Ludwig know to return a prediction on a 3 and 5 minute timeframe? \r\nAs a noob, my assumption is that if I feed it 1 minute data then I would expect a 1 minute prediction (unless I were to add a specific line of code). Are you saying that if I was to add new outputs like open1, open2, open3, open4, open5 Ludwig is programmed to give me 5 predictions in one minute intervals? Which is perfectly fine for this situation. \r\nWhat I don't understand is how Ludwig would know that I wanted a 3 and 5 minute prediction just by adding two new outputs.
