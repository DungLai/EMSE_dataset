At first glance it looks to me that it is a specific quirk of this dataset, and you already suggested a way around it that revolves in the user implementing a super simple 2 lines of python code script to generate the YAML, which seems like the best solution to me.\r\nAnyway, if you say that this is a common pattern in datasets (even if I kinda believe it's the wrong thing to do (it makes it really hard to use CNNs for this, which would probably be a really good model for this problem), they should just provide the images) I may reconsider this. Could you please provide a list of at least 5 datasets that use this format so that i can compare them, take a closer look and, in case I feel like it's worth the effort, consider this?\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/471421319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2192961332,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5Mjk2MTMzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2192961332","actor":{"login":"Denniso2","id":42325785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI1Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42325785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2","html_url":"https://github.com/Denniso2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T06:39:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2192961334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTI5NjEzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2192961334","actor":{"login":"Denniso2","id":42325785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI1Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42325785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2","html_url":"https://github.com/Denniso2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Denniso2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T06:39:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2192961549,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxOTI5NjE1NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2192961549","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T06:39:57Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/471511966","html_url":"https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/197#issuecomment-471511966","issu
