gmpy2-2.0.8-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl` with the correct cpXX version depending on python environment and win32\\amd64 architecture).\r\n\r\nI don't know if that could be enough, but I suppose that migrating from gmpy to gmpy2 should be fairly straightforward (I haven't seen anything about that, nor I know\\understand the purpose of this module, but I hope they have a similar shape\\size
