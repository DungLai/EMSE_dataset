@Jeffwan,\r\n\r\nJumping on the thread here.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'll say that I was able to follow the serving section of the Getting Started guide to completion.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are ways that we can clarify the walkthrough, and I also discovered a small unrelated bug (I'm doubtful that this impacted you). In any case, I'll follow up on both of these AIs.\r\n\r\nHere's a handful of pointers that might be relevant for you though, to help you get a better understanding of what you might be observing:\r\n\r\n1. The first column of the rotten tomatoes dataset is for an ID, and probably not a good feature for a model.\r\n\r\n    <img width=\"1073\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3459541/200705604-2e450363-ebad-4f5d-9186-3036beb0dd05.png\">\r\n\r\n    This is probably why in the getting started guide, we prompt you to train with a config that excludes the first column:\r\n\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    input_features:\r\n        - name: genres\r\n          type: set\r\n          preprocessing:\r\n              tokenizer: comma\r\n        - name: content_rating\r\n          type: category\r\n        - name: top_critic\r\n          type: binary\r\n        - name: runtime\r\n          type: number\r\n        - name: review_content\r\n          type: text\r\n          encoder: embed\r\n    output_features:\r\n        - name: recommended\r\n          type: binary\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Features with empty column names are given a default column name `Unnamed: 0`. Features with empty column names can be referenced with this name in the Ludwig config.\r\n\r\n3. When pinging models deployed using `ludwig serve`, it's possible to add additional feature values to the POST call. However, if these features weren't listed in the original config that was used to train the model, then the extra fields are simply ignored and have no impact on inference, for example:\r\n\r\n    These two curls should yield the exact same result:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/predict -X POST \\\r\n      -F \"movie_title=Friends With Money\" \\\r\n      -F \"content_rating=R\" \\\r\n      -F \"genres=Art House & International, Comedy, Drama\" \\\r\n      -F \"runtime=88.0\" \\\r\n      -F \"top_critic=TRUE\" \\\r\n      -F \"review_content=The cast is terrific, the movie isn't.\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/predict -X POST \\\r\n      -F \"movie_title=Friends With Money\" \\\r\n      -F \"content_rating=R\" \\\r\n      -F \"genres=Art House & International, Comedy, Drama\" \\\r\n      -F \"runtime=88.0\" \\\r\n      -F \"top_critic=TRUE\" \\\r\n      -F \"review_content=The cast is terrific, the movie isn't.\" \\\r\n      -F \"extra_feature__1=123\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. If you call `create_auto_config` from automl on this dataset, the returned config includes the empty \"id\"-like feature, and the list of input features will be:\r\n\r\n    - Unnamed: 0\r\n    - movie_title\r\n    - content_rating\r\n    - genres\r\n    - runtime\r\n    - top_critic\r\n\r\n    (as a side note, ludwig automl should probably leave out all-unique single-token id-like features by default)\r\n\r\n5. Curling the `ludwig serve` endpoint requires specifying all input features that were listed in the original config. If the model was trained with a feature with an empty column name, then there should be an `Unnamed: 0` field in your curl, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/predict -X POST \\\r\n      -F \"movie_title=Friends With Money\" \\\r\n      -F \"content_rating=R\" \\\r\n      -F \"genres=Art House & International, Comedy, Drama\" \\\r\n      -F \"runtime=88.0\" \\\r\n      -F \"top_critic=TRUE\" \\\r\n      -F \"review_content=The cast is terrific, the movie isn't.\" \\\r\n      -F \"Unnamed: 0=123\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Otherwise, you'll get the `{\"error\":\"entry must contain all input features\"}%` error.\r\n\r\n6. The models trained with and without the ID-like feature seem very different qualitatively, and thus will return different predictions and probabilities.\r\n\r\n7. One other thing to watch out for is that when re-training a model, unless you are clearing your `results` directory after every run, the new model will be saved to `results/api_experiment_run_{n}` where \"n\" increments after each subsequent run as to not override the artifacts of previous training runs. `ludwig serve` should also be initialized with the new model path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/1308269412/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinxzhao","id":3459541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTk1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3459541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/justinxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinxzhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7769805377,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCbx2hs5VsJSUzwAAAAHPHdJB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7769805377","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-09T06:21:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7769805382,"node_id":"SE_lADOCbx2hs5VsJSUzwAAAAHPHdJG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/7769805382","actor":{"login":"Jeffwan","id":4739316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzkzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4739316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffwan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-09T06:21:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
