thanks for letting us know!\r\nActually the problem is a little bit more complex: the landing page has a custom css and html that doesn't really fit with the rest of the website, which is built with mkdocs-material.\r\nSo at the moment the footer fits well with the style of the homepage, but as you noticed it is different from the style of the other pages because of spacing.\r\nYou are welcome to give it a try to make them behave in the same way, but in general it would be better if someone with frontend skills would be willing to undertake the task of making the landing and the other pages use the same css and look more similar.\r\nUnfortunately this is as far as my frontend skills go, so if there's someone else who wants to undertake the task i would be really glad to support their work as much as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/500170435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2399175008,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5OTE3NTAwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2399175008","actor":{"login":"IgorWilbert","id":42987854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg3ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42987854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert","html_url":"https://github.com/IgorWilbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:34:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2399175009,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTkxNzUwMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2399175009","actor":{"login":"IgorWilbert","id":42987854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg3ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42987854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert","html_url":"https://github.com/IgorWilbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorWilbert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:34:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2399175039,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzOTkxNzUwMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2399175039","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T22:34:21Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2399175041,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzOTkxNzUwNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repo

the footer and the top nav bar in the landing page cover all the width like the other pages will make them more consistent, and also have the same font size.\r\nAnother important thing is that now the assets for the two are scattered in different directories, consolidating would be great. Finally, when mkdocs generates its js and css files, sometimes it changes their names including some codes, I believe those are hashes of the mkdocs version or something similar.

Summary:\r\nFor #371. Fixes the `css` style of the landing page, to be similar to the others, as can be seen below .\r\n- How it is now:\r\n![result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42987854/59567838-5d123f00-9049-11e9-8a12-cb308e050c89.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n- How it should look like:\r\n![target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42987854/59567839-63082000-9049-11e9-9fa6-6222a0e04357.JPG)\r\n\r\n## Important notes:\r\n\r\n- Most critical part is the arrow, which looks too bold. It turns out all other pages except the landing page use `mkdocs-material`, that has Font Awesome arrow right weight **REGULAR**  as standard. However, if I want to use it in the html directly, only  Font Awesome arrow-right weight **SOLID** is free, the **REGULAR** needs a paid account. I tried to just copy and paste the arrow from the `css` already minified for the other pages, but then the icon breaks\r\n- I still did **not** run `mkdocs build` because there might be more style changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2464918927,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ2NDkxODkyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2464918927","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T05:07:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
