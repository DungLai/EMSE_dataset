It feels odd to depart from that convention.\r\n- Data preprocessing can be sharded across many machines, and `preprocessing` makes it clearer that we're configuring the process, rather than a specific object.\r\n\r\nThe last bullet is also why I have a preference (though slighter) for `training` instead of `trainer`, as in we're configuring the training process, rather than a specific Trainer, which is potentially instantiated on and coordinated across several machines.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraining:\r\n    checkpoint_steps: 2000\r\n    epochs: 200\r\n    tree:\r\n        criterion:

changes from @w4nderlust \r\n\r\n* numerical -> number. I prefer it over numeric because it’s a noun. Also considered numeric but in sql (at least some dialects) that’ an exact value, so it could be confusing. Also considered real, but that also may imply a certain level of approximate precision. I think number is a more neutral and general choice.\r\n* training -> trainer. The main reason for this is that I’m imagining other trainers with a type in the future (like ssl_trainer or unsupervised-trainer) which may have a different set of parameters. I see the point of considering it a shorthand for training process, but that wouldn’t work as well in a future with multiple trainers\r\n\r\nThese changes are closed by PR
