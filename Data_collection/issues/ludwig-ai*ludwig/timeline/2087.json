PR implements the preprocessing module for audio input features.\r\n\r\nAudio is very preprocessing heavy, so the bulk of this work was in making `audio_utils.py` torchscript compatible. This meant adding stricter typing and replacing numpy and scipy functions with their torch equivalents.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, some functionalities have been curtailed. The most notable is the change from `scipy.signals.window.get_window` ([Link](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.get_window.html)) to the torch implementation. Torch only has a subset of those windows implemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/1980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
