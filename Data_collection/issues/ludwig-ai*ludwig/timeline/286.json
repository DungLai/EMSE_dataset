uses signals in [model.py](https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/models/model.py#L387) for allowing the user to interrupt training and still completing the process.\r\nNot sure what causes the problem with cherrypy, I guess it doesn't like the use of signal, probably because it manages signals itself.\r\nI would suggest to try to pull the code from master, and add a check `threading.current_thread() == threading.main_thread()` as suggested in this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23206787/check-if-current-thread-is-main-thread-in-python) before importing signal and before line 387 in model.py.\r\nLet me know if it works because in case you can do a PR or I can add it myself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/comments/483152609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2275790492,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNzU3OTA0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2275790492","actor":{"login":"w4nderlust","id":349256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust","html_url":"https://github.com/w4nderlust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w4nderlust/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-15T08:14:02Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2277572472,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNzc1NzI0NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/events/2277572472","actor":{"login":"bertyhell","id":1710840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1710840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell","html_url":"https://github.com/bertyhell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"217bdd1fa76811a1ab4288859e51f99a143ba6bf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bertyhell/ludwig/commits/217bdd1fa76811a1ab4288859e51f99a143ba6bf","created_at":"2019-04-15T19:01:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bertyhell","id":1710840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1710840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell","html_url":"https://github.com/bertyhell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertyhell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-15T19:09:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-15T19:09:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/issues/287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ludwig-ai/ludwig/iss
