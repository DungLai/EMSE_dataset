It is great example of science and engineering.\r\n\r\nFor practical applications, I believe that it is important to model not just the gas phase energies/derivatives, but also the solvation and dispersion corrected energies/derivatives (correct me if I am wrong).  Do you all have a recommendation on how to best do this?  I have used the dispersion correction from the Grimme's Lab (dft-D4). I have not found a solvation correction. I have read the papers, but I did not find any comments that address this issue.\r\n\r\nI have been using AIMNet as this has the solvation correction baked into the model.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam","closed_by":{"login":"IgnacioJPickering","id":34223426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIzNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34223426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering","html_url":"https://github.com/IgnacioJPickering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/504/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
