The tensors I give it for cell and pbc are of the form:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncell = torch.eye(3, dtype=torch.double) * 10\r\npbc = torch.ones(3, dtype=torch.bool)\r\n```\r\nI have this for each configuration of atoms (ase Atoms objects). My pass to the network looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_, predicted_energies = self.torch_model(\r\n                        (species, coordinates),\r\n                        cell=cell,\r\n                        pbc=condition\r\n                    )\r\n```\r\nwhere in this case cell and condition are of the shape (n_configurations, 3, 3) for the cell and (n_configurations, 3) for condition.\r\n\r\nWhen I run this I find an error like this:\r\n```bash\r\nnum_repeats = torch.where(pbc, num_repeats, num_repeats.new_zeros(()))\r\nRuntimeError: The size of tensor a (3) must match the size of tensor b (64) at non-singleton dimension 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried to play around with the shape of the data but struggle to get anything meaningful from it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"SamTov","id":47057691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDU3Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47057691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov","html_url":"https://github.com/SamTov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamTov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
