I'm a begginer with h5py but I don't understand how the datasets should be formated. I am trying to use the last part of #611 where my species look like this:\r\n`array([['O', 'C', 'O'],\r\n           ['O', 'C', 'O'],...\r\n           ['O', 'C', 'O']])`\r\nfor one molecule. The coordinates are in the from:\r\n`[array([[[ 0.      ,  0.      ,  1.237479],\r\n              [ 0.      ,  0.      , -0.3     ],\r\n              [ 0.      ,  0.      , -1.237479]]]),...]`\r\nand the energies:\r\n`[array(226.56324331),\r\n array(208.34163576),\r\n array(191.23083335),...]`\r\nI've also tried other formats which I saved them using:\r\n`torchani.data._pyanitools.datapacker('./path_to_file', mode = 'w')`\r\nwhich after load them with: `torchani.data.load('./path_to_file')` they were tranformed as dictionaries as the examples in `ani_gdb_s01.h5` do. However, in the training part the following error is prompted:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101356745/179410781-efcae1aa-97e4-4aa6-8a45-c508fc823578.png)\r\nIf you have any suggestion please let me know.\r\nThank you in advance.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
