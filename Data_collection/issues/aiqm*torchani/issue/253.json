A possibility is\r\n\r\nAEVComputer -> Ensemble -> EnergyShifter in a **NNPEnsemble class** instead of BuiltinNet\r\nAEVComputer -> ANIModel -> EnergyShifter in a new **NNPModel class** \r\n\r\nANI1x and ANIccx inherit from **NNPEnsemble** \r\nThe individual models inside ANI1x and ANIccx are **NNPModel**\r\n\r\nThis is descriptive since \"NNP\" is something that is used to calculate QM energies that make sense from distances, so it is intuitive that if I have an \"NNP\" object I can use this directly for calculations.\r\n\r\nEnsemble and ANIModel should probably also be renamed. to reflect the fact that they only take in AEV and output a thing that is not really a good QM energy because it hasn't been shifted.\r\n\r\nI recommend something like **ANIModule** and **ANIModuleEnsemble**\r\n\r\nThis way we would have:\r\n\r\nAEVComputer -> **ANIModuleEnsemble** -> EnergyShifter in **NNPEnsemble**\r\nAEVComputer -> **ANIModule** -> EnergyShifter in **NNPModel** \r\n\r\nI would make this a project instead of an issue but I don't really know how to =)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"IgnacioJPickering","id":34223426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIzNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34223426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering","html_url":"https://github.com/IgnacioJPickering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/253/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
