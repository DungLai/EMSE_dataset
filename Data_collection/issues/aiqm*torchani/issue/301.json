I have plotted the time of a single energy evaluation with/without pbc for a rectangular waterbox vs the number of atoms in the system (always on a single CPU):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31651017/63885429-a2070a00-c9d8-11e9-93a4-bbb829c86ee9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31651017/63893713-337f7780-c9eb-11e9-9a45-9e332ca8035d.png)\r\n\r\nThe plot was generated using torch 1.1.0.dev20190521 and torchani 0.8, the code can be found here: https://gist.github.com/wiederm/699c3f119d25ebd80fcdc7affdb89d64\r\n\r\nIs this behaviour expected?
