I have modified my database to include the 3x3 cell matrix for each structure and can successfully load species, coordinates, energies, forces, and cells with `torchani.data.load`.\r\n\r\nBut, now the dimensions when the batch size is not 1 are not compatible with functions in `aev.py`. I'm more than happy to contribute and submit a pull request, but I wanted to reach out to make sure this wasn't already being developed and to also ask for some guidance. I'm mostly stuck on how to make the returned quantity from `compute_shifts(cell: Tensor, pbc: Tensor, cutoff: float) -> Tensor:` compatible with this line:\r\n\r\n`aev = compute_aev(species, coordinates, self.triu_index, self.constants(), self.sizes, (cell, shifts))`\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRay","closed_by":{"login":"rschireman","id":41241487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjQxNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41241487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman","html_url":"https://github.com/rschireman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschireman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
