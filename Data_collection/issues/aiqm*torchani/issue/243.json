This was the main source of difference in training performance.(#275)\r\n- [x] In NC the weights are initialized to He Kaiming normal and the biases to zero. (#245, #275)\r\n- [x] Loss in NC is scaled by sqrt(natoms). (#275)\r\n- [x] NC uses AdamW optimizer to update the weights and SGD for the biases. (#275)\r\n- [x] There were a couple of discrepancies between theory and the implementation of AdamW in Torchani (#261).\r\n- [x] NC scale the gradients of atomic networks by the number of atoms in that batch, and compute the gradient from SumSquaredError instead of MeanSquaredError. (will be fixed in Neurochem)\r\n- [ ] NC reshuffle the batches after every epoch (tracked in #248, no much improvement as tested, low priority)","closed_by":{"login":"zasdfgbnm","id":1032377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzIzNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1032377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm","html_url":"https://github.com/zasdfgbnm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zasdfgbnm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
