I added `pip install nose` to your list above so I could test the installation. \r\n\r\nI tried running the tests from this repository with `nosetests -v` to see everything was installed ok. \r\nThe first time I got this warning:\r\n```\r\nFailure: ModuleNotFoundError (No module named 'ase') ... ERROR\r\n```\r\nSo I added `pip install ase` and `pip install --upgrade ase`\r\n\r\nI reran the tests and I'm still getting a number of errors, some look like I still have dependencies not installed:\r\n```\r\nFailure: ModuleNotFoundError (No module named 'h5py') ... ERROR\r\n```\r\n\r\nOthers aren't as obvious:\r\n```\r\ntestWithNumericalStressWithPBCEnabled (test_ase.TestASE) ... /home/cbannan/miniconda/envs/torchani/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ase/atoms.py:762: UserWarning: Converting 3x3 stress tensor from Calculator calculator to the required Voigt form.\r\n  'calculator to the required Voigt form.')\r\n/home/cbannan/miniconda/envs/torchani/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ase/md/nvtberendsen.py:67: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in double_scalars\r\n  (self.temperature / old_temperature - 1.0) *\r\nok\r\n```\r\nwhere it looks like I'm getting a divide by 0.0 error, but the test passes? \r\n\r\nThis also came up a few times, which seems to be coming from `ase`, is there a particular version of that I should be using?\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'Atoms' object has no attribute '_cellobj'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a smaller test that would be better to start with to check that everything is installed correctly? Or at least a complete list of dependencies somewhere so I can make sure I actually have everything installed that I need?\r\nThanks again for your
