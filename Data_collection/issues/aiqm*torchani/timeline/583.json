@ndonyapour \r\nlibtorch has a bug where integer tensors are cast to torch::kDouble tensors if you call model.double() in a C++ context. \r\nI have reported this bug, however unfortunately it didn't get enough attention at the moment, maybe I failed to make myself clear at the time. \r\nThe issue can be worked around manually by adding a function in your model that recasts the tensors into integer tensors. \r\nI don't really have time right now to provide a full working solution but you can look at BuiltinModel's _recast_long_tensors method for an idea on how to solve this. \r\n\r\nI should probably raise the bug to pytorch again one of these days, unfortunately there is not much we can do on our side to fix
