Therefore the derivatives are being calculated analytically by [TorchANI](https://aiqm.github.io/torchani/examples/vibration_analysis.html\r\n). But [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/vibrations/modes.html\r\n) calculates them numerically.\r\n\r\nThanks,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/570602815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"farhadrgh","id":13050245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh","html_url":"https://github.com/farhadrgh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhadrgh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2920512653,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyMDUxMjY1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/2920512653","actor":{"login":"saeid-lab","id":48869750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODY5NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48869750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/saeid-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saeid-lab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-03T15:41:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
