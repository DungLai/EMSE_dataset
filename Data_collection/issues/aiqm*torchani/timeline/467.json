Right before your call to ``model((species, coordinates))``, can you try to call ``print(species.dtype)`` and tell us the output?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/637672229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IgnacioJPickering","id":34223426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIzNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34223426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering","html_url":"https://github.com/IgnacioJPickering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/646062540","html_url":"https://github.com/aiqm/torchani/issues/467#issuecomment-646062540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/467","id":646062540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjA2MjU0MA==","user":{"login":"hjh19970102","id":63036927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDM2OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63036927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102","html_url":"https://github.com/hjh19970102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T14:39:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T14:39:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply.\r\nI am so sorry so late reply to you.I have solve that problem according to reinstall my python yesterday.\r\ntorch.__version__: 1.6.0.dev20200610+cpu\r\nalso have one question,\r\nI try to train a simple model and get a best.pt file,and when I want to \r\npredict energy ,it will need to use something similar to your energy_force.py file,I think that instead of loading the pre-trained ANI1x model,  I need to define my own model according to https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html.\r\n\r\nBut when I substitute \"model = torch.load(\"best.pt\")\" for \"model = torchani.models.ANI1ccx(periodic_table_index=True).to(device)\",it didn\"t work.\r\nMy nnp_training.py had the same format as you supplied in the content \"examples\".\r\n\r\ncould please give me some guidances for how to use the model that be trained to predict?

I suggest reading pytorch's documentation, and a couple of the ANI papers and trying to assemble the model from the piece stored in the best.pt and the other static pieces that you probably used (AEVComputer, EnergyShifter, SpeciesConverter, etc) I'm pretty sure you will be able to do that yourself once you understand pytorch a bit better, and maybe with a bit of help of the torchani API documentation. Probably the simplest thing is to wrap all the pieces in a \"torhani.nn.Sequential\"  \r\n```\r\nnn = torch.load(\"best.pt\")\r\nmodel = torchani.nn.Sequential(species_converter, aev_computer, nn, energy_shifter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case nn is what is inside best.pt and not the whole model. Maybe checkout the other examples and you will be able to see some things similar to this that will help you if you are trying something different.\r\n\r\nI want to add that you should not do this blindly as if this was a black box, only do this if you understand to a certain extent the workings of pytorch and how ANI itself works otherwise you will get unpredictable results from what I just wrote.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/646093484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IgnacioJPickering","id":34223426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIzNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34223426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering","html_url":"https://github.com/IgnacioJPickering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3458686692,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ1ODY4NjY5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/3458686692","actor":{"login":"hjh19970102","id":63036927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDM2OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63036927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102","html_url":"https://github.com/hjh19970102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-18T15:23:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3458686695,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0NTg2ODY2OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/3458686695","actor":{"login":"hjh19970102","id":63036927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDM2OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63036927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102","html_url":"https://github.com/hjh19970102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-18T15:23:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/646389022","html_url":"https://github.com/aiqm/torchani/issues/467#issuecomment-646389022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/467","id":646389022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjM4OTAyMg==","user":{"login":"hjh19970102","id":63036927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDM2OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63036927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102","html_url":"https://github.com/hjh19970102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjh19970102/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T01:45:09Z
