I need to process many many small molecules/crystals. GPU is probably not useful in this case (if I understand it correctly). The optimized geometries will be passed to my other calculators. So splitting them to a few separate ANI runs is not really convenient. The model won't be perfect, I am curious how it is compared to the generic force fields.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I appreciate if you can take a
