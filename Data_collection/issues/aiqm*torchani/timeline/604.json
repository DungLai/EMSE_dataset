It seems your system is too large to fit into your GPU memory. At this point, we implemented only direct algorithms that would be memory-bound depending on matrix sizes. Therefore you have two choices: i) reduce system size, ii) get a GPU with more memory. \r\n\r\nWe are working to make simulations plugins into LAMMPS and AMBER, with domain decomposition you would be able to run much larger systems in a distributed fashion.
