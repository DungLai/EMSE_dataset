At evaluation time ANI models execute an energy shifter that adds this linear fitting automatically.\r\n \r\n In your case, suppose the energy in the dataset is `E_qm`, with `subtract_self_energies` you are effectively transforming this energy into `E_shifted_qm = E_qm - E_self`, but since ANI models add this extra energy automatically because they execute the energy shifter, the ANI model will predict `E_qm = E_shifted_qm + E_self`, this means you are comparing two incompatible energies, and this is why you are getting this discrepancy.\r\n \r\n If you remove the line `subtract_self_energies... etc` from your script the discrepancy goes away and you will see that the performance is consistent with the papers.\r\n \r\n Edit: I remove the latex since it seems that github still doesn't support it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/comments/854107160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IgnacioJPickering","id":34223426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIzNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34223426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering","html_url":"https://github.com/IgnacioJPickering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgnacioJPickering/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4839326341,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDgzOTMyNjM0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/4839326341","actor":{"login":"aarontuor","id":9738133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzgxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9738133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor","html_url":"https://github.com/aarontuor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-03T19:04:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4839326346,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4MzkzMjYzNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/4839326346","actor":{"login":"aarontuor","id":9738133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzgxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9738133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor","html_url":"https://github.com/aarontuor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarontuor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-03T19:04:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5542678909,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5237M40uZrjzwAAAAFKXpF9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiqm/torchani/issues/events/5542678909","actor":{"login":"yueyericardo","id":9999318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTkzMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9999318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo","html_url":"https://github.com/yueyericardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yueyericardo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-29T20:30:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
