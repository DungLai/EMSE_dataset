Meanwhile, the problem of predicting the next word only requires the probability of the last word.\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-03 12-48-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7200425/57121551-8aa96e80-6da2-11e9-8003-a77344aa333d.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lopuhin/transformer-lm/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lopuhin/transformer-lm/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
