I started working the single gpu training using the pytorch script. On P100 it estimates around 6 hours for one epoch. I was hoping that when running on 4x P100 that I would get 4x speed up. But it seems that I still get 6 hours per epoch. \r\n\r\nZaid ","closed_by":{"login":"zaidalyafeai","id":15667714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjY3NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15667714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai","html_url":"https://github.com/zaidalyafeai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaidalyafeai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lopuhin/transformer-lm/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lopuhin/transformer-lm/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
