Since the ToolBox object does not create a copy but instead only stores a reference to y, the actual values in y are changed as well. Other strategies in query_labels.py do not display such behavior. \r\n\r\nThis to me seems problematic, as the original data should not be changed. It is also a problem because if you run several models from the same ToolBox object, that object in general should not change between models.\r\n\r\nSee screenshot for quick demonstration, the data is split in X and y, both np.arrays. Y is either 0 or 1 (see printouts).\r\n\r\nI use colab, so the alipy version is always freshly installed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"719\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2021-06-23 um 14 01 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50079371/123093455-0146d180-d42c-11eb-9c1a-4269844ad534.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tangypnuaa","id":40466308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDY2MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40466308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa","html_url":"https://github.com/tangypnuaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
