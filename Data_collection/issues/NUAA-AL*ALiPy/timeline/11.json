When I say uncertainty sampling and batch size, shouldn't the algorithm already understand to choose the examples ?\r\n\r\nAlso, when I update the training set with the queried elements from the test set, do they automatically get deleted from the test set ? If not, how can I remove them ? Please advise.\r\n\r\nThank you so much !!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/481470525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sreevarsha","id":8831005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzEwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8831005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha","html_url":"https://github.com/sreevarsha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreevarsha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/481680387","html_url":"https://github.com/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/11#issuecomment-481680387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/11","id":481680387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTY4MDM4Nw==","user":{"login":"tangypnuaa","id":40466308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDY2MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40466308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa","html_url":"https://github.com/tangypnuaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T12:59:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T12:59:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"1\\. The best option is using your target model to select instance. But if you are not using a sklearn model AND you don't know how to re-encapsulate it, you can use the default model at the expense of some performance for convenience.

Note that, uncertainty has the function `select_by_prediction_mat()`. You can provide the probabilistic prediction matrix of your own model to select instance instead of passing your model, shape is usually like [n_samples, n_classes].\r\n\r\n2\\.
