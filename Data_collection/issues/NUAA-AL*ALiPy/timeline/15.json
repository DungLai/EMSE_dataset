this exception will be raised if the `label_size` parameter is not given and the inference of its value is also failed when initializing a `MultiLabelIndexCollection` object.\r\n\r\nThis should be a bug in the multi thread class. \r\nYou can update alipy with the code in dev branch, or create the `acethread` object manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom alipy.utils.multi_thread import aceThreading\r\nacethread  = aceThreading(examples=X, labels=mult_y,\r\n                            train_idx=train_idx, test_idx=test_idx,\r\n                            label_index=label_idx,\r\n                            unlabel_index=unlabel_idx,\r\n                            refresh_interval=refresh_interval,\r\n                            max_thread=max_thread,\r\n

object.\r\n\r\nBesides, the predicted (and ground-truth `mult_y[mult_y == 0] = -1`) irrelevant label is -1 not 0 in LabelRank model, so your code of calculation of micro-f1 may not work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/475523499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tangypnuaa","id":40466308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDY2MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40466308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa","html_url":"https://github.com/tangypnuaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/475852728","html_url":"https://github.com/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/15#issuecomment-475852728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/15","id":475852728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTg1MjcyOA==","user":{"login":"ZMK112","id":24214864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjE0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24214864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112","html_url":"https://github.com/ZMK112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZMK112/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-23T08:51:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-23T08:51:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
