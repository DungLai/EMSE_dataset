If that is the case, the strategies should work with a 2d or 3d feature matrix, because they use the models' own predict_proba method? So in conclusion, if the model accepts a 3D input feature matrix, the query strategy method should do as well? \r\n\r\nPls correct me if I am wrong, but I dont see the need for this 2D constraint. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/489414010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alexv1247","id":46656795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjU2Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46656795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247","html_url":"https://github.com/alexv1247","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexv1247/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/489420809","html_url":"https://github.com/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/16#issuecomment-489420809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/16","id":489420809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQyMDgwOQ==","user":{"login":"tangypnuaa","id":40466308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDY2MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40466308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa","html_url":"https://github.com/tangypnuaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-05T12:13:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T12:13:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi, alexv1247! \r\nThat's a very good question. \r\n\r\nActually there are two different settings to do the sample selection in active learning. One is purely relying on unsupervised approach to select samples based on the data structure of unlabeled samples without any knowledge of the ground truth labels (e.g., QUIRE, GraphDensity, Random); the other is selecting samples with the help of an initially trained supervised classifier based on a seed set of limited labeled samples.\r\n\r\nFor the 1st setting, QUIRE and GraphDensity needs to calculate the kernel which is defined on vector.\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd setting, some methods only depend on the otucome of the predict_proba (e.g., Uncertainty). You don't even need to provide the feature matrix or model to select unlabeled data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nunc = QueryInstanceUncertainty()\r\nunc.select_by_prediction_mat(unlabel_index, predict, batch_size=1)\r\n\r\nqbc = QueryInstanceQBC(method='query_by_bagging', disagreement='KL_divergence')\r\ncommittee_predict = [predict_mat1, predict_mat2, predict_mat3]\r\nqbc.select_by_prediction_mat(unlabel_index, committee_predict , batch_size=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor EER method, it's technically sound if you want to use a keras model because EER does not use the feature at all. However, we use the sklearn function `check_X_y` to make sure the input is legal which enforces X 2d and y 1d. Maybe you can try this to avoid the validity checking:\r\n\r\n```\r\neer = QureyExpectedErrorReduction(X=None, y=None)\r\neer.X = X3d\r\neer.y = y\r\neer.select(label_index, unlabel_index, model=keras_model, batch_size=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, your model should implement `fit` and `predict_proba` methods. Or you can modify the source code directly to make the EER algorithm available for keras model.\r\n\r\nHowever, some other methods use a specified model according to the paper which is trained and used inside the algorithm (e.g., LAL, BMDR, AURO, AUDI, HALC). \r\n\r\nSpecifically, LAL uses a RF to extract feature of unlabeled data for score prediction, higher score means more valuable. But some features only can be provided by RF (average depth of the trees in the forest, out of bag estimation). If you want to use another model, you may have to design a new feature extraction method for score prediction. \r\n\r\nAURO and AUDI use a LabelRanking model which accepts instance-label pairs for training, and can provide special information that will be used in active selection. HALC uses 'one vs the rest' SVM for multi-label classification. \r\n\r\nThe optimization of BMDR depends directly on a linear classification model according to the paper, if you want to change another model or another loss function, you may have to re-implement the optimization function. \r\n\r\nIn this case, some specified models do not accept a 3D input shape.
