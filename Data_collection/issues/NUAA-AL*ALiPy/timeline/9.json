For now, please set `multi_thread=False` if you are using a multi_thread model.\r\n\r\nTo install cvxpy, a C compiler is needed which may not be installed by everyone in Windows platform. So we make it an optional dependency because only SPAL and BMDR methods depend on this package.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/470858634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tangypnuaa","id":40466308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDY2MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40466308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa","html_url":"https://github.com/tangypnuaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangypnuaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
