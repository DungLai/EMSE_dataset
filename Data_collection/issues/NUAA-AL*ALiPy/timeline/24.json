The default Logistic Regression classifier can easily fit. And there may be a lot of samples that is similar. It would be useless to add the similar samples after the one has been learned by the model.\r\nAnd the results of a single experiment may be random. The results are more convincing if the number of experiments(round) is set as a large value.\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee that the QBC is must better than Random in any case. The QBC is generally better.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/557374101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lggggggx","id":13412302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13412302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx","html_url":"https://github.com/Lggggggx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lggggggx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/comments/557377230","html_url":"https://github.com/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/24#issuecomment-557377230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NUAA-AL/ALiPy/issues/24","id":557377230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzM3NzIzMA==","user":{"login":"PingjieTang","id":3790815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTA4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3790815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang","html_url":"https://github.com/PingjieTang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingjieTang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T03:51:40Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T03:51:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the quick response, which generally addressed my issue.
