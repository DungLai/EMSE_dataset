We need to do ROI align on the ground truth mask to get c_n. The boxes for ROI align are the predicted boxes from box regression? And i, j respectively ranges from 0 to 126 if we decide to unflatten RoW and resize it to 127x127? This has a very similar flavor to MaskRCNN.\r\nBTW, there seems to be a bug here https://github.com/foolwood/SiamMask/blob/master/tools/test.py#L257 if refine_enable is set False. We need to do bilinear sampling here instead of just view()","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/foolwood/SiamMask/issues/comments/473500781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"qchenclaire","id":24658370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU4Mzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24658370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire","html_url":"https://github.com/qchenclaire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2212202187,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIxMjIwMjE4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/foolwood/SiamMask/issues/events/2212202187","actor":{"login":"qchenclaire","id":24658370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU4Mzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24658370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire","html_url":"https://github.com/qchenclaire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qchenclaire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-19T01:53:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
