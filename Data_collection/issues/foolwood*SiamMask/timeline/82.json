Because in the adjustlayer model, the code is \r\n                 if  x.size(3) < 20:\r\n                       l = 4\r\n                       r = l+ 7\r\n                       x = x[:, :,  l:r, l:r]\r\n                return x\r\n         so the template output feature size is  b * c  * 7 * 7. when you delete this part , you can practice the result of paper, the row is 17 * 17 * 256.I have done it ,but the result is bad. because Row become smaller.At the same time, when you test the trained model, if you face this state----- in the select_ROI the object occupy in the center of box, but object has lower rate than background in the box. The model only learn more background feature , it cause that the tracker is failure. \r\n         Therefore, I don't advise you delete this part code, you can modify the padding (0-16，0-8， 0-4）.Just like in the test state, the refine model does a padding. I am trying it , but the batch size is a problem. I set batch size 2, it still appears ' CUDA out of memory' . when I set batch size 1, the mask_loss is 0.
