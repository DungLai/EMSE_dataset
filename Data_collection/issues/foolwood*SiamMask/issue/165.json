I am interested in your project and i met some problem when i try to improve the refinement network . I add some modules to the refinement network and want to retrain the refinement. But the pre-trained model you provide is in accordance with 'custom' structure . Could i ask for a pre-trained siammask base model if it is convenient for u? Because i don't have enough source to train the base model. My email is chenxinxin970717@163.com.
