I only wanted to generate a tensorboard summary, so these issues might occur in other places of the code as well.\r\n\r\nI used this code to fix the issues:\r\n```\r\ndef write_summary(dpath, aggregations_per_key):\r\n    writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(str(dpath))\r\n\r\n    for key, (steps, wall_times, aggregations) in aggregations_per_key.items():\r\n        for step, wall_time, aggregation in zip(steps, wall_times, aggregations):\r\n            with writer.as_default():\r\n                tf.summary.scalar(key, aggregation, step=step)\r\n                writer.flush()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am definitely not experienced in Tensorflow. I did a quick internet search and updated your code.\r\nI created this issue to make you aware of these migration issues, as well as to help other users with the same problems.\r\n\r\nMy versions:\r\nPandas: 1.2.4\r\nNumpy: 1.19.5\r\nTensorflow: 2.4.1\r\nTensorboard: 2.5.0\r\n\r\nHave a great day.\r\nCheers.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/9/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
