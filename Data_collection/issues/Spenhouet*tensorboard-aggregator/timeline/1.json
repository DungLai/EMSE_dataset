are two issues here.\r\n\r\nFirst the one that you reported. I now could reproduce it.\r\nThe problem stems from a somehow corrupted run you had.\r\nThe scalar `Losses/ReconLoss` has different step counts for both runs.\r\nOne run was 516 steps and the other 521 steps long.\r\nOne run endet after 277500 iterations and one after 280000.\r\nThese steps need to match or else it is not possible to aggregate over the missing portion of steps.\r\nThat is where the error is coming from.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is, that even if the one run wouldn't be corrupted it currently wouldn't work.\r\nThe current implementation assumes that for all scalars all step counts are the same but in your event files most scalars have 11 steps but this one scalar has 521.\r\nIm working on the support of different step sizes of different scalars so that only the steps for one scalar need to be equal.\r\n\r\n@Chazzz For your failed run (events.out.tfevents.1549493) you will need to rerun it to get a valid run. After I implemented the support for different step counts for different scalars it then should work for you.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/comments/461617162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Spenhouet","id":7819068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2125725050,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEyNTcyNTA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/events/2125725050","actor":{"login":"Chazzz","id":270857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/270857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz","html_url":"https://github.com/Chazzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-07T22:21:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2125725051,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMjU3MjUwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/events/2125725051","actor":{"login":"Chazzz","id":270857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/270857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz","html_url":"https://github.com/Chazzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chazzz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-07T22:21:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2125890158,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxMjU4OTAxNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/events/2125890158","actor":{"login":"Spenhouet","id":7819068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8b3b603fc96ce26f554fc46f50c451794e0dc8fc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/commits/8b3b603fc96ce26f554fc46f50c451794e0dc8fc","created_at":"2019-02-07T23:56:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/com

project is meant for researchers and should be usable for paper publications (e.g. exporting multi run aggregates to csv for latex usage).\r\nWith allowing runs to have diverging step numbers will lead to wrong aggregates and therefore to false paper results.\r\nI'm not inclined to make it easier to fall in traps like that. If the aggregation runs without any error message while processing corrupted runs a user could be led to think everything is fine.\r\nFor example: Averaging over multiple values and wall times while these are from different steps results in wrong results.\r\nThat is why I don't see any way that I want support for it.\r\n\r\nThanks to you this project got more flexible in regards to other workflows.
