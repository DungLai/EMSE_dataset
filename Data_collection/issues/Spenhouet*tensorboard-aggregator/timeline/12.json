i managed to get a script that merges the manually downloaded CSVs into a single csv, for anyone who would need something like this:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport glob\r\nfrom run_name_getter import *\r\n\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfiles = glob.glob(\"movingForward/*.csv\")\r\n\r\nif len(files) == 0: raise BaseException(\"no files\")\r\n\r\nstep_column = pd.read_csv(files[0], usecols=['Step'])\r\n\r\nall_csvs = [pd.read_csv(p, usecols=['Value']) for p in files]\r\n\r\nfor i in range(len(all_csvs)):\r\n    csv = all_csvs[i]\r\n    run_name = get_run_name(files[i])\r\n    csv.columns = [run_name]\r\n\r\nmetric_name = get_metric_name(files[0])\r\n\r\nall_csvs = [step_column] + all_csvs\r\n\r\ndf = pd.concat(all_csvs, axis=1)\r\n\r\ndf.plot(x=\"Step\", alpha=0.5, title=metric_name)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nthe only downside now is I have to manually download each CSV for each run for each
