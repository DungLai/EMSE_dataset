I don't really see the problem with that since it is just another python package someone needs to have installed. A thing of some seconds. I therefore do not worry to much about the summary being written by TF or pytorch.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The only issue is that TF 1.x is relatively out-dated by now. If I would update this package, I would probably also do it with pytorch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/comments/817532254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Spenhouet","id":7819068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/comments/817534356","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/8#issuecomment-817534356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spenhouet/tensorboard-aggregator/issues/8","id":817534356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzUzNDM1Ng==","user":{"login":"janosh","id":30958850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30958850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh","html_url":"https://github.com/janosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T06:48:05Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T06:48:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
