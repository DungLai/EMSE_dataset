Was able to train on cityscapes and coco dataset and prediction is good on the objects (both cityscapes and coco) but there is noise in most of the predictions. I see there is a noise even in the image you have posted ((c) predicted result - noise on the road red color at the bottom). Is it possible to reduce this noise by tuning any hyperparameter while training?   Any thoughts ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tramac/Fast-SCNN-pytorch/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tramac/Fast-SCNN-pytorch/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
