From my understanding you at first have to calculate the Intersection of Union for each class that occures in the target image. Then you have to take the mean. What you do is summing up all pixels that fall inside the union or the intersection and simply take the average. This leads to an incorrect metric from my understand. Please correct me if I am wrong. It is pretty clearly stated here **averaged over all classes**: \\url{https://www.jeremyjordan.me/evaluating-image-segmentation-models/} ","closed_by":{"login":"JonasFrey96","id":56234378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjM0Mzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56234378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96","html_url":"https://github.com/JonasFrey96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasFrey96/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tramac/Fast-SCNN-pytorch/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tramac/Fast-SCNN-pytorch/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
