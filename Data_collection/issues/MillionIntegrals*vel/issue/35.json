Here are the results of 50 runs for one particular set of hyperparameters:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16848331/49898740-d1b0ba80-fe27-11e8-9940-88c3b8da66b4.png)\r\n\r\nI was a little bit surprised to see negative rewards here. Do you know how the Enduro environment can return negative rewards?\r\n\r\nThere was another curious case for the best configuration found through random search. I found that many of the evaluations only managed to run for a handful of frames. When running 50 runs of the environment in this case, only 12 runs made it past 1000 frames. Unfortunately all the rewards remained at 0.0 here. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16848331/49899161-e93c7300-fe28-11e8-824e-ad2270505c67.png)\r\n\r\nWould you have any recommendations for me to dig into why this particular configuration seems to fail often, and only returns 0.0 rewards for the remaining runs? If you are curious, here is the configuration I was using: [random search yaml](https://github.com/yngtodd/vel/blob/master/examples-configs/rl/atari/journal/acer/random_enduro_acer.yaml).
