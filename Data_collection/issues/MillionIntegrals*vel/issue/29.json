I'm trying to install vel to use with a custom OpenAI Gym environment that I'm creating.\r\n\r\nI ran the command found in the README: `pip3 install vel[gym,mongo,visdom]`. Unfortunately, the install is repeatedly failing because of missing dependencies, and I'm having to hunt and peck to find which ones. In particular, the pillow and mujoco libraries are pulling in a lot of extra dependencies: zlib, cffi, Cython, jpeg, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I feel like there are not many good options for RL in PyTorch. I would like to see something better take hold. I think that one way you could help vel gain traction is by making it easier to install. Minimize unnecessary dependencies, and you will help ensure that it doesn't fail to install when new users try it. Most people who try open source software, if it doesn't work out of the box, will just try something else and never look back. In my case, I have absolutely no need for mujoco environments. I don't think these should be installed by default. All I really want is to have access to a quality ppo implementation.","closed_by":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
