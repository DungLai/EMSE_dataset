During training, all metrics are stored and recorded in MongoDB (for long-term storage) and in visdom (for visualization). The way how I work with it, is that I use Visdom to visually inspect if training is doing what it should and then potentially load results with Python from MongoDB to process them for various reasons.\r\n\r\nThat's how the example Visdom chart looks like:\r\n![newplot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2262651/47832528-49ee7f80-dd96-11e8-9518-f19dc4b1a8a2.png)\r\n\r\nMetrics stored in the DB:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> db.metrics.find({'model_name': 'breakout_a2c'})\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5bc5310155cd970dcb4f25f5\"), \"epoch_idx\" : 0, \"frames\" : 8000, \"fps\" : 1489, \"PMM:episode_rewards\" : 1.878787878787879, \"P09:episode_rewards\" : 3.8000000000000007, \"P01:episode_rewards\" : 0, \"episode_length\" : 197.0909090909091, \"value_loss\" : 0.02023520267427557, \"policy_entropy\" : 1.3809912633895873, \"policy_loss\" : 0.006739899950334802, \"grad_norm\" : 0.09930057158654704, \"advantage_norm\" : 1.4973756862804293, \"explained_variance\" : -0.25901189506053923, \"model_name\" : \"breakout_a2c\", \"run_name\" : \"breakout_a2c/1\" }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5bcc22ee55cd974f28595b33\"), \"epoch_idx\" : 1, \"frames\" : 6000, \"fps\" : 1391, \"PMM:episode_rewards\" : 1.2142857142857142, \"P09:episode_rewards\" : 3, \"P01:episode_rewards\" : 0, \"episode_length\" : 178.75, \"value_loss\" : 0.01603925398577303, \"policy_entropy\" : 1.3837194800376893, \"policy_loss\" : 0.0020585690875304864, \"grad_norm\" : 0.12393458011152558, \"advantage_norm\" : 0.9929843093454838, \"explained_variance\" : -1.671451603770256, \"model_name\" : \"breakout_a2c\", \"run_name\" : \"breakout_a2c/2\" }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5bcc22f355cd974f28595b34\"), \"epoch_idx\" : 2, \"frames\" : 12000, \"fps\" : 1311, \"PMM:episode_rewards\" : 1.2, \"P09:episode_rewards\" : 3, \"P01:episode_rewards\" : 0, \"episode_length\" : 178.06666666666666, \"value_loss\" : 0.018758475972190353, \"policy_entropy\" : 1.3858475637435914, \"policy_loss\" : 0.005217389368335716, \"grad_norm\" : 0.0655856565352905, \"advantage_norm\" : 1.2349432955682278, \"explained_variance\" : 0.013082603216171265, \"model_name\" : \"breakout_a2c\", \"run_name\" : \"breakout_a2c/2\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also implemented to output metrics what I call in the \"OpenAI\" format, that is used in their baselines repository, but it is off by default - That's why you see output/openai directory empty. To enable that, two changes need to be done in the config file:\r\n\r\nSet logging to true in the command definition will log metrics to the CSV file `vel/output/openai/breakout_a2c/0/progress.csv`\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ncommands:\r\n  train:\r\n    name: vel.rl.commands.rl_train_command\r\n    total_frames: 1.0e6\r\n    batches_per_epoch: 20\r\n\r\n    openai_logging: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you turn on `monitor` in the environment, some information about environment episodes will be written to the file `vel/output/openai/breakout_a2c/0/0.monitor.csv` etc:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nenv:\r\n  name: vel.rl.env.classic_atari\r\n  game: 'BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4'\r\n  env_settings:\r\n    default:\r\n      monitor: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you run the **train** command, the command `vel.rl.commands.rl_train_command` will run, which is a generic reinforcement learning training loop. What it does it trains the model on an environment rollouts, stores the metrics in a set of locations discussed above and stores model checkpoints in `output/checkpoints` directory.\r\n\r\nTo access models that were checkpointed to e.g. record video I've used different commands. So for example if you change your command line to\r\n\r\n```\r\nvel examples-configs/rl/atari/a2c/breakout_a2c.yaml record\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe record command will be invoked which is configured in this bit of config file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  record:\r\n    name: vel.rl.commands.record_movie_command\r\n    takes: 10\r\n    videoname: 'breakout_vid_{:04}.avi'\r\n    frame_history: 4\r\n    sample_args:\r\n      argmax_sampling: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will run saved model on 10 environment episodes and store the videos from these runs into `output/videos` directory. \r\n\r\nThere are also some other commands defined, like **evaluate**:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  evaluate:\r\n    name: vel.rl.commands.evaluate_env_command\r\n    takes: 100\r\n    frame_history: 4\r\n    sample_args:\r\n      argmax_sampling: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich does run model checkpoint on an environment 100 times to calculate some statistics over rewards/episode lengths to evaluate models to each other.\r\n\r\nThere is also a **visdom** command, which basically copies saved down metrics from MongoDB to visdom, as any data in visdom is lost on restart, so I needed a way to repopulate that data to view it:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    visdom:\r\n        name: vel.commands.vis_store_command\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope I've answered your question, feel free to let me know if anything is unclear ;) I just realized one of my refactorings broke movie recording in the latest master commit, I'll get that fixed soon.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/434929230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1939629559,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5Mzk2Mjk1NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/events/1939629559","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-01T05:02:13Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/435062827","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/25#issuecomment-435062827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/25","id":435062827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTA2MjgyNw==","user":{"login":"yngtodd","id":16848331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ4MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16848331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd","html_url":"https://github.com/yngtodd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-01T14:44:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T14:44:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That
