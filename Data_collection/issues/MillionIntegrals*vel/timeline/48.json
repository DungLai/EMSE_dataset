In some games, (from the top of my head it's e.g. Montezuma's Revenge and Qbert) each time you play you have several \"lives\". Generally the atari environment considers your episode finished when you lose all of those \"lives\". But as done in the DQN paper, it helps training the network if at least during policy training each of the \"lives\" is treated as a separate episode completely independent of the others.\r\n\r\n- `FireResetEnv` and `FireEpisodicLifeEnv`- they are mostly independent (from `EpisodicLifeEnv`), but there are some subtleties. In general, `FireResetEnv` presses `FIRE` action whenever an env resets. That's needed in e.g. Breakout to start the game. \r\n\r\n- `FireEpisodicLifeEnv` is a bugfix I've introduced myself and now I see the naming is super confusing. Basically what happens there is: If we're **not using** `EpisodicLifeEnv`, then there will be times when an agent loses life but are **not the end of episode**. At these times it may be also the case that game stops and waits for the `FIRE` action. So `FireEpisodicLifeEnv` is a wrapper similar to `FireResetEnv`, but in addition to pressing `FIRE` only when an env is reset also presses `FIRE` after an agent loses a life. This modification was needed for some environments to work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything is still unclear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/494432894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/494616445","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/48#issuecomment-494616445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/48","id":494616445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDYxNjQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"phizaz","id":451667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/451667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz","html_url":"https://github.com/phizaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T01:25:01Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T01:25:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@MillionIntegrals
