The good thing about orthogonal initialization is that the columns of weight matrix are orthogonal to one another, which should encourage them to learn different features if possible. \r\n\r\nIn general for most of these tasks, probably any reasonable initialization would work, but (without performing detailed experiments on the topic) I think orthogonal initialization should steer the SGD towards faster convergence by utilizing the weight matrix better for representing varied features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/500183848/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2399789066,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM5OTc4OTA2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/events/2399789066","actor":{"login":"phizaz","id":451667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/451667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz","html_url":"https://github.com/phizaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phizaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-10T02:23:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
