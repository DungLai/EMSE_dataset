To run the model, one needs YAML configuration of the model (like the one you're trying to run) and additionally a *project* configuration containing share configuration for the whole project.\r\n\r\nThis file is called `.velproject.yaml` and current default implementation configures it to store metrics in MongoDB and to use Visdom:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstorage:\r\n  name: vel.storage.classic\r\n\r\n  backend:\r\n    name: vel.storage.backend.mongodb\r\n    uri: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/'\r\n    database: deep_learning\r\n\r\n  streaming:\r\n    - name: vel.storage.streaming.visdom\r\n    - name: vel.storage.streaming.stdout\r\n\r\n\r\ncheckpoint_strategy:\r\n  name: vel.storage.strategy.classic_checkpoint_strategy\r\n\r\n\r\nvisdom_settings:\r\n  stream_lr: false\r\n  server: 'http://localhost'\r\n  port: 8097\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case you don't want that, I've added also a simple file that does not have any extra dependencies, but then does not store anything for later inspection, only writes to stdout:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstorage:\r\n  name: vel.storage.classic\r\n\r\n  backend:\r\n    name: vel.storage.backend.dummy\r\n\r\n  streaming:\r\n    - name: vel.storage.streaming.stdout\r\n\r\n\r\ncheckpoint_strategy:\r\n  name: vel.storage.strategy.classic_checkpoint_strategy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also a few examples in the `examples-scripts` directory about how to run models without yaml configs, just using script files, although I'm using that less myself so that could be a bit less fleshed out.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need to know anything more and in the meantime, I'll update REAME to be a bit clearer when I have some time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/440937972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/440941178","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/30#issuecomment-440941178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/30","id":440941178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDk0MTE3OA==","user":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-22T07:47:15Z","updated_at":"2018-11-22T07:47:15Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"One extra remark is that while project is under active development, pip version is a bit out of date compared to the latest repository version.

Usually in the model you also need to adjust some parameters so that the input size it expects matches the observation output of your environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/441097650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/441336411","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/30#issuecomment-441336411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/30","id":441336411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTMzNjQxMQ==","user":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-24T01:45:11Z","updated_at":"2018-11-24T01:45:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I took some time to check out your projects and I must say I love the environments you've implemented.

Write simple setup.py for vel-miniworld and install locally, like @yngtodd did\r\n2. I just pushed a new commit for vel that should solve the problem, adding missing directory to PYTHONPATH, but then you need to install newest master git checkout of vel to have that fix\r\n3. Instead of running the example using the `vel` script:\r\n```\r\nvel examples-configs/ppo/ppo_miniworld_hallway.yaml train\r\n```\r\nExecute it using the python module run syntax:\r\n```\r\npython -m vel.launcher examples-configs/ppo/ppo_miniworld_hallway.yaml train\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these solutions work for me.
