It was definitely my goal for Mujoco not to be required for a simple installation. In the setup.py file that defines the dependencies, they look as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninstall_requires=[\r\n        'attrs',\r\n        'pyyaml',\r\n        'numpy',\r\n        'pandas',\r\n        'scikit-learn',\r\n        'torch == 0.4.1',\r\n        'torchvision',\r\n        'opencv-python',\r\n        'pillow-simd',\r\n        'tqdm'\r\n    ],\r\n    extras_require={\r\n        'visdom': ['visdom'],\r\n        'mongo': ['pymongo', 'dnspython'],\r\n        'gym': ['gym[atari,box2d,classic_control]'],\r\n        'mujoco': ['gym[mujoco,robotics]'],\r\n        'dev': ['nose']\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I tried installing not only on my local machine but on several cloud machines and I didn't have to install mujoco there, because I didn't have the cloud license. As above, mujoco will be installed only if requested explicitly with pip install vel[mujoco].\r\n\r\nYou can also take a look at the dockerfile, that is used to install vel on the ubuntu image with pytorch/cuda preinstalled but no MuJoCo:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM anibali/pytorch:cuda-9.2\r\nMAINTAINER Jerry Tworek\r\n\r\nENV LC_ALL=C.UTF-8\r\nENV LANG=C.UTF-8\r\nUSER user\r\n\r\n# Install some basic utilities\r\nRUN sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc g++ make cmake zlib1g-dev swig libsm6 libxext6 && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n\r\nRUN pip install -U pip cython\r\nCOPY --chown=user:user . /vel\r\nWORKDIR /vel\r\nRUN pip install -e .[gym,mongo]\r\nRUN mv .velproject.docker.yaml .velproject.yaml\r\n\r\nCMD vel examples-configs/rl/atari/a2c/breakout_a2c.yaml train -d cuda:0\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any further troubles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/440939977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/441078233","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/29#issuecomment-441078233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/29","id":441078233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTA3ODIzMw==","user":{"login":"maximecb","id":713766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb","html_url":"https://github.com/maximecb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximecb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-22T16:27:44Z","updated_at":"2018-11-22T16:27:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm trying to install with `pip3 install -e .` on a different machine running Ubuntu 18.04.
