If you're plotting just mean +/- std dev of various runs, then it's quite likely if the distribution is skewed to see that the graph goes slightly below zero even if you don't really see any negative rewards. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can see you're quite lucky to get ACER running on enduro at all. If you look at my benchmarks on the blog: https://blog.millionintegrals.com/vel-pytorch-meets-baselines/ or from OpenAI baselines: https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/benchmarks_atari10M.htm then you can see that ACER generally does not work at all on Enduro. \r\n\r\nAs far as it seems, with current parametrizations I have only PPO and DQN work on that problem.\r\n\r\nIf the question is why, then I honestly don't know. If you learn anything about that I'd be quite interested in knowing. \r\n\r\nFew usual things to check would be:\r\n- Exploration, maybe rewards are sparse enough that some algos just cannot reliably reach them? Possibly connected to the next one.\r\n- Trust region/policy collapse - maybe for some algos policy quickly collapses into some pathological form it cannot recover from?\r\n- Action and conseqence spread too far away: PPO in current parametrizations has the longest rollouts. Maybe that helps for the algorithm to correlate actions with rewards that happen much much later, and for other algos it's too far away.\r\n\r\nThese are just my guesses but let me know if you know anything more.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/451903769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MillionIntegrals","id":2262651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MillionIntegrals/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/comments/452773459","html_url":"https://github.com/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/35#issuecomment-452773459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MillionIntegrals/vel/issues/35","id":452773459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mjc3MzQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"yngtodd","id":16848331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ4MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16848331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd","html_url":"https://github.com/yngtodd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yngtodd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-09T17:07:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T17:07:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey MillionIntegrals,\r\n\r\nNo problem at all! I hope you had a great Christmas holiday. \r\n\r\nYou are right, I am plotting the mean and standard deviation over 50 random seeds in that plot. I wasn't thinking about the skew making it look like those rewards were negative. Good call. \r\n\r\nI have been looking into hyperparameter optimization for RL algorithms and have been able to find a could configurations of ACER that work for Enduro. It has been a pretty interesting bit of work. These RL algorithms can be a bit of a handful when you start turning their knobs.
