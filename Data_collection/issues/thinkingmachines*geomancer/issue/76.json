Issue Description\r\nUnable to extract features for a data frame of 56,761 rows if the feature class has a count of around 11,000 in its dataset.\r\n\r\n(Though it works if the feature class has a count of around 5,000 in its dataset, count of around 7,000 works sometimes)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n```python\r\ndf = pd.read_csv('sample.csv')\r\n\r\ninstance_primary = DistanceToNearest(\r\n    'primary',\r\n    source_table = 'project.dataset_id.gis_osm_roads_free_1',\r\n    feature_name = 'dist_primary'\r\n)\r\n\r\ntest_primary = instance_primary.cast(df, dburl = 'bigquery://project')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What's the expected result?\r\n- no error\r\n\r\n### What's the actual result?\r\n- DatabaseError [Link to Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DHav6WD0M8OVwBbq0FYPF7w_Q6-c4xEC?authuser=1#scrollTo=BJqyzrWZIMkl)\r\n\r\n### Additional details /
