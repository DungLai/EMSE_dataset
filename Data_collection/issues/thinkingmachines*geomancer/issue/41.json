ideas:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom geomancer import SpellBook\r\n\r\n# When you want to register spells\r\nmy_spellbook = SpellBook([\r\n  DistanceToNearest(\"embassy\", within=10000, source_table=\"tm-geospatial.ph_osm.pois\"), # From BQ\r\n  DistanceToNearest(\"hospital\", within=5000, source_table=\"pois\"), # From Spatialite\r\n])\r\n\r\n# You can then do multiple

\r\nmy_spellbook.description = \"Some cool features for other stuff\" # optional\r\nmy_spellbook.to_json(\"path/to/my/own/features.json\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome potential challenges:\r\n- It is possible to create a spellbook with spells coming from different warehouses (one feature from BQ, another from SQLite, etc.). However, setting the `source_table` and the `host` is decoupled (one during init, another during `cast()`). \r\n- Concatenating everything inside a dataframe (similar output column names, etc.). We should do some validation before doing concat?\r\n\r\nSome preliminary tasks:\r\n- Write down all possible metadata to include: things that are automatically generated (date? unique ID? etc.) and those that are manually set).","closed_by":{"login":"ljvmiranda921","id":12949683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921","html_url":"https://github.com/ljvmiranda921","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
