now, `on` refers solely to the fclass. In this context, I don't think we need to worry about the `AND` statement since the fclass is mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nIf you make a query on Geofabrik data with a `WHERE` clause that says\r\n\r\n```\r\nWHERE fclass = 'primary' AND fclass = 'secondary'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen you wouldn't get any results because a road that has a `primary` fclass can't also have a `secondary` fclass at the same time.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\nBut if `on` can refer to other columns aside from fclass and if it can accept logical and comparison operators, then I would think it would be nice to be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf = DistanceToNearest(\r\n    on= [\"fclass\", \"is\", \"not\", \"primary\", \"or\", \"fclass\", \"is\", \"secondary\", \"and\", \" distance\", \"less than\", \"1000\"]\r\n    source_table=\"geospatial.ph_osm.gis_osm_roads_free_1\",\r\n    feature_name=\"dist_primary_or_secondary\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWHERE fclass != 'primary' OR fclass = 'secondary' AND distance < 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logical and comparison operators can be reserved keywords for the `on` argument.

`on` can now use columns aside from `fclass` via the `{column}:{filter}` format. So I was thinking of something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbridge:T AND fclass:primary\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour idea of passing iterables is fine. To incorporate the operators I think we can follow something similar to SQLAlchemy, an `or(*args)` and `and(*args)` method: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7942547/using-or-in-sqlalchemy. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport geomancer.filters as f\r\n\r\nDistanceToNearest(\r\n    on = f.and(\"bridge:T\", \"primary\"),  # default is fclass if no filter\r\n    **kwargs\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan also do chaining:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nf.or(\"secondary\", f.and(\"bridge:T\", \"primary\"))\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/comments/481264461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ljvmiranda921","id":12949683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12949683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921","html_url":"https://github.com/ljvmiranda921","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljvmiranda921/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/comments/481493198","html_url":"https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/67#issuecomment-481493198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thinkingmachines/geomancer/issues/67","id":481493198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ5MzE5OA==","user":{"login":"ardieorden","id":17169362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY5MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17169362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden","html_url":"https://github.com/ardieorden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardieorden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T00:58:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T00:58:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cool!
