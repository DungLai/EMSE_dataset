For CenterNet 2D-detection you need three 1/4 tensors. E.g. image: 512, 512, 3 -> hm: 128, 128, 80, reg: 128, 128, 2, wh: 128, 128, 2. You will need a decoder like FPN or DLA to get to 1/4. I think EfficientNet works the same, but I am not familiar with it. The rest can stay the same. Note that I didn't provide training code so you probably won't get far with this repo :)\r\n\r\nUse the official one. Define the network and register it here: https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet/blob/master/src/lib/models/model.py#L16. Good luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/see--/keras-centernet/issues/comments/501608162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"see--","id":11165293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTY1Mjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11165293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--","html_url":"https://github.com/see--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/see--/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/see--/keras-centernet/issues/comments/528073440","html_url":"https://github.com/see--/keras-centernet/issues/5#issuecomment-528073440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/see--/keras-centernet/issues/5","id":528073440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODA3MzQ0MA==","user":{"login":"shreejalt","id":22684229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjg0MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22684229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt","html_url":"https://github.com/shreejalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shreejalt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T20:29:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T20:29:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nI want to implement this centernet algorithm for pose estimation in YOLOv3.
