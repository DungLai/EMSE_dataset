erratum appears in Biochim Biophys Acta 1995 Dec 27;1264(3):409] \r\n... ... Hydroxyurea (HU) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation. In addition, HU stimulates the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia patients. To further understand its mechanism of action, we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of c-jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. HU induced a dose-dependent stimulation of c-jun synthesis. The levels of c-jun mRNA was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by HU within 2 h. This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h. Both nuclear run-on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates c-jun mRNA expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c-jun mRNA. In addition, the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in HU treated cells. Furthermore, concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X AP-1/CAT activity. These results strongly suggest that HU induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of c-jun during erythroid differentiation. \"\"\")\r\n>>> ab.ents\r\nTraceback (most recent call

couple of issues here:\r\n\r\n1. Until 0.2.4, none of the specialised NER models contained the full pipeline. I didn't add it in because it fits with spacy's naming convention `{lang}_{model}_{data}_{size}`. It's not really a problem that 0.2.4 contains them (just a miscommunication between Daniel and I), and maybe it's actually a good thing given this problem.\r\n\r\n2. https://support.prodi.gy/t/error-assigning-label-id-when-combining-custom-ner-model-from-prodigy-with-spacy-dependency-parsing-model/1444/2 This seems to be a similar problem. Basically what I think is happening is that spacy assumes that all NER labels are in the vocabulary - here they are not, because the vocabs are different. You might find that just adding the literal strings the NER model needs for its labels to the vocabulary of the one for the parser/tagger works.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/562793244/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/562793754","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/186#issuecomment-562793754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/186","id":562793754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjc5Mzc1NA==","user":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T00:40:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T00:40:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Also, I should have used the base vocab from the medium pipeline when training these specialised NER models, meaning that the NER vocab should be strictly larger (as it contains only the additional labels), although I am not confident that is the case - it's possible spacy adds tokens it sees during training on the fly to the vocab or something that I don't know about.

you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/562800661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2863188536,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg2MzE4ODUzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2863188536","actor":{"login":"masonedmison","id":36715397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzE1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36715397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison","html_url":"https://github.com/masonedmison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-07T01:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2863188537,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NjMxODg1Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2863188537","actor":{"login":"masonedmison","id":36715397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzE1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36715397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison","html_url":"https://github.com/masonedmison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-07T01:33:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/562893748","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/186#issuecomment-562893748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/186","id":562893748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjg5Mzc0OA==","user":{"login":"masonedmison","id":36715397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzE1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36715397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison","html_url":"https://github.com/masonedmison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masonedmison/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T22:51:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T22:51:32Z","author_associatio

I just ended up manually moving over the vocab file to the `sci_md` model, then adding the `ner` pipe for the `ner` module, then use the `spacy.Language.to_disk` to save the full pipeline with the specialized `ner`. Not the most pretty process, but only needs done once and it seems to work as expected. Thanks for all of your time and help!
