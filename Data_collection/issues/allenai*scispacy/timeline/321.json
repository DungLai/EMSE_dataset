Entities can be multiple words in general. The entity boundaries should line up with tokens though. So, \"New York City\" might be an entity, but composed of three tokens, \"New\", \"York\", and \"City\". If you want a vector for \"New York City\", one way to do this is to average the individual token vectors. I do not know if this would work well for your use case, but it is a common thing to do.\r\n2) From the \"Tokens\" output, it looks like you are passing a long list of strings to the model.
