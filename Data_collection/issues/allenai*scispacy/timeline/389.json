The entire training process is run using the spacy projects (https://spacy.io/usage/projects) configuration system. So the hard part of all of this is getting datasets for POS tagging, dependency parsing, and NER in whatever language you are interested in. If you have those datasets, you should be able to replace our training files with your training files and mostly just run our `project.yml`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/896365503/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5138234430,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTEzODIzNDQzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/5138234430","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-10T22:57:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
