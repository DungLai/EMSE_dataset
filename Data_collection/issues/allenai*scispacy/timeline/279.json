Broadly this seems like a good approach. Also, there is an element of non-determinism in using statistical models, so they are never going to be perfect. However, there are a couple of things you might want to try:\r\n\r\n - https://github.com/allenai/scispacy#entitylinker Currently you are using the UMLS entity linker. You might want to try either the MESH or HPO linkers, as these are less noisy (because they have fewer concepts and are more tightly controlled).\r\n\r\n- The data the entity linker was trained on contains verbs which can be linked. In your case, diseases and treatments are very unlikely to be verbs, so I would suggest filtering them out. \r\n\r\n- Finally, you might try to filter the entities you extract based on some sentence level keywords. E.g if \"treated\" or \"patient\" is in the sentence, you can be a little more aggressive in your extractions, perhaps expanding to noun phrases etc.\r\n\r\nHopefully these ideas will give your method a boost!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/710163031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3887181982,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4NzE4MTk4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3887181982","actor":{"login":"predestination","id":10020953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10020953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination","html_url":"https://github.com/predestination","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T16:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3887181986,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODcxODE5ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3887181986","actor":{"login":"predestination","id":10020953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10020953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination","html_url":"https://github.com/predestination","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T16:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/711131661","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/279#issuecomment-711131661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/279","id":711131661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTEzMTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"predestination","id":10020953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10020953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination","html_url":"https://github.com/predestination","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/predestination/received_events","type":"User","site_ad
