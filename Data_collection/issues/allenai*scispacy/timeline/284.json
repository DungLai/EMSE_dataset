In your colab, the instance is not installing the right nmslib package. The entity linker uses nmslib, an approximate nearest neighbour library to do sparse nearest neighbour search over tf-idf vectors for entities. I don't entirely understand why but colab is not installing a version of nmslib which is compiled to use the features of the CPU that the colab clearly has. If you look in the colab logs, you will see this:\r\n\r\n`Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2`\r\n\r\nWhen I run that benchmark on my macbook, I get a 2x (3.1s) slowdown from using the linker, not an 8x slowdown, but it is correctly using all the instruction sets apart from AVX2.\r\n\r\n2. The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search.\r\n\r\n3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s.\r\n\r\n4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, we set this parameter to `200`. You can change this value to speed up the search substantially, for a small ish cost in recall:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L204\r\n\r\nLet me know if that's helpful!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/718151109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3932967977,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkzMjk2Nzk3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3932967977","actor":{"login":"JohnGiorgi","id":8917831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTc4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8917831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnGiorgi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T19:13:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3932967980,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MzI5Njc5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3932967980","actor":{"login":"JohnGiorgi","id":8917831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTc4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8917831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnGiorgi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T19:13:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/718824201","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/284#issuecomment-718824201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/284","id":718824201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODgyNDIwMQ==","user":{"login":"JohnGiorgi","id":8917831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTc4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8917831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnGiorgi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnGiorgi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T15:20:02Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T15:20:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DeNeutoy

Classify the K retrieved documents into positive and negative examples using a `MatchingStrategy` (exact match, MetaMap match, SciSpacy match, ...)\r\n\r\nImplementation should be modular, so we can easily experiment with the different setups (preprocessing, retriever model and matching strategy).\r\n","creator":{"login":"vlievin","id":9859840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin","html_url":"https://github.com/vlievin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":43,"state":"open","created_at":"2021-06-28T11:22:34Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:52:48Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2021-10-11T07:36:56Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T09:30:57Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T09:30:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"repository":{"id":372446378,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzI0NDYzNzg=","name":"vod","full_name":"VodLM/vod","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VodLM","id":122369261,"node_id":"O_kgDOB0s07Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122369261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM","html_url":"https://github.com/VodLM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VodLM/vod","description":"Variational Open-Domain -
