We found that including the segmentation rules (1) was not as necessary with the retrained parser (2) decreased the processing speed of the model and (3) sometimes hurt parser performance a bit. For the sentence splitting issues, the custom sentence segmentation rules that we wrote can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/custom_sentence_segmenter.py), and they can be added to a model that you have loaded like so\r\n```\r\n    from spacy.language import Language\r\n    from scispacy.custom_sentence_segmenter import combined_rule_sentence_segmenter\r\n\r\n    Language.factories['combined_rule_sentence_segmenter'] = lambda nlp, **cfg: combined_rule_sentence_segmenter\t\r\n    nlp.add_pipe(nlp.create_pipe('combined_rule_sentence_segmenter'), first=True)\r\n```\r\nYou can also easily add your own rules to this function if you find that existing rules don't cover the segmentation errors that you are seeing. This may have side effects on the parser, but we have not thoroughly experimented with that.\r\n\r\nThe tokenization issues (I think of your examples it is just this one \"p65.c-Rel\" / \"p50-.c-Rel\") might be more complicated to fix because the tokenizer is a complex set of regular expressions. However, one thing you could try is, after creating a doc using `en_core_sci_md`, post process the doc (or add your own pipe similarly to the sentence segmenter pipe) and make use of [Span.merge](https://spacy.io/api/span#merge) to merge tokens that you think should be one token.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/486363196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2731411337,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3MzE0MTEzMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2731411337","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"144fb4100ac5743195cf2898336d584588b787c9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dakinggg/scispacy/commits/144fb4100ac5743195cf2898336d584588b787c9","created_at":"2019-10-21T22:04:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T22:05:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T22:05:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/172","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/172/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/172/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/172/events","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/172","id":510319710,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzMwNzE1MDI5","number":172,"title":"Add
