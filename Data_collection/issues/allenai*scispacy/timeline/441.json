Basically its matching the opening paren before TR against the closing paren after RMR, and taking everything in between as a candidate long form, and then `receptor` before `(TR)` happens to be an acceptable short form for the long form `receptor (RMR`. Any longer distance between the two parens would have been filtered out, and if `receptor` didn't happen to match the other `receptor` it also wouldn't have gotten through, this was right on the edge. Probably we should check and make sure that the parens inside the candidate aren't unbalanced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/1188627554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/1189029783","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/441#issuecomment-1189029783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/441","id":1189029783,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPNzOc5G3yeX","user":{"login":"mpetruc","id":5605207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5605207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc","html_url":"https://github.com/mpetruc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpetruc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T13:06:07Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T13:06:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much for the quick and thoughtful response.
