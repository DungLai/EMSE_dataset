I meant `ORGANISM`, however this entity type is called `SPECIES` in other corpora.

\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I found such issues (with two entities that occur consecutively) in several other cases, e.g.\r\n\r\n- In this work, we show that an 11-amino acid peptide derived from the second

@mariosaenger thanks for the additional info.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is an annotation design in the original data which is a bit unfortunate:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cambridgeltl/MTL-Bioinformatics-2016/blob/master/data/BioNLP13CG-IOB/train.tsv#L2167\r\n\r\n\r\nIt annotates noun modifiers here as separate entities, which in some cases can be correct, but makes using a practical NER model substantially harder. For example in the line linked above, I don't really think that \"human\" refers to an entity - it's being used in an abstract sense, to modify the cell type. The word \"human\" in this sentence has no agency. \r\n\r\nNot only is this kind of dubious annotation, but it is also inconsistent:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cambridgeltl/MTL-Bioinformatics-2016/blob/master/data/BioNLP13CG-IOB/train.tsv#L2450\r\n\r\nHere only _some_ of the noun modifiers are included in the entity. For me this is pretty damning and likely the reason that the F1 performance on this dataset is not that high.\r\n\r\nEven within this phenomena of annotating organism modifiers as entities, it is done inconsistently: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cambridgeltl/MTL-Bioinformatics-2016/blob/master/data/BioNLP13CG-IOB/train.tsv#L7570\r\n\r\nhere, it's pretty hard to argue that \"amphibian\" shouldn't also be an ORGANISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is actually quite interesting, but it's kind of tricky to fix without a bit of effort cleaning up the training data. However, that's probably not too difficult, to go through and filter entity boundaries which are modifiers or something.
