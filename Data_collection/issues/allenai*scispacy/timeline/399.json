- Dynamic dataset generation","description":"The previous experiments rely on the FZxMedQA dataset: a static mapping between the the MedQA questions and the FZ articles based on the MetaMap matching. This Milestone aims at generating this mapping dynamically. \r\n\r\nThe dynamic data generation pipeline will be implemented in the Corpus object. The corpus object will process the data following 3 steps:\r\n1. Chunking a large corpus of N documents into M>N chunks of equal size, optional preprocessing steps (e.g. appending the title of the documents, or appending the most frequent medical terms within the surrounding text) will be implemented.\r\n2. For each question:\r\n    a. Retrieve K relevant documents based on a `Retriever` model (Dense, ElasticSearch, Colbert)\r\n    b. Classify the K retrieved documents into positive and negative examples using a `MatchingStrategy` (exact match, MetaMap match, SciSpacy match, ...)\r\n\r\nImplementation should be modular, so we can easily experiment with the different setups (preprocessing, retriever model and matching strategy).\r\n","creator":{"login":"vlievin","id":9859840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin","html_url":"https://github.com/vlievin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlievin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":43,"state":"open","created_at":"2021-06-28T11:22:34Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T10:52:48Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2021-10-06T15:21:32Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T11:49:59Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T11:49:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"repository":{"id":372446378,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzI0NDYzNzg=","name":"vod","full_name":"VodLM/vod","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VodLM","id":122369261,"node_id":"O_kgDOB0s07Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122369261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM","html_url":"https://github.com/VodLM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VodLM/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VodLM/vod","description":"Variational Open-Domain -
