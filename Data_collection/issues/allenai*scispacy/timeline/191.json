It is all of the possible alias names for all entities.\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L314\r\n\r\nLater on, when it is used, we do ann lookup in \"alias space\", and then return all canonical entities that have this alias.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L253\r\n\r\nThe reason we do it in this slightly backward way (matching aliases, and then finding entities which have them as an alias) is explained in this comment here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L94\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps! Let me know if you have any questions. Certainly I think the alias list is inefficient in some way, but it works for now

to your advice(#191), I can reproduce K-recall curve on Medmentions dev data.\r\nHere I set efS=2000 because my interest is linking rather than time

of Figure 3 in the original [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-5034/).\r\nIn paper, unsupervised abbreviation detection and expansion is conducted before ANN search.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation is, before ANN search, \r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/umls_linking.py#L80\r\nis conducted for all mentions, given documents in which mention exists, and then if mention is seen as abbreviation, longer candidate form is used for ANN search. I'm now trying to incorporate this function before ANN search.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my question is whether this interpretation is correct or not. Also, if there is anything crucial to reproduce this char 3gram + Abb.,  I'd appreciate it if you'd write.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
