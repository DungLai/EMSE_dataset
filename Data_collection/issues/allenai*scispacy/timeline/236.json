Most of these look like tokenization errors, leading to misclassification. Some of them also look like reasonable entities to me also. If you can consistently recognise an issue with the tokenization, you can add exceptions to the spacy tokenizer, or re-tokenize after the fact to fix them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/638323488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3403127292,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQwMzEyNzI5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3403127292","actor":{"login":"iacopy","id":4771794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzE3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4771794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy","html_url":"https://github.com/iacopy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T16:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3403127298,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MDMxMjcyOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3403127298","actor":{"login":"iacopy","id":4771794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzE3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4771794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy","html_url":"https://github.com/iacopy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iacopy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T16:54:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/638327331","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/236#issuecomment-638327331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/236","id":638327331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODMyNzMzMQ==","user":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T17:01:15Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T17:01:15Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yeah, I remember I had some code in the tokenizer to deal with parentheses a bit better, but at some point spacy changed from the `regex` package to the `re` package, and that code required variable width lookbehinds, which re does not support, so it was commented out. Not sure thats the entirety of the problem, but given how many of these have unbalanced parens, i think it is part of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/638327331/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7335024351,"node_id":"LE_lADOCPNzOc4lf4UvzwAAAAG1M5bf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/7335024351","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T02:55:49Z","label":{"name":"model improvement","color":"f9d0c4"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
