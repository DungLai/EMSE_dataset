Unfortunately, one of the downsides of using a trained model is that it is sometimes wrong. I would have to dig into the data further to see if there might be something weird going on with the annotations for arm specifically or not. \r\n\r\nIf there are a small number of specific cases that would be useful to fix for your dataset/task, you may want to check out spaCy's [Entity Ruler](https://spacy.io/api/entityruler). This would allow you to write rules for entity identification, for which you could ensure their correctness. You could also potentially try further training the NER model with labeled cases that match the mistakes you see, as described here: https://spacy.io/usage/training#ner. Otherwise, unfortunately mistakes are part of any trained model. You can see this thread on spaCy for their discussion of this topic as well: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3052. Thanks again for your interest in this library!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/493220591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/500260722","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/116#issuecomment-500260722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/116","id":500260722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDI2MDcyMg==","user":{"login":"rgtlai","id":199758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai","html_url":"https://github.com/rgtlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgtlai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T01:02:22Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T01:02:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@danielkingai2, Thank you.
