had a question (https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/136) in scispacy regarding the usage of `is_oov`, which then confused me:\r\n\r\nHow should the `is_oov` flag be used? Initially, I thought it would correspond to tokens which do not have a vector, but it seems like it should correspond to existence in the `nlp.vocab`, given this line: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/init_model.py#L142\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [28]: x = spacy.load(\"en_core_sci_sm\")\r\n\r\nIn [29]: doc = x(\"hello this word smelling is oov.\")\r\n\r\nIn [30]: [t.is_oov for t in doc]\r\nOut[30]: [True, False, False, True, False, True, False]\r\n\r\nIn [31]: x = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\r\n\r\nIn [32]: doc = x(\"hello this word smelling is oov.\")\r\n\r\nIn [33]: [t.is_oov for t in doc]\r\nOut[33]: [True, True, True, True, True, True, True]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've seen previously in #3986 that this was an issue from v2.0, so I double checked that the model is fresh:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [36]: x.meta\r\nOut[36]:\r\n{'accuracy': {'ents_f': 85.8587845242,\r\n  'ents_p': 86.3317889027,\r\n  'ents_r': 85.3909350025,\r\n  'las': 89.6616629074,\r\n  'tags_acc': 96.7783856079,\r\n  'token_acc': 99.0697323163,\r\n  'uas': 91.5287392082},\r\n 'author': 'Explosion AI',\r\n 'description': 'English multi-task CNN trained on OntoNotes.
