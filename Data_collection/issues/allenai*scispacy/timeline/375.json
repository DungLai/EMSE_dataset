An off the cuff guess is that something in spacy-transformers assumes that each token is less than 512 characters without checking. if it is not too hard, you could try preprocessing your data to make sure those really long tokens don't exist (just throw some space in the middle, or remove them, because it is pretty unlikely that spacy/scispacy are going to do anything reasonable with some long latex string)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/878668163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/879211153","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/375#issuecomment-879211153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/375","id":879211153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3OTIxMTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"juhai","id":3169147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai","html_url":"https://github.com/juhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-13T16:01:23Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T16:01:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, the real data isn't this bad.
