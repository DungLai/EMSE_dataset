One is the Named Entity Recognition (NER) component, which identifies textual spans that are likely to be entities (and depending on which scipsacy model, also their broad type). This information can be accessed as you've done via `doc.ents` and `doc.ents[0].ent_type_`. The second is the Entity Linking component, which is the one you specify mesh/hpo for. That component takes in the textual spans selected by the NER component and attempts to link them to an entity from the knowledge base. That information can be accessed via `doc.ents[0]._.kb_ents`. Hope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/1366188573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/1366939277","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/463#issuecomment-1366939277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/463","id":1366939277,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPNzOc5RedaN","user":{"login":"almogmor","id":50709552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzA5NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50709552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor","html_url":"https://github.com/almogmor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almogmor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-28T21:55:37Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T21:55:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
