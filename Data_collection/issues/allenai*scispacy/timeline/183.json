You could try to use NER combined with the dependency parser to extract some relations perhaps. You could check out the spacy pretrain command (https://spacy.io/api/cli#pretrain) perhaps for combining pretrained weights with spacy. Your questions might be better suited for the spacy folks (https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) or the biobert folks (https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert) depending on your goals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/562380589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2872533470,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg3MjUzMzQ3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2872533470","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-11T00:24:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/864579030","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/183#issuecomment-864579030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/183","id":864579030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDU3OTAzMA==","user":{"login":"youssef-snoussi","id":69009221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDA5MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69009221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi","html_url":"https://github.com/youssef-snoussi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youssef-snoussi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-20T16:26:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T16:26:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello
