To do this you'd need a copy of UMLS yourself, which you could then extract these relations from. \r\n\r\nOne idea as an approximation to this would be to group all the concepts which share any aliases? This might give you reasonable groupings, maybe.\r\n\r\n(also if you describe your objective at a higher level, we might have suggestions for alternative methods which would be easier/more effective)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/670600713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3633919495,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYzMzkxOTQ5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3633919495","actor":{"login":"maxfarrell","id":6461738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjE3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6461738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/maxfarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T16:28:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3633919499,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MzM5MTk0OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3633919499","actor":{"login":"maxfarrell","id":6461738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjE3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6461738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/maxfarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfarrell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T16:28:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/718841774","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/259#issuecomment-718841774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/259","id":718841774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODg0MTc3NA==","user":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T15:46:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T15:46:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closing
