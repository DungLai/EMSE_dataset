This will be different between spacy and scispacy, because the parser, tagger, and NER are trained on biomedical data in scispacy.\r\n\r\nFor the medium and large models, the spacy vectors are trained on Ontonotes (general domain web data), and the scispacy vectors are trained on pubmed papers (academic, biomedical data). So there will also be a difference for these models. Which to use probably depends on your use case, and I haven't played with the similarity function much myself, but my example shows about how I would expect it to go. That is, \"tylenol\" and \"ibuprofen\" are more similar according to scispacy vectors than spacy vectors, but the full sentence is scored to be more similar by spacy than scispacy, maybe because the spacy vectors are better at similarity of \"normal\" text. This part is mostly I guess, but I hope that answers your question!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/843610313/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4763338342,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc2MzMzODM0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4763338342","actor":{"login":"MichalMalyska","id":12971408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTcxNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12971408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska","html_url":"https://github.com/MichalMalyska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-18T22:30:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4763338345,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NjMzMzgzNDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4763338345","actor":{"login":"MichalMalyska","id":12971408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTcxNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12971408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska","html_url":"https://github.com/MichalMalyska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-18T22:30:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4900672406,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDkwMDY3MjQwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4900672406","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-16T22:12:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/991792542","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/s
