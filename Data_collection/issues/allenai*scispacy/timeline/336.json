I should check and update that.\r\n2/3/4) First, this is a model, so inconsistent and surprising output is likely, and some memorization is likely (@DeNeutoy looks like data augmentation could help a lot here). Second, the BC5CDR corpus was annotated with specific guidelines (https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/media/store/files/2015/bc5_CDR_data_guidelines.pdf) which you may want to read  and see if they align with your expectations of what would be annotated as a chemical. Here is some output of a mix of real and made up chemical names. I don't really conclude anything from this, other than that the model is definitely using some combination of the form of the name itself and the context\r\n```\r\nIn [29]: for drug_name in [\"mesna\", \"remdesivir\", \"mebane\", \"relidate\", \"novila\", \"aspirin\", \"coloxal\", \"inovivir\", \"scopolamine\", \"entamine\", \"valimine\", \"henirin\", \"noonirin\", \"halirin\"]:\r\n    ...:     text = f\"The drug {drug_name} is used to treat the virus\"\r\n    ...:     doc = nlp(text)\r\n    ...:     print(doc.ents)\r\n    ...: \r\n(mesna,)\r\n()\r\n(mebane,)\r\n()\r\n()\r\n(aspirin,)\r\n()\r\n()\r\n(scopolamine,)\r\n(entamine,)\r\n(valimine,)\r\n(henirin,)\r\n()\r\n()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like it is also sensitive to capitalization\r\n```\r\nIn [56]: doc = nlp(\"Remdesivir is a chemical\")\r\nIn [57]: doc.ents\r\nOut[57]: (Remdesivir,)\r\n\r\nIn [58]: doc = nlp(\"remdesivir is a chemical\")\r\n\r\nIn [59]: doc.ents\r\nOut[59]: ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't have much else to add at the moment. We were thinking about running some data augmentation experiments to try to improve the NER, but haven't done it yet (I'd be thrilled to have a contribution along those lines).\r\n5) Definitely the model takes into account the context that the word occurs in, so it is not wholly surprising to me that the same word could be classified differently in different contexts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/800691659/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4467434301,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2NzQzNDMwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4467434301","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T00:00:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4467434305,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0Njc0MzQzMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4467434305","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T00:00:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4499750236,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDQ5OTc1MDIzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4499750236","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-24T04:50:58Z","rename":{"from":"Expectations
