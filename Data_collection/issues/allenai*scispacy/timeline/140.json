- i'd love your opinion here.\r\n\r\nScispacy's NER data is separate from the tagging and parsing data. Because of this, we train first a pipeline with a tagger and parser, and then use [this script](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/train_ner.py) to add in an NER pipe.\r\n\r\nWe didn't notice this until now, but when we upgraded from `spacy==2.0.18` to `spacy==2.1`, we observed that after training the NER model, the Labelled Attachment Score of the parser is dropping by about 4%. I think this might be related to the 2.1 release sharing more weights between the parser and NER models - is that right?\r\n\r\nA couple of investigations we've done:\r\n\r\n- It's not due to a newer spacy version than 2.1.0, the same reported results occur consistently across 2.1.x versions\r\n- The amount of training for NER doesn't affect how much the LAS drops off one epoch is the same reduction as N. This made me wonder if we needed to preserve the optimizer state somehow when we reload the previous pipeline with the tagger and parser in it?\r\n- Additionally, just adding the NER pipe, calling `nlp.begin_training()` and writing the new model to disk results in the same decrease in LAS performance.\r\n- Before 2.1, the LAS doesn't change after we train the NER model\r\n\r\nIt's also a bit weird to me that it's only the LAS that's affected, rather than the whole parser.\r\n\r\nIt's reasonable if the answer to this is \"they need to be trained together\". We've been thinking of using a strong BERT model trained on med mentions to annotate generic mention spans in the GENIA corpus anyway, so it's possible that we can just accelerate this.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/519189466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2540812407,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU0MDgxMjQwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2540812407","actor":{"login":"honnibal","id":8059750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTk3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8059750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal","html_url":"https://github.com/honnibal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-07T17:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2540812408,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NDA4MTI0MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2540812408","actor":{"login":"honnibal","id":8059750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTk3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8059750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal","html_url":"https://github.com/honnibal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honnibal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-07T17:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T19:00:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T19:00:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/sci
