Yes, this documentation is out of date, thank you!\r\n2. We do have a paper, although it may or may not answer your question (https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ScispaCy%3A-Fast-and-Robust-Models-for-Biomedical-Neumann-King/de28ec1d7bd38c8fc4e8ac59b6133800818b4e29). Figure 3 shows the recall curve as we increase the number of candidates with our candidate generator. We did not dive into what remains in that last bit of recall and whether word embeddings could help. The paper we compare against (https://aclanthology.org/P18-1010.pdf) uses a different string similarity measure for the candidate generation. Character trigram similarity is a pretty common string similarity measure, which is why we choose to use it. The intention is really that a further entity linker that takes into account the context of the mention rather than just the mention string itself should be used. If I were going to experiment, I would probably start by experimenting with reranking the candidates we generate to increase precision, rather than improving the candidate generator to increase recall.\r\n3. Sorry, I don't really remember the compute profile of creating the index. We use nmslib (https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) though, so you might be able to find some more information there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/918456817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/918516493","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/394#issuecomment-918516493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/394","id":918516493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPNzOc42v3MN","user":{"login":"MichalMalyska","id":12971408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTcxNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12971408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska","html_url":"https://github.com/MichalMalyska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichalMalyska/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-13T19:40:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T19:40:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have trained a couple of my own versions of linkers and plugged into scispacy:\r\n\r\n2) the 3-char works surprisingly well, with one exception (on my usecases), because \"ing\" is 3 chars, it makes quite a significant difference between \"bleed\" and \"bleeding\" etc. \r\n\r\n3) I created an index on an i7 processor for an ontology with the size of ~120k, and it took ~1h total, so for larger ontologies (especially if you decide to go with word vectors which are not sparse) you definitely need something beefier.
