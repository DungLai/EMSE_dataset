None of the scispacy or spacy models (that I am aware of) are trained on tweets, and so there might be some challenges off the bat. One idea that comes to mind is to compare the average probability of the words in the tweet between the scispacy model (which comes from pubmed papers) and the spacy model (which comes from web text). I don't know how well this will work on short tweets, but here is an example of it working. I picked a random sentence from a medical paper, and you can see that scispacy assigns it higher probability than the spacy model does. It is log probabilities with a min value of -20. If you do the same procedure for the above tweet, both scispacy and spacy assign it the same probability, so you may be able to look for tweets that scispacy assigns higher probability than spacy does. I'm not sure how accurate this filter will be.\r\n```In [21]: nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')\r\n\r\nIn [22]: nlp_sci = spacy.load('en_core_sci_md')\r\n\r\nIn [23]: doc = nlp(\"Improved
