@BlakeList,\r\n\r\nCreating your own entity linker is quite straightforward - there is one fiddly bit in how the linkers are registered with scispacy at the moment which is less than ideal, but you should be able to follow the instructions in this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use this script: \r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/create_linker.py\r\n\r\nto create the files for the linker. The only input you need is a json/jsonl file with objects which look like this class:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/4ade4ec897fa48c2ecf3187caa08a949920d126d/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L12\r\n\r\nOnce you've generated the linker and tested it out, we can see about getting it integrated into scispacy, if you think it would be

@DeNeutoy,\r\n\r\nSorry for the slow response, I am currently going down an alternative route.\r\nI have instead built an entity-ruler (and now an ner model using prodigy + spacy). The code above is quite straightforward, however, I was having some troubles understanding how ontology classes can be used with the umls format.\r\n\r\nIs there a standard approach to convert between ontology rdfs to umls? Can ontology classes (e.g. TO:0000387 for plant trait) be used as the concept id?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBlake","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/807919502/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BlakeList","id":24213472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjEzNDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24213472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList","html_url":"https://github.com/BlakeList","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeList/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4511649868,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDUxMTY0OTg2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4511649868","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T04:03:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4511649870,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1MTE2NDk4NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/4511649870","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T04:03:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-10T00:20:25Z","updated_at":"2021-04-10T00:20:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/346","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/346/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/346/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/346/events","html_url":"

I use [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) as a single go-to ontology, and it would be awesome to have Wikidata integration in the EntityLinker in sciSpacy.

Wikidata has +100M concepts, but only a fraction are relevant. It would already be super cool to have the 6.2M that are linked to English Wikipedia.  \r\n\r\nIf there is something in the side of Wikidata that could be useful (e.g. making some subset of terms),

I read several previous discussions about adding a custom KB to scispacy instead of using the preset ones and a helpful discussion I found was in: #331 and #237.\r\n\r\nI followed the steps and I managed to run the script with my jsonl and managed to get some outputs (4 specifically) but I am not quite clear how to proceed from here.\r\n\r\nHere is my code (I ran on jupyter notebook):\r\n```\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import (\r\n    CandidateGenerator,\r\n    LinkerPaths\r\n)\r\nfrom scispacy.linking_utils import KnowledgeBase\r\nimport spacy\r\n\r\nCustomLinkerPaths_mycustom = LinkerPaths(\r\n    ann_index=\"output/nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectorizer=\"output//nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectors=\"output/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib\",\r\n    concept_aliases_list=\"output/concept_aliases.json\",\r\n)\r\nclass myKnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        file_path: str = \"custom_kb.jsonl\",\r\n    ):\r\n        super().__init__(file_path)\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_PATHS[\"myCustom\"] = CustomLinkerPaths_mycustom\r\nDEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[\"myCustom\"] = myKnowledgeBase\r\n\r\n\r\nnlp = spacy.load(\"new_model\")\r\nnlp.add_pipe(\"scispacy_linker\", config={\"resolve_abbreviations\": True, \"linker_name\": \"myCustom\"})\r\n```\r\n This gave me the error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: [E002] Can't find factory for 'scispacy_linker' for language English (en). This usually happens when spaCy calls `nlp.create_pipe` with a custom component name that's not registered on the current language class. If you're using a Transformer, make sure to install 'spacy-transformers'. If you're using a custom component, make sure you've added the decorator `@Language.component` (for function components) or `@Language.factory` (for class components).\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering how I should do this. From my understanding, we would like to add this new `linker_name` and its paths to the scispacy EntityLinker class but is there a way to do it from importing the scispacy from pip install. Or is the only method to clone the scispacy repository and edit the EntityLinker file?\r\n\r\nIs my understanding right? Any help would be appreciated.

was wondering if you all had any thoughts on developments in the python ecosystem for entity linking since the original 2019 ScispaCy paper.  I see a number of comparisons in it to MetaMap, some of the early code on adding native entity linking (https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/72, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/88), and then lots of more recent requests for extensions to linking like https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/428, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/346, and https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/331 which all got me curious as to whether or not you all are aware of or have potentially considered other methods/libraries for NEN.  [Gilda](https://github.com/indralab/gilda) ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.459803v1)) is one we've been experimenting with since its dependencies are relatively light and its offline execution time is definitely good enough for high-throughput NER + NEN pipelines.  The sources/ontologies covered by it include a number that make a useful complement to what's supported in ScispaCy:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"508\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-14 at 7 23 03 PM\"

methodological differences between it and what you all have done, but I am curious if you all are watching other projects like this and considering either integrating them or pointing users at them if they are looking for support over more nomenclatures/ontologies.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any insight here and for all the work you've done on this

what I know from my research is that the MeSH system doesn't have genetic diseases. That’s why any “complete” disease ontology that uses MeSH will also use OMIM.\r\nMy question is: Is there any way to do this with scispacy? Like any way to use both systems for a piece of text so that what MeSH misses OMIM covers.\r\n\r\nThey also have this thing in the NCBI dataset (disease annotated dataset), so for diseases that do not have any id in MeSH they have used the OMIM system for it.
