Until now, I have used the abbreviation feature and UMLS linker\nfeature. I assume native spacy do not have UMLS linker, and this is\nprecisely my motivation for asking the above question. What are the bionlp\nspecific use cases sci-spacy can currently handle which are not available\nin native spacy? Because there are only two examples it is hard to realize\nthe full potential of sci-spacy.\nI attempted the examples on github-repo page and was able to replicate the\nresults so no issues there.\nI believe that sci-spacy can do a good name-entity recognition specific to\nbiomedical domains though I have yet to test it myself. However, I wonder\ncan I use it to pre-process text to remove biomedical stopwords, or\ngenerate word embeddings. I am not saying I request these features if not\navailable but it would be great to have an understanding of the full extent\nof capabilities of sci-spacy especially for users who are new to BioNLP\nsuch as myself.\n\nThank you for your reply and also for developing sci-spacy in first place!\n\nWarm regards,\nVarshit Dusad\n\nOn Tue, Aug 6, 2019 at 10:41 PM Mark Neumann <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi!\n>\n> Thanks for your interest in the project.\n>\n> Currently you can use scispacy in the same way as other spacy models, so\n> you can look at the spacy tutorials and the core pipelines should work in\n> exactly the same way.\n>\n> If you have any specifics that you found hard to get started with, we\n> could definitely write some tutorials for the non-standard parts of the\n> library.
