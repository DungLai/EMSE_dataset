The only difference is the vocabulary, which makes a slight difference but is basically negligible. \r\n\r\nYou're also right that you probably won't get much benefit from training on top of another NER model that has different types. I would suggest you look at tools like prodigy (Spacy's very nice annotation tool) to help you create a dataset for your task. It's a little hard to give suggestions as I'm not sure what problem you are working on - if you describe it in more detail we might be able to give you more precise advice. E.g for biomed, we have quite a few entity linkers which might do what you need?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/713686135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3904749530,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkwNDc0OTUzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3904749530","actor":{"login":"wpan5","id":61103154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTAzMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61103154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5","html_url":"https://github.com/wpan5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:07:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3904749538,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MDQ3NDk1Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3904749538","actor":{"login":"wpan5","id":61103154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTAzMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61103154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5","html_url":"https://github.com/wpan5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:07:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/715387507","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/281#issuecomment-715387507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/281","id":715387507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTM4NzUwNw==","user":{"login":"wpan5","id":61103154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTAzMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61103154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5","html_url":"https://github.com/wpan5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wpan5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T14:46:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T14:46:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Mark,\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification and suggestions.
