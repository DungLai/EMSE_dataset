Also note that the scispacy med model only has 20k vectors, which is not a huge amount, so many words will be OOV (i.e not have a vector). Is a large model (~2GB with vectors) something that you would be interested in?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/514807640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/515078217","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/138#issuecomment-515078217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/138","id":515078217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTA3ODIxNw==","user":{"login":"meaningfromdata","id":32514781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTE0Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32514781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata","html_url":"https://github.com/meaningfromdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meaningfromdata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T14:56:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T14:56:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for reply.
