I am not sure where the DBpedia based dataset mentioned in that paper is, but it seems your goal is to train an NER model to recognize mentions of entities that are in Wikipedia? If so, you might be able to find some datasets just by searching around, for example I found this which looks like it might be what you are after (https://github.com/ghaddarAbs/WiNER). Once you have the data you want to train on, you just need to get it into a format that spacy accepts (https://spacy.io/api/annotation#training) and then train spacy's ner model (https://spacy.io/usage/training#ner).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/588473979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3053735931,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA1MzczNTkzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3053735931","actor":{"login":"amulyahwr","id":32422474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDIyNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32422474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr","html_url":"https://github.com/amulyahwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amulyahwr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-19T22:57:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
