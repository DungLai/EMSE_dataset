We actually figured out this was a combination of two problems:\r\n\r\n1. We filter for entities which have definitions in the KnowledgeBase, because over 80% of mentions typically should prefer an entity with a definition. However, it was a bit dumb to filter these out when there is an exact string match, so I fixed this part in #153.\r\n\r\n2. The second part is that if the mention detector goes a bit wrong and splits up a long entity into several separate ones, we should be able to use the abbreviation detector to fix those cases.

We actually figured out this was a combination of two problems:\r\n\r\n  1.  We filter for entities which have definitions in the KnowledgeBase, because over 80% of mentions typically should prefer an entity with a definition. However, it was a bit dumb to filter these out when there is an exact string match, so I fixed this part in #153<https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/153>.\r\n  2.  The second part is that if the mention detector goes a bit wrong and splits up a long entity into several separate ones, we should be able to use the abbreviation detector to fix those cases.
