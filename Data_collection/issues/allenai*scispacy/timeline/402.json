Furthermore, the current solution is very memory intensive (RAM usage spikes at 8GB RAM when running the above example).\r\n\r\nTwo ideas for improvement are:\r\n1. `pyarrow` to store the alias list \r\n2. `faiss` to improve upon the current nearest neighbour search (at least in terms of speed)?\r\n\r\nThose are only suggestion as I don't know enough about the inner working of `scipacy`. Regarding my project, this issue is not critical, but that might be a nice improvement for the library.
