was wondering if you all had any thoughts on developments in the python ecosystem for entity linking since the original 2019 ScispaCy paper.  I see a number of comparisons in it to MetaMap, some of the early code on adding native entity linking (https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/72, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/88), and then lots of more recent requests for extensions to linking like https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/428, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/346, and https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/331 which all got me curious as to whether or not you all are aware of or have potentially considered other methods/libraries for NEN.  [Gilda](https://github.com/indralab/gilda) ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.459803v1)) is one we've been experimenting with since its dependencies are relatively light and its offline execution time is definitely good enough for high-throughput NER + NEN pipelines.
