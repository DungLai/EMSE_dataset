chance its because `self._nlp` and `_nlp` are different in the code you pasted? I tried to simulate your setup, by loading the linker with umls first, and then substituting the mesh candidate generator. I get the same error as you (the full error actually shows that it is a key error resulting from a mismatched candidate generator and kb) without the kb line, but adding the kb line resolves it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [26]:     _nlp = spacy.load(_data_model)\r\n    ...:     _config = {\"resolve_abbreviations\": True,       \r\n    ...:               \"linker_name\": \"umls\"}                      \r\n    ...:                                                      \r\n    ...:     _nlp.add_pipe(\"scispacy_linker\", config=_config)         \r\n    ...:     _candidate_generator = CandidateGenerator(name=\"mesh\")\r\n    ...:     _entity_linker = _nlp.get_pipe('scispacy_linker')\r\n    ...:     _entity_linker.candidate_generator = _candidate_generator\r\n    ...:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...:     response = _nlp(\"This text has a disease.\")\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n/net/nfs2.corp/s2-research/daniel/miniconda3/envs/scispacy_3_new/lib/python3.8/site-packages/spacy/language.py in __call__(self, text, disable, component_cfg)\r\n    988             try:\r\n--> 989                 doc = proc(doc, **component_cfg.get(name, {}))\r\n    990             except KeyError as e:\r\n\r\n/net/nfs2.corp/s2-research/daniel/miniconda3/envs/scispacy_3_new/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scispacy/linking.py in __call__(self, doc)\r\n    120                     self.filter_for_definitions\r\n--> 121                     and self.kb.cui_to_entity[cand.concept_id].definition is None\r\n    122                     and score < self.no_definition_threshold\r\n\r\nKeyError: 'D000078623'\r\n\r\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-26-808026450e1f> in <module>\r\n      8 _entity_linker.candidate_generator = _candidate_generator\r\n      9 \r\n---> 10 response = _nlp(\"This text has a disease.\")\r\n\r\n/net/nfs2.corp/s2-research/daniel/miniconda3/envs/scispacy_3_new/lib/python3.8/site-packages/spacy/language.py in __call__(self, text, disable, component_cfg)\r\n    990             except KeyError as e:\r\n    991                 # This typically happens if a component is not initialized\r\n--> 992                 raise ValueError(Errors.E109.format(name=name)) from e\r\n    993             except Exception as e:\r\n    994                 error_handler(name, proc, [doc], e)\r\n\r\nValueError: [E109] Component 'scispacy_linker' could not be run.
