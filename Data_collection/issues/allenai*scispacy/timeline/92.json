You'll want to make sure that for `scispacy` version `0.1.0` you have `spacy` version `2.0.18` and use models that have `0.1.0` in the url, like this one `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.1.0/en_core_sci_sm-0.1.0.tar.gz`. We just upgraded `scispacy` to version `0.2.0` which is compatible with `spacy` version `2.1.3` and requires models with `0.2.0` in the url, like this one `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.2.0/en_core_sci_sm-0.2.0.tar.gz`.
