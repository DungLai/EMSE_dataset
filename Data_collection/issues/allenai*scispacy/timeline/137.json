I think nmslib is a bit tricky to install as it is a python wrapper to a C++ library. It seems like the order of installation here might have caused this problem. It's a bit tricky to test stuff like this because i'm fairly certain it is system specific. I'll leave this open and see if other people have had the same issue.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in testing it, you could try adding numpy to the requirements file at the top, cloning the repo and running `python setup.py install` in a clean conda environment. If that works for you, i'll definitely add numpy.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/514212097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/514475507","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/137#issuecomment-514475507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/137","id":514475507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDQ3NTUwNw==","user":{"login":"lfoppiano","id":15426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano","html_url":"https://github.com/lfoppiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T04:32:57Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T04:32:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've tested and indeed it requires numpy as dependency on top in the `setup.py` would avoid failing the installation, however I got stuck on the following point: \r\n\r\n```\r\nnmslib.cc:16:10: fatal error: 'pybind11/pybind11.h' file not found\r\n  #include <pybind11/pybind11.h>\r\n           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n  1 error generated.\r\n  error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I\"m not sure how to solve... cause `pybind11` is installed but the error persist.

afterwards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/520448695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SaulAryehKohn","id":7569274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjkyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7569274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn","html_url":"https://github.com/SaulAryehKohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaulAryehKohn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2550396287,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU1MDM5NjI4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2550396287","actor":{"login":"lfoppiano","id":15426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano","html_url":"https://github.com/lfoppiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T14:29:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2550396289,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NTAzOTYyODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/2550396289","actor":{"login":"lfoppiano","id":15426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano","html_url":"https://github.com/lfoppiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfoppiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T14:29:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/520508744","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/137#issuecomment-520508744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/137","id":520508744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDUwODc0NA==","user":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T17:01:27Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T17:01:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"FYI I merged a pin for pybind into nmslib, which should hopefully fix some of these issues: https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/pull/405\r\n\r\nBecause pybind is a common library, it is frequently already installed, so unless a library specifically pins it, it won't be updated. In particular, there was an issue with pypi's ability to find pybind C headers which are needed for building C/C++ extensions, which they have now apparently fixed in a newer version of pybind than what nmslib were using. So once nmslib release a new version, we can pin to that and see if it helps.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/520508744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/521532570","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/137#issuecomment-521532570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/137","id":521532570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTUzMjU3MA==","user":{"login":"adityajo","id":13349601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13349601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo","html_url":"https://github.com/adityajo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityajo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T06:36:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T06:36:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"pip install failed for me as well. \r\n\r\nIt also screwed up with my conda installation - thanks to the conda configuration that the tutorial wants me to create.
