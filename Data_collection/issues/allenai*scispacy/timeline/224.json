Sorry you are right, I miss read your question. Spacy also does not provide this functionality, so it is unlikely we will. It's possible you can call `spacy.cli.download` with a url path, i'm not sure. Regardless, I don't think having models as dependencies is 100% useful (they can be large, you want to cache them in a way you don't want to with normal dependencies) so it's unlikely we will implement this.

[BBS-284](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBS-284).\r\n\r\nPyPI doesn't allow dependencies outside of PyPI:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Packages installed from PyPI cannot depend on packages which are not also hosted on PyPI.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PR moves the dependencies outside of PyPI to `extras_require` in `setup.py`.\r\n\r\nThese dependencies are the NLP models.\r\n\r\n## How to test?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to test until the GitHub repository is made public (see the discussion in the [JIRA ticket](https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/BBS-284)).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR refers to an issue present in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BlueBrainSearch/issues).\r\n- [x] Travis CI pipeline run.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BlueBrain/Search/issues/235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BlueBrain/Search/issues/235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
