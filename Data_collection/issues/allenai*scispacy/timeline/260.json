think this behaviour might be expected, because the NER model will run at the sentence level (i.e entities which cross sentence boundaries would not be allowed) - if the parser is not set, there will be no sentences in the doc and so the NER model will run on the full input, which looks like it has confused your fine tuned NER model here.\r\n\r\nAre the entities you are fine tuning it on very long?
