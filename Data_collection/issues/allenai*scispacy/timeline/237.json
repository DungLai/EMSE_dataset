@DeNeutoy, thanks for the information! I'm happy to share that I managed to create my custom Entity Linker based on the 2020AA release. It took a bit longer (~8 hours) to build the ANN index, but this could very well be because of the size of my UMLS subset (all level 0 sources + SNOMED).  \r\n\r\nOverall, it was not tÃ³Ã³ difficult to do, but I think some small changes in the code would make it even easier. I don't have an answer to this question myself yet -- if I have time and I do think of a good solution, I will try to see if I can help out by creating a PR. But I think it comes down to the following:\r\n\r\n`CandidateGenerator()` currently accepts a pre-trained linker (`umls` or `mesh`), for which the default `LinkerPaths` have been defined globally in the `candidate_generation.py`. While it is possible to provide your own `ann_index`, `tfidf_vectorizer`, `ann_concept_aliases_list` and `kb`, these will first have to be loaded using `load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index`, and this one only accepts a `LinkerPaths` object.  So I ended up writing something like the following (based on how it's done for the pre-trained `umls` and `mesh` linkers in `candidate_generation.py`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport json\r\nimport joblib\r\n\r\nfrom scispacy.linking_utils import UmlsKnowledgeBase\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import (\r\n    CandidateGenerator,\r\n    LinkerPaths,\r\n    load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index,\r\n)\r\n\r\nCustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(\r\n    ann_index=\"path/to/nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectorizer=\"path/to//nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectors=\"path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib\",\r\n    concept_aliases_list=\"path/to/concept_aliases.json\",\r\n)\r\n\r\n# set default release\r\nDEFAULT_RELEASE = \"2020AA\"\r\nDEFAULT_KB_PATH = \"path/to/2020AA.json\"\r\nDEFAULT_PATHS = {\"2020AA\": CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA}\r\n\r\n\r\ndef load_candidate_generator(\r\n    release: str = DEFAULT_RELEASE, kb_path: str = DEFAULT_KB_PATH,\r\n) -> CandidateGenerator:\r\n    \"\"\"Loads a pre-trained custom scispacy candidate generator by\r\n    loading the different model components from disk.\r\n\r\n    release: str\r\n        The name of the pretrained candidate generator to load. \r\n        Currently, the only available (and default) is \"2020AA\".\r\n\r\n    kb_path: str\r\n        Path to the Knowledge Base in JSON format as required by scispacy.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    # create LinkerPaths\r\n    linker_paths = DEFAULT_PATHS[release]\r\n\r\n    # load ann_index, tfifd_vectorizer and ann_concept_aliases_list\r\n    ann_index = load_approximate_nearest_neighbours_index(linker_paths=linker_paths)\r\n    tfidf_vectorizer = joblib.load(linker_paths.tfidf_vectorizer)\r\n    with open(linker_paths.concept_aliases_list, \"r\") as f:\r\n        ann_concept_aliases_list = json.load(f)\r\n\r\n    # load UMLS KnowledgeBase (converted json file)\r\n    umls_kb = UmlsKnowledgeBase(file_path=kb_path)\r\n\r\n    # create candidate generator\r\n    candidate_generator = CandidateGenerator(\r\n        ann_index=ann_index,\r\n        tfidf_vectorizer=tfidf_vectorizer,\r\n        ann_concept_aliases_list=ann_concept_aliases_list,\r\n        kb=umls_kb,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    return candidate_generator\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but think it would be great if instead, you could simply provide the paths to the necessary files directly when initiating a `CandidateGenerator`, so that you could do something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    candidate_generator = CandidateGenerator(\r\n        ann_index=\"path/to/ann_index\",\r\n        tfidf_vectorizer=\"path/to/tfidf_vectorizer\",\r\n        ann_concept_aliases_list=\"path/to/ann_concept_aliases_list\",\r\n        kb=\"path/to/kb\",\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope I explained my thoughts properly :-) Thanks and keep up the good work!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/650269323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ChantalvanSon","id":6689853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6689853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon","html_url":"https://github.com/ChantalvanSon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3487278990,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ4NzI3ODk5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3487278990","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:23:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3487278992,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0ODcyNzg5OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3487278992","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:23:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/651504169","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/237#issuecomment-651504169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/237","id":651504169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTUwNDE2OQ==","user":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T03:25:04Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T03:25:04Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @ChantalvanSon ,\r\n\r\nGreat that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nYou raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import (\r\n    CandidateGenerator,\r\n    LinkerPaths\r\n)\r\n\r\nCustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(\r\n    ann_index=\"path/to/nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectorizer=\"path/to//nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectors=\"path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib\",\r\n    concept_aliases_list=\"path/to/concept_aliases.json\",\r\n)\r\nclass UMLS2020KnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        file_path: str = \"path/to/2020AA.json\",\r\n    ):\r\n        super().__init__(file_path)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Admittedly this is a bit of a hack, because we are mutating a global object.\r\n# However, it's just a kind of registry, so maybe it's ok.\r\nDEFAULT_PATHS[\"umls2020\"] = CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA\r\nDEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[\"umls2020\"] = UMLS2020KnowledgeBase\r\n\r\nlinker = CandidateGenerator(name=\"umls2020\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented). However I definitely see your point that we should try to make this a bit nicer. In another project I used to work on, we had the concept of using a decorator to register this type of info with the base class, so it can construct itself. That might be a bit of overkill here, but maybe we could provide a function which does this global mutation for you and throws intelligent errors if you e.g try to overwrite something in there? \r\n\r\nI think you're right that we need to fix this if we want people to frequently be able to create their own very specific/custom linkers though so thanks for raising

linkers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/655621479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3526030806,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUyNjAzMDgwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3526030806","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T16:23:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3526030817,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzUyNjAzMDgxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3526030817","actor":{"login":"ChantalvanSon","id":6689853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6689853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon","html_url":"https://github.com/ChantalvanSon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T16:23:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3526030822,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1MjYwMzA4MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/events/3526030822","actor":{"login":"ChantalvanSon","id":6689853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODk4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6689853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon","html_url":"https://github.com/ChantalvanSon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChantalvanSon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T16:23:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.co

When I match CUI to SNOMED it gives different meanings in SNOMED vocabulary. \r\nCurrently, I am mapping CUI to SNOMED using UMLS MRCONSO.RRF mapping file. \r\nI am exploring is there any way that we can replace newly trained EntityLiker, Like train aliases directly with SNOMED code instead of CUI. \r\nI have the text with their aliases and a unique ID for the same. \r\n\r\nPlease suggest me.

I read several previous discussions about adding a custom KB to scispacy instead of using the preset ones and a helpful discussion I found was in: #331 and #237.\r\n\r\nI followed the steps and I managed to run the script with my jsonl and managed to get some outputs (4 specifically) but I am not quite clear how to proceed from here.\r\n\r\nHere is my code (I ran on jupyter notebook):\r\n```\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES\r\nfrom scispacy.candidate_generation import (\r\n    CandidateGenerator,\r\n    LinkerPaths\r\n)\r\nfrom scispacy.linking_utils import KnowledgeBase\r\nimport spacy\r\n\r\nCustomLinkerPaths_mycustom = LinkerPaths(\r\n    ann_index=\"output/nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectorizer=\"output//nmslib_index.bin\",\r\n    tfidf_vectors=\"output/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib\",\r\n    concept_aliases_list=\"output/concept_aliases.json\",\r\n)\r\nclass myKnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        file_path: str = \"custom_kb.jsonl\",\r\n    ):\r\n

spacy.load(\"new_model\")\r\nnlp.add_pipe(\"scispacy_linker\", config={\"resolve_abbreviations\": True, \"linker_name\": \"myCustom\"})\r\n```\r\n This gave me the error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: [E002] Can't find factory for 'scispacy_linker' for language English (en). This usually happens when spaCy calls `nlp.create_pipe` with a custom component name that's not registered on the current language class. If you're using a Transformer, make sure to install 'spacy-transformers'. If you're using a custom component, make sure you've added the decorator `@Language.component` (for function components) or `@Language.factory` (for class components).\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering how I should do this. From my understanding, we would like to add this new `linker_name` and its paths to the scispacy EntityLinker class but is there a way to do it from importing the scispacy from pip install. Or is the only method to clone the scispacy repository and edit the EntityLinker file?\r\n\r\nIs my understanding right? Any help would be appreciated.
