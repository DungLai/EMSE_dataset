did my best to match everything to the old versions, and our reported accuracy didn't drop much I don't think, but there are a bunch of hyperparams that we haven't really done any search over, just tried to use whatever spacy is using. If you wanted to play around with retraining with different hyperparameters or something, all the training scripts should be clear from project.yml","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/885233934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/886833395","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/342#issuecomment-886833395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/342","id":886833395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPNzOc403ADz","user":{"login":"mbrunecky","id":59574493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTc0NDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59574493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrunecky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrunecky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-26T16:07:00Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:07:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As an original author of explosion/spaCy#8138 (which has been closed), I **still** keep trying to figure out what has changed.\r\nI have a case where the 'accuracy' in the downstream application has dropped over **20%**, despite Spacy training validation scores dropping less than 5%.
