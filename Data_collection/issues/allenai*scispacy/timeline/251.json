I am not sure why spacy splits up `MULTI-TISSUE_STRUCTURE` when displaying `nlp.entity.labels`, perhaps this is just some formatting thing, like maybe spacy expects no hyphens in the labels or something. I'd have to look into that more, but since you said the model does predict `MULTI-TISSUE_STRUCTURE`, I'm guessing this is not affecting the model either.

The reason is found in [these lines of the source code|\r\nhttps://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/pipeline/pipes.pyx#L1124-L1133]. Basically, `labels` is a `property` set by taking `label = move.split(\"-\")[1]` for each `move in model.entity.move_names`. So you should remove hyphens or `model.entity.labels` will be broken: can you do that? \r\n\r\n> The third list is just wrong (it is missing PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION and ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE), and we need

will likely not be fixing the issue in `nlp.entity.labels` for this version, as it would require retraining the model, but you can get the complete list from `nlp.entity.move_names` if you desire.

small changes:\r\n1) The list of entity names in the docs for bionlp was incomplete\r\n2) spacy apparently assumes entity names do not have hyphens when returning the set of entities (see #251). One of the bionlp entities has a hyphen, so i added to the data loading replacing the hyphen with an underscore. I don't believe this impacts the model at all, just the printing of the entity names.\r\n\r\nand then one additional point. When I trained the models last time, I did intend for the parser, tagger and proper vocab from the md model to be included in the specialized NER models, but I did not actually intend for the NER pipe to start training from the md NER pipe. It is not obvious to me whether this should help or hurt, but something to consider for next time. If we wanted to start the NER pipe from scratch, we would just change here https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/c286a325c7678c8d58744563c763d93e86251494/scripts/train_specialised_ner.py#L76 to create a new pipe and remove the existing NER pipe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/662156094","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/251#issuecomment-662156094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/251","id":662156094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjE1NjA5NA==","user":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-21T23:23:34Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T23:23:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'm going to go ahead and close this.
