You will want to experiment with different models and combine predictions from multiple, limiting to the types that are of interest to you. For example, diseases are in the BC5CDR, but drug names might appear in multiple models. Possibly start with BC5CDR and see if that works for you. As for what GGP and CL are specifically, there are more details about the craft corpus here: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-161. But loosely speaking, GGP is genes and proteins, and CL is cell types. @DeNeutoy can you confirm what GGP is? It isn't directly listed in the CRAFT documentation.\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, our paper about scispacy is now on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07669.pdf\r\n\r\nPotentially related issue: is there easy to access documentation for entity labels within scispaCy? Labels are working fine, but I need a way to provide a short description of what each label means, since some aren't self-explanatory.
