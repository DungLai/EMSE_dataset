Each of the models has a different vocab and so components from separate models will not be compatible. There may be a workaround here that I don't know about, but for now I think what we would suggest for this use case is running the pipelines separately and then attempting to merge their outputs yourself by iterating over the resulting docs together. For example, this might look something like running en_core_sci_sm on text, then running en_ner_bionlp13cg_md on text, then iterating over the two resulting docs together and labeling entities on one doc using the other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/468504846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/comments/468505669","html_url":"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/82#issuecomment-468505669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/82","id":468505669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODUwNTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"gabrieledicerbo","id":40320537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzIwNTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40320537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrieledicerbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrieledicerbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T01:25:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T01:25:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh you are absolutely right!
