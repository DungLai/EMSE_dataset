See an example of the difference for your sentence below. Perhaps we should write our own noun chunker based on our dependency parser, but I am really not an expert in linguistics. You might get some mileage from adapting spacy's noun chunker based on patterns you observe from our dependency parser. Also, @DeNeutoy do you have any thoughts about this?\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [14]: [(t.text, t.pos_, t.dep_) for t in sci_doc]\r\nOut[14]: \r\n[('CCR5(+', 'NOUN', 'nsubjpass'),\r\n (')', 'PUNCT',
