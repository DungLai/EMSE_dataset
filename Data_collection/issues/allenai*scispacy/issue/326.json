I have tried with _en_core_sci_sm_, _en_core_sci_md_ and _en_core_sci_lg_. For example when I input the sentence \"CCR5(+) and CXCR3(+) T cells are increased in multiple sclerosis and their ligands MIP-1alpha and IP-10 are expressed in demyelinating brain lesions.\" I only get \"CCR5(+\", \"CXCR3(+\" and \"T cells\" as chunks and I would expect more chunks. For example, using spaCys _en_core_web_trf_ I get \"CCR5(+) and CXCR3(+) T cells\", \"multiple sclerosis\", \"their ligands\", \"MIP-1alpha\", \"IP-10\" and \"brain lesions\". \r\n\r\nIs the chunking supposed to work in a similar way as spaCys pipelines or have I misinterpreted something?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nBest regards ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
