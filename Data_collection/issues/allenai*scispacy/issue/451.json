Actually food is the correct direct object. Instead, the conj link should connect gerbil to its correct parent hamster, and hamster should have an amod link to food.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8377815/195636769-ecaba5d0-4e91-4fcb-88be-bae596700be9.png)\r\n\r\nIt is hard to assign conjunction correctly. But maybe it is useful to upscore the options where the two co-ordinated terms are of similar weight. It seems possible to recognise that \"hamster and gerbil\" is more likely than \"hamster and [gerbil food]\"\r\n\r\nScispacy is amazing, and gets the correct parsing with impressive frequency.
