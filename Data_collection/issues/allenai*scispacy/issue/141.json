I'm trying to use the same options in scispacy for the named entities. I simply created two lists of `entities` and randomly generated `colors` and put them in `options` dictionary like the following:\r\n\r\n`options = {\"ents\": entities, \"colors\": colors}`\r\n\r\nWhere `entities` is a list of NEs in scispacy NER models and `colors` is a list of the same size. But using such an option in either `displacy.serve` or `displacy.render (for jupyter)` does not work. I'm using the options like the following:\r\n\r\n`displacy.serve(doc, style=\"ent\", options=options)`\r\n\r\nI wonder if using the color option only works for predefined named entities in the Spacy or there's something wrong with the way I'm using the option?","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
