It was giving good results but not giving all the disease-related entities.\r\n**Eg:**  patient was not able to attend work due to influenza\r\nFor the above example, it's not returning **influenza**. Like this, there are many examples like \"flu\" and many others.\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I moved to **en_core_sci_lg**  which is actually giving all the medical-related entities from the text. But, the problem was, it doesn't classify the entity into categories ( like disease, treatment).\r\nWhen I explored further, I understood that I can take the help of UMLS integration, where for each entity returned by the en_core_sci_lg, we can extract the umls_ent using entity._.umls_ents and then get it's **concept name, concept id, type** and even threshold score.\r\n\r\nHere I am using **type**, and by using **type codes** from **UMLS_Semantic_Type_Tree**, I am trying to classify the entity into either Disease or treatment. Problem is,  I'm getting false positives by using this approach and also sometimes I am missing the entities too.\r\n\r\nPlease find the disease, treatment codes, and also other things which I am using in my code.\r\n\r\n**disease_codes** : T041, T047, T048, T184, T191, T005\r\n**treatment_codes** : T091, T061, T060, T059\r\n**linker_lg = UmlsEntityLinker(k=5)** and also tried **max_entities_per_mention** parameter with different values.\r\n\r\nPlease find some of the **False Positives** below:\r\n**Disease:** push pull, drive, global delay, decision, reasoning e.t.c\r\n**Treatment:** medication delivery, hygiene, elevation, counseling group e.t.c\r\n\r\nSo, what else I can do to improve the results?\r\n\r\nWill training model on my own data, helps here? or do we have a better approach?\r\n\r\nAlso Just want to add, sometimes the sentences which I have, won't follow any grammar and there can be spelling mistakes too. \r\nIt can be as worse as \r\n\" patient hdache nt sleepng well \"\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
