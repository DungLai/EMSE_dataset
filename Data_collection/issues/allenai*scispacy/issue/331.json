I really appreciate the addition of the transformer and entity-linking.\r\n\r\nWhile I have experience using spacy for ner and rel, I am quite new to ontologies and building spacy entity-linkers/knowledge bases. Would it be possible to get another ontology (specifically, https://github.com/Planteome/plant-trait-ontology) added? Or a tutorial/description of how I could do this myself?\r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\nBlake","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/331/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
