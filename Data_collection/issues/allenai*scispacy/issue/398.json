We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood \r\n\r\n.\r\n\"\"\"\r\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\r\n\r\nword_tokens = word_tokenize(text)\r\n \r\nfiltered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w.lower() in stop_words]\r\n \r\nfiltered_sentence =[]\r\n \r\nfor w in word_tokens:\r\n    if w not in stop_words:\r\n        filtered_sentence.append(w)\r\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_ner_bc5cdr_md\")\r\n#linker = UmlsEntityLinker(k=10,max_entities_per_mention = 2)\r\ndoc = nlp(text)\r\nentity = doc.ents\r\nentity = [str(item) for item in entity]\r\nentity = str(OrderedDict.fromkeys(entity))\r\nentity = nlp(entity).ents\r\nfor entity in entity:\r\n    for umls_ent in entity._.umls_ents:\r\n        print(\"Entity_name\",entity)\r\n        Concept_id,Score = umls_ent\r\n        print(\"concept_id={} Score {}\".format(Concept_id,Score))\r\n       \r\n\r\nBut i am getting an error\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Python_projects\\Second_tria;\\demo.py\", line 9, in <module>\r\n    from scispacy.umls_linking import UmlsEntityLinker\r\n  File \"<frozen zipimport>\", line 259, in load_module\r\n  File \"C:\\Python39\\lib\\site-packages\\scispacy-0.4.0-py3.9.egg\\scispacy\\umls_linking.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n  File \"<frozen zipimport>\", line 259, in load_module\r\n  File \"C:\\Python39\\lib\\site-packages\\scispacy-0.4.0-py3.9.egg\\scispacy\\linking.py\", line 5, in <module>\r\n  File \"<frozen zipimport>\", line 259, in load_module\r\n  File \"C:\\Python39\\lib\\site-packages\\scispacy-0.4.0-py3.9.egg\\scispacy\\candidate_generation.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nmslib'\r\n\r\n\r\nplease help\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
