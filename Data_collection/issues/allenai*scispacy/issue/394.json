If you prefer I can make separate issues for each of them but I think it's clearer to have a single issue.\r\n\r\nFirst small question: Is the documentation for the linkers and candidate generators outdated? The docstring for CandidateGenerator says\r\n\r\n>      A candidate generator for entity linking to a KnowledgeBase. Currently, two defaults are available:\r\n>      - Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).\r\n>      - Medical Subject Headings (MESH)\r\n\r\nBut the readme lists a few other ontologies as well (and they do seem to be handled in the code)\r\n\r\nSecond higher level question:  I'm interested in your reasons for using specifically 3-gram tf-idf vectorization for ANN for candidate generation? Did you publish a paper or something I could read?  I would like to experiment with using pre-trained word embeddings instead, but it seems like a rather obvious idea, so I'm curious if there are reasons you didn't do that in the first place?\r\n\r\nRelated to that, if I wanted to generate an index based on word embeddings - how expensive is the generation of the ANN index? I only have limited computing capabilities available, and the default value for the number of threads in https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/3d153ddad1f11f000f961f7a92c0d862b93c0973/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L396\r\n\r\n>    num_threads = 60  # set based on the machine\r\n\r\nWorries me a little. I don't want to spend a lot of time preparing this only to find out that the training is way too expensive to be done in a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
