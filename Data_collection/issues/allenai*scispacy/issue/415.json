As runtimes are cleared fairly often, this means re-downloading the KBs. Perhaps there is a way to alter `Path.home` from `pathlib`? Another option is to allow the user to enter a cache folder, which Colab users could set to their Google Drive (fwiw just a regular folder as seen by python within Colab), thus making the download permanent.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
