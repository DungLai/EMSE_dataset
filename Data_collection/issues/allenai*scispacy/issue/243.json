Especially, there seems to be an issue if two entities occur consecutively.  For example, see the following sentence from the BioNLP13-CG corpus and the predicted entities (using en_ner_bionlp13cg_md): \r\n\r\n- METHOD: The intratumor microvessel density (IMVD), apoptotic index (AI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry SABC and terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling(TUNEL) methods in34 LSCC patients.\r\n -> intratumor microvessel(TISSUE)\r\n -> IMVD(GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT)\r\n -> vascular endothelial growth factor(GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT)\r\n -> VEGF(GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT)\r\n -> **LSCC patients(CANCER)**\r\n\r\nNormally it should be LSCC (CANCER) and patients (SPECIES/ORGANISM). The latter should be easily recognizable by the model.
