But nothing I've tried has succeeded.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if this has happened to others and also obviously if there is a fix haha\r\n\r\nIt's a shame I was looking forward to using the library\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nShould mention that I've read this thread:\r\nhttps://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/137\r\n\r\nAnd this thread on nmslib's github:\r\nhttps://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/issues/508\r\n\r\nHope that helps","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
