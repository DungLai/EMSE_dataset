That’s why any “complete” disease ontology that uses MeSH will also use OMIM.\r\nMy question is: Is there any way to do this with scispacy? Like any way to use both systems for a piece of text so that what MeSH misses OMIM covers.\r\n\r\nThey also have this thing in the NCBI dataset (disease annotated dataset), so for diseases that do not have any id in MeSH they have used the OMIM system for it.  (see the image attached)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (75)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84127491/166462649-9bbd3ab6-bd3e-46a9-b7b2-a7f7dcd6b668.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for your time reading this.
