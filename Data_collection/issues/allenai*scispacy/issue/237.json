Is that still correct? I think it would be useful to add this information to the README as well. \r\n\r\n**Custom UMLS linker**\r\nSomewhat related to #234: would it also be possible to link the entities to a local UMLS subset (installed with [MetamorphoSys](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html)) for people with a [UMLS license](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking is twofold:\r\n\r\n1.  UMLS is released [twice a year](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsarchives04.html) in the first weeks of May and November. The current version is [2020AA](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) and contains new concepts, such as COVID-19, that will currently not be detected by scispacy. Unless you're planning to do frequent updates on the model, I'd like to be able to use the most frequent concepts.\r\n2. UMLS is highly customisable; users can select their own subsets of the many [vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html). It would be great if this customisability is also applied in scispacy.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that it is possible by:\r\n\r\n- Converting a UMLS `MRCONSO.RFF` file to JSON using [export_uml_json.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scripts/export_uml_json.py)\r\n- Generating a [KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/linking_utils.py#L45) object \r\n- Training a new linker using [create_tfidf_ann_index()](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L325 )\r\n\r\nIs this correct? Any help or more detailed instructions would be greatly appreciated!","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
