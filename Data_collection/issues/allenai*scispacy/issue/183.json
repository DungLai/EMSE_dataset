My goal is to do Relation Extraction on biomedical papers. \r\n\r\nNow on my problem: I want to try scispaCy using a pre-trained model like [BioBERT](https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained), then fine-tune with [datasets (these are the train.tsv, dev.tsv, etc) on biomedical RE](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert) and finally evaluate.\r\n\r\nI already converted the BioBERT weights to pytorch format but I don't know if this is relevant to make it work with the spaCy library?\r\nI guess at some point I should package it for spaCy, but no idea how to go from checkpoint files (which is the format of the BioBERT model) or pytorch formatted files, to spaCy. Is this feasible?\r\n\r\nAlso the [fine-tuning RE datasets](https://academic.oup.com/view-large/164293067) should be converted right? (I couldn't get the format of the .tsv files, all I could see is the test.tsv files have \"index\tsentence\tlabel\" in the first row. \r\n\r\nAny sample script for a similar task is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
