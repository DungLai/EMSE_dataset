One example is:\r\n\r\nOriginal text: _A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?_\r\n\r\nNew text: _overweight woman urgent care clinic complaint severe abdominal pain hours complains dull pain nausea vomiting pain food medical history recurrent abdominal pain cholelithiasis died age abdominal cancer temperature respirations pulse blood pressure mm Hg Physical exam CT scan abdomen gallbladder diagnoses patient_ \r\n\r\nIn the medical domain, such numbers are usually important for understanding the symptoms of a patient and we expected the numbers to be in kept in the text after using the model. However, this is not the case. \r\n\r\nWe are loading the model in the following way:\r\n```\r\nspacy.load(\r\n                \"en_core_sci_sm\",\r\n                disable=[\r\n                    \"tok2vec\",\r\n                    \"tagger\",\r\n                    \"parser\",\r\n                    \"attribute_ruler\",\r\n                    \"lemmatizer\",\r\n                ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there an explanation for why numbers are not kept? We have tried various scispaCy models but the issue is still the same.","closed_by":{"login":"idariis","id":46669248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjY5MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46669248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis","html_url":"https://github.com/idariis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idariis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
