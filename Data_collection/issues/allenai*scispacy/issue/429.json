I see a number of comparisons in it to MetaMap, some of the early code on adding native entity linking (https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/72, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/pull/88), and then lots of more recent requests for extensions to linking like https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/428, https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/346, and https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/issues/331 which all got me curious as to whether or not you all are aware of or have potentially considered other methods/libraries for NEN.  [Gilda](https://github.com/indralab/gilda) ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.459803v1)) is one we've been experimenting with since its dependencies are relatively light and its offline execution time is definitely good enough for high-throughput NER + NEN pipelines.  The sources/ontologies covered by it include a number that make a useful complement to what's supported in ScispaCy:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"508\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-14 at 7 23 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6130352/163492718-019276cd-4a10-4ca7-812c-1d4229a102f0.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm not really advocating for it, and I can't speak to the validity of the methodological differences between it and what you all have done, but I am curious if you all are watching other projects like this and considering either integrating them or pointing users at them if they are looking for support over more nomenclatures/ontologies.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any insight here and for all the work you've done on this library!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
