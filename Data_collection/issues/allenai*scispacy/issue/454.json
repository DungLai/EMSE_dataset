If it is possible, what are the files to download? where to put them? The reason I ask is my server where I run scispacy program does not allow me to download the data file(s) from Internet. but I can download them to my work station in advance and update to the server.   \r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nFYI, Part of snippet code from the example is: \r\n```\r\n# This line takes a while, because we have to download ~1GB of data\r\n# and load a large JSON file (the knowledge base).
