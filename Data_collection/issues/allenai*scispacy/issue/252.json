For example, this is the entry for `C3657270` (Nivolumab):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCUI: C3657270, Name: nivolumab\r\nDefinition: A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.\r\nTUI(s): T116, T121, T129\r\nAliases (abbreviated, total: 19): \r\n         nivolumab, nivolumab, nivolumab, nivolumab, nivolumab, Nivolumab, Nivolumab, Nivolumab, Nivolumab, Nivolumab\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 19 aliases listed for Nivolumab are the following, which contain quite some duplicates:\r\n\r\n```python\r\naliases = linker.umls.cui_to_entity[\"C3657270\"].aliases\r\nprint(aliases)\r\n> ['nivolumab', 'nivolumab', 'nivolumab', 'nivolumab', 'nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab', 'NIVOLUMAB', 'NIVOLUMAB', 'NIVOLUMAB', 'Nivolumab (substance)', 'NIVO', 'NIVO', 'Product containing nivolumab (medicinal product)', 'Nivolumab-containing product']\r\nprint(set(aliases))\r\n> {'NIVOLUMAB', 'nivolumab', 'NIVO', 'Nivolumab', 'Nivolumab (substance)', 'Nivolumab-containing product', 'Product containing nivolumab (medicinal product)'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy are there duplicates in these lists? Do these maybe originate from the different vocabularies in UMLS (corresponding to the atoms)? And related to this question: could it make the entity linker more efficient if these aliases were de-duplicated?","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/252/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
