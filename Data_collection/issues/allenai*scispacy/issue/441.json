I (and am sure many others) are deeply grateful for all your effort and creativity.\r\nI've been experimenting with the abbreviation_detector module which has been working great. Until i found this situation: \r\nGiven the sentence:\r\n\"The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) inhibiting retinoic malate receptor (RMR) isoforms mediate ligand-independent repression.\"\r\nabbreviation_detector finds the following abbreviations:\r\nAbbreviation \t Definition\r\nTR \t (5, 6) \t thyroid hormone receptor\r\nRMR \t (12, 13) \t retinoic malate receptor\r\nreceptor \t (3, 4) \t receptor (RMR\r\nreceptor \t (10, 11) \t receptor (RMR\r\n\r\nSo, the word \"receptor\" is incorrectly identified as abbreviation. This happens only if there is one single word between \"(TR)\" and \"retinoic\".  If another token (word, space) is introduced before OR after the separating word (in this case, \"inhibiting\"), abbreviation_detector works correctly identifying only the 2 abbreviations (TR and RMR).  \r\nFrom my perspective this is totally unexpected. Could this be a bug in the algorithm? or maybe something i'm doing wrong?\r\nThanks a lot\r\nm\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
