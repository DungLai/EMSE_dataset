My hope was to use one of the `ner` models in combination with the `core_sci` tagger and dependency parser. \r\n\r\nNeuralCoref depends on the `tagger, parser, and ner`.\r\n\r\nSo far I have tried this code:\r\n```python \r\ncust_ner = spacy.load('en_ner_craft_md')\r\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_sci_md')\r\nnlp.remove_pipe('ner')\r\nnlp.add_pipe(cust_ner, name=\"ner\", last=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut when I pass text to the `nlp` object , I get the following error:\r\n`TypeError: Argument 'string' has incorrect type (expected str, got spacy.tokens.doc.Doc)`\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the `nlp.pipeline` attribute after adding the `cust_ner` to the pipe I see the `cust_ner` added as a `Language` object rather than a `EntityRecognizer` object:\r\n```python\r\n[('tagger', <spacy.pipeline.pipes.Tagger object at 0x7fb84976eda0>), ('parser', <spacy.pipeline.pipes.DependencyParser object at 0x7fb849516288>), ('ner', <spacy.lang.en.English object at 0x7fb853725668>)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore I start hacking away and writing terrible code, I thought I would reach out to see if you had any suggestions in how to accomplish what I am after?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and for all that you folks do!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
