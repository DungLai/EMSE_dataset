All experiments are done with spacy v2.3.1 and scispacy v0.2.4\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47669575/89894189-fa2f2000-dbd9-11ea-8ae5-c3dceabc16aa.png)\r\nAs you can see on the picture above:\r\n- If the parser is enabled, 4 entities are detected.\r\n- If the parser is disabled, 3 entities are detected (one of which is very long and actually contains 2 of the previous entities). \r\n\r\nHowever, here is a part of the [spaCy documentation ](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines)\r\n_In spaCy v2.x, the statistical components like the tagger or parser are independent and don’t share any data between themselves. For example, the named entity recognizer doesn’t use any features set by the tagger and parser, and so on. This means that you can swap them, or remove single components from the pipeline without affecting the others._\r\n\r\nIs it also something we can assume for ScispaCy models ? Do you have an idea why the results are different ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help,\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
