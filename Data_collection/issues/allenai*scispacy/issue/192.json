It's a great product. However, for the detection of short form (long form), it misses something like \"SBMA (Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy)\" because the `filter_matches()` function in `abbreviation.py` requires two words instead of one as a verification step. Could you fix this, please?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
