As awscli has over 1000 releases, this makes dependency resolving in tools such as poetry using scispacy take a very long time.\r\n\r\nI could not find any actual uses of the awscli package inside scispacy. What is the purpose of specifying it as a dependency? I did find a use of `requests` in  [file_cache.py](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/file_cache.py), which is of course a transitive dependency of awscli. Would it be possible to promote requests to a direct dependency of scispacy, and drop the awscli dependency? \r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
