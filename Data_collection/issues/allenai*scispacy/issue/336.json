I'm using en_ner_bc5cdr_md to extract CHEMICAL and DISEASE entities; spacy: '3.0.4', scispacy: '0.4.0'.\r\n\r\nAs you see below, remdesivir is not tagged as a CHEMICAL when I run en_ner_bc5cdr_md in Jupyter Lab. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70850242/111051780-9eed3680-8423-11eb-97a2-870f4ee12280.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, when I put the same text into your demo, I was surprised that remdesivir is found. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70850242/111051846-04412780-8424-11eb-9229-02df44ef98e8.png)\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n- Wonder if the version running on demo is the same one that I used in my notebook (spacy: '3.0.4', scispacy: '0.4.0')?\r\n- Maybe remdesivir isn't found since it wasn't present in earlier training sets? \r\n- Can we expect new chemicals to be recognized (e.g., first time ever published)?\r\n- It's especially surprising that remdesivir wasn't detected as a CHEMICAL even in the following line where it's called a 'drug' from the text used in my example: \r\n \r\n`Though the drug remdesivir (RDV) is not approved by the FDA, still the \"Emergency Use Authorization\" (EUA) for compassionate use in severe cases is endorsed.\r\n`\r\n- In the demo remdesivir is detected but only once while it is mentioned several times in that passage. Is that expected? \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nvikram","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
