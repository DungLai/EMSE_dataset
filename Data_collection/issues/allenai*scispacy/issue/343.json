Is there a way to configure scispacy to use the locally cached files and _not_ download them on every initialization?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"mnhcorp","id":2000186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDAxODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2000186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp","html_url":"https://github.com/mnhcorp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnhcorp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
