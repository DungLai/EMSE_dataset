From spaCy's documentation, I understand that pipeline components like tagger, parser, and entity recognizer are independent; and the default NER training scripts disabled all pipes other than 'NER'. The final results (entity-level F1) I got from spaCy were poor. I've been trying to find areas to improve, and have a few general questions about spaCy and sciSpacy. I'm new to NLP so I've likely missed something critical...\r\n\r\n1. Would training NER from scratch (using a blank model) with my own data yield similar results for spacy and sciSpacy? \r\n2. Would I likely benefit from training on top of the existing models like 'en_core_sci_md', or pretrained NER models like 'en_ner_craft_md'? My data do have very different entity types than those of, say, 'CRAFT' or 'JNLPBA', so I assume it'll be challenging due to conflicts in annotations.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
