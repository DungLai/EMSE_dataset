When I match CUI to SNOMED it gives different meanings in SNOMED vocabulary. \r\nCurrently, I am mapping CUI to SNOMED using UMLS MRCONSO.RRF mapping file. \r\nI am exploring is there any way that we can replace newly trained EntityLiker, Like train aliases directly with SNOMED code instead of CUI. \r\nI have the text with their aliases and a unique ID for the same. \r\n\r\nPlease suggest me.
