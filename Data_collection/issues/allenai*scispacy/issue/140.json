I downloaded the officially released models (`en_core_sci_sm-0.2.0` and `en_core_sci_md-0.2.0`) and officially released GENIA corpus (`train/dev/test.json`). I modified the scripts `parser.sh` and `train_parser_and_tagger.py`, and use them to evaluate the models. However, there seems to be large differences between the results reported in the paper, reported in the github repo and my reproduced result.\r\n\r\n- Paper: \r\n  - en_core_sci_sm: 98.38 89.69 87.67\r\n  - en_core_sci_md: 98.51 90.60 88.79\r\n- Github Repo `docs/index.md`:\r\n  - en_core_sci_sm: 98.42 89.47 87.61 \r\n  - en_core_sci_md: 98.61 89.94 88.08\r\n- My reproduced result:\r\n  - en_core_sci_sm: 98.42 89.47 84.04 \r\n  - en_core_sci_md: 98.61 89.94 84.37\r\n\r\nThe numbers are POS, UAS, LAS, respectively.\r\n\r\nCould you please check your results?
