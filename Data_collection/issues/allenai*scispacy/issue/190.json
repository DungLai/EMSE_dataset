However, when it comes to some countries next to disease names it is giving weird entities. For example a query: \r\nChina kidney failure incidence\r\nfound \"China kidney failure\" as one entity. Similar with \"United States kidney failure\". However, if kidney failure is first and name of the country second, it works well and finds countries as separate entities, while that was not the case previously. Is there any quick fix to that?
