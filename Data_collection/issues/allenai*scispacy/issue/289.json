Firstly, thanks for an amazing library - scispacy is great!!\r\n\r\nI seem to be running into some caching issues when using the linker. Periodically when running scripts that load the linker I get errors like\r\n`requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /ai2-s2-scispacy/data/kbs/2020-10-09/umls_2020_aa_cat0129.jsonl (Caused by SSLError(SSLZeroReturnError(6, 'TLS/SSL connection has been closed (EOF) (_ssl.c:1076)')))`\r\n\r\nafter having successfully run previously. I suspect this is related to caching although not sure. I have received errors like this about 3 times but it is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to manually manage the linker object? Looking at the formatting I assume it is not just that one file and is sharded.","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
