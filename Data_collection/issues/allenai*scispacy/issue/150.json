Also, \"Human induced pluripotent stem cells\" is in UMLS as CUI C3658289. However, the UMLS linker does not find that code. Instead of the long form of the abbreviation being used (which is associated with the document), the linker is using the entities from the mention detector. In this case it had found the mentions (Human, induced, pluripotent stem cells, hiPSC, fibroblasts, overexpression, pluripotency factors, Takahashi). \r\nThe result is that the abbreviation hiPSC gets candidate codes C2717959 and C0872076, which are for 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells' and 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', respectively.\r\n\r\nIt may be good to have an early step in the UMLS linker that looks for document-level abbreviations. If it finds some then exclude those spans from consideration when looking for non-abbreviated mentions.  (Or maybe let people ask for nested concepts, in which case the abbreviation spans would not be excluded).","closed_by":{"login":"dakinggg","id":43149077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ5MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43149077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg","html_url":"https://github.com/dakinggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakinggg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allenai/scispacy/issues/150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
