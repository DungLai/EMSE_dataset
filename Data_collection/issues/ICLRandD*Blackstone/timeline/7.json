of advice:\r\n\r\nIt seems very unlikely to me that a model you train will be able to tell the difference between `Private International Organisations` and `Treaty International Organisations`.\r\n\r\nConsider that the model has literally zero knowledge about the world and is essentially operating on features extracted _from the text only_. As an example, IBA is a `Private International Org`, the IMF is a `Treaty International Org` and IBM is neither. Generally speaking it is very difficult to distinguish these cases for a statistical model.\r\n\r\nSimilar comments apply to the difference between `Lawyer` and `Judge`, although I can imagine that they are often referred to with different titles etc, so maybe it is slightly more possible.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, `Book` is a great example of a Named Entity which is likely to work well, because there are things common across mentions of books, such as refererences to pages, publishing dates, editions, consistent title capitalisation. I don't know enough about what a `Command Paper` is to know if it is mentioned in a way separate from a book.\r\n\r\nGovernment department also seems like a reasonable NER label, I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/comments/521769995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DeNeutoy","id":16001974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16001974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy","html_url":"https://github.com/DeNeutoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeNeutoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/comments/521978762","html_url":"https://github.com/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/7#issuecomment-521978762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/7","id":521978762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTk3ODc2Mg==","user":{"login":"pommedeterresautee","id":1029874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjk4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee","html_url":"https://github.com/pommedeterresautee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pommedeterresautee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T11:31:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T11:31:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"At some point the model is able to memorize things, and even if it has zero world knowledge, seeing enough data points is often good enough.
