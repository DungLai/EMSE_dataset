fix for issue   #4  \r\n\r\nThe bug occurs where the short form contains a space and is enclosed in quote marks. It arrises because the algorithm checks the number of tokens in parenthses and, if there are more than three, assumes the 'long form' is in the parenthses (line 110 of abbreviations.py). A short form with a space and quote marks is four spacy tokens, so falls into this case.\r\n\r\nThis proposed fix works by adjusting the short form start / end indexes where the short form includes quotes. This follows the current implementation, but makes the adjustment outside the else statement (line 116 of abbreviation.py).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3085549619,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwODU1NDk2MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/events/3085549619","actor":{"login":"ICLRandD","id":48757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzU3NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD","html_url":"https://github.com/ICLRandD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f1e7d2b91a596218052ea96d60d31383afa61846","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/commits/f1e7d2b91a596218052ea96d60d31383afa61846","created_at":"2020-03-01T13:12:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3337466656,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzMzNzQ2NjY1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/events/3337466656","actor":{"login":"ICLRandD","id":48757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzU3NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD","html_url":"https://github.com/ICLRandD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ICLRandD/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-14T16:38:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
