Especially your custom SentenceSegmenter and NER detections works very good with our dataset of legal texts. \r\nUnfortunately this package still depends on spaCy 2.1 or more specifically on spaCy 2.1.8. This version currently has a major memory leak bug (https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3618), which has been fixed with 2.1.9. I already modified the dependency files of Blackstone, so I'm able to install spaCy 2.1.9 instead of the required 2.1.8 which works flawlessly on my machine. You might consider changing your dependencies accordingly.\r\nHowever, it would be even better if you could update to an even newer version of spaCy (e.g. 2.2+) to profit from several performance optimizations done by Explosion. There is already a pending pull request (#22) to address this issue, but without the corresponding training data you used to train the model there is no way to retrain ourselves. \r\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could update your model & package to spaCy 2.2 - as this might take some time you update your package's dependencies to spaCy 2.1.9 in the meantime to circumvent memory leaks present in spaCy 2.1.9.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/24/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ICLRandD/Blackstone/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
