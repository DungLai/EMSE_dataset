By and large, the current model does an okayish job splitting sentences, but it will get baffled on older material where punctation had a tendency to be crop dusted over the text. \r\n\r\nWe did sketch a sentence pipeline out during the development of the proto model (primarily to help with the data extraction for training the model itself), but it was put together in a bit of a flap. \r\n\r\nI rather like [scispaCy's implementation](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/custom_sentence_segmenter.py), which makes use of a [list for abbreviations and section contractions](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/consts.py).
