(I thought we also need [GO], [PAD], [UNK] or something more), \r\nwe decided to follow the paper: \r\nonly use 1 additional token [EOS], and make the output units for character prediction 37 (= 10 numbers + 26 alphabets + [EOS]).\r\nTo do so, in our paper experiments, we took a similar way with https://github.com/marvis/ocr_attention which just concatenated target labels without padding.\r\n\r\nAnd in this repository, for better readability, we used [[GO] token as [PAD] token](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/blob/master/utils.py#L82), and then ignoring index [GO] token = ignore index [PAD] token.\r\n= In our code, the output units for character prediction is 38 (= 37 + [GO] token) and ignoring [GO] token.\r\n\r\nOf course, when you do not need to reproduce the previous works, we recommend using other tokens as well as [EOS] token, such as [PAD], [GO], [EOS], [UNK]... and then ignore_index = [PAD] token index.\r\n\r\nBest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/537869551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2683417407,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY4MzQxNzQwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2683417407","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-03T09:38:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/537908950","html_url":"https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/83#issuecomment-537908950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/83","id":537908950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzkwODk1MA==","user":{"login":"linhuifj","id":12070047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDcwMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12070047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj","html_url":"https://github.com/linhuifj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhuifj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-03T11:40:17Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T11:40:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you.
