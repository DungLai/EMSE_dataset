\r\nHello, \r\nI guess that is the problem of training data (with over 80% of confidence).\r\nMJSynth and SynthText have little 'long numeric text'.\r\nYou can download MJSynth and check whose vocabulary.\r\nand, the corpus of SynthText is made from News Group dataset, which has little 'long numeric text'.\r\nI didn't investigate them thoroughly, but I guess this is the reason why.\r\n\r\nThus, if you want to recognize 'long numeric texts' (which have the easier background and non-irregular shape), generate or gather some 'long numeric texts' and train the model with them.\r\nThe model accuracy would be much better.\r\n\r\nor, as @YacobBY did, use CRAFT to split long text (or just detect 2 boxes in 1 word) is also good way :)\r\n\r\nBest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/515332414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2511636273,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxMTYzNjI3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2511636273","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T06:50:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2511636276,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMTYzNjI3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2511636276","actor":{"login":"marcoromelli","id":4124102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjQxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4124102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoromelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T06:50:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2511636277,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MTE2MzYyNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2511636277","actor":{"login":"marcoromelli","id":4124102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjQxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4124102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoromelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoromelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-26T06:50:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2511636281,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUxMTYzNjI4MQ==","url":"ht

all for the contribution.\r\n\r\n@YacobBY The image I attached is already the output of CRAFT from a bigger image, do you think applying CRAFT again on it makes sense in general? I'm not really sure of this. It is true that using some splitting strategy would help, but it's hard to implement something robust to different types of fonts and backgrounds styles.\r\n\r\n@ku21fan I had some experience with a CRNN model trained on the same synthetic data which never showed issues with long sequences (it did show issues with curved texts), but you're right that this is probably an issue.
