We tried both of them, and usually use de-rotated box. \r\nThe performance gap between them seems to vary depending on the dataset.\r\nThus, it is worth trying both for your own dataset.\r\n\r\n2. If detection methods perfectly crop the word, probably the spatial transformation step would not be necessary.\r\nBut, in my opinion, spatial transformation is still worth. \r\nBecause the detection methods do not perfectly crop the word yet (its hard especially on irregular datasets), and thus spatial transformation could enhance detection result as mentioned in [ASTER paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8395027) (See section 5). \r\nand also spatial transformation might reduce the burden of the detector

for clarification\r\n\r\nIn my opinion rotation of text is a problem when you have multiple lines of text (or even text with some boundaries). Then in bigger axis aligned bbox you have a mix of two lines for some steps and this can be confusing (of course in theory fiducial points should detect the proper line).\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you know any good tool for rotated bbox annotations?
