\r\nFirst of all, I have seen that the behaviors of CTCLoss in PyTorch 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 (or other versions) are different.\r\n\r\nThe model trained with PyTorch 1.2.0 and our current code ([A] below code, GPU calculation) has 1 % lower accuracy (total accuracy is about 78.3).\r\n```\r\n[A]\r\n#criterion / preds / text / pred_size / length are cuda tensor\r\n            torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False\r\n            cost = criterion(preds, text, preds_size, length)\r\n            torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe model trained with PyTorch 1.1.0 and our previous code [B] has close accuracy of our pretrained model (total accuracy is above 79.3%). \r\n```\r\n[B]\r\n#criterion / preds are cuda tensor\r\n            cost = criterion(preds, text, preds_size, length)\r\n```\r\nand the result of the CTC model in PyTorch 1.1.0 seems to be more fluctuate but better accuracy than PyTorch 1.2.0.\r\nStrangely, when I try to train with PyTorch 1.2.0 and code [B], the training loss went to NAN and could not train the model..\r\n\r\n\r\nI also found calculating CTCLoss in CPU and in GPU have different results, and in CPU has better accuracy (total accuracy is about 78.7).\r\ni.e.\r\n```\r\n            cost = criterion(preds.cpu(), text.cpu(), preds_size.cpu(), length.cpu())\r\n```\r\nwould make a different result.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments in our paper were performed with PyTorch 0.4.1 and [warp-ctc](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc) \r\nand our pretrained model is trained with PyTorch 1.1.0.\r\nSo, if you want to reproduce the result of CTC modules now, you should use these environments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am finding the reason and a way which is compatible with PyTorch 1.2.0 without accuracy decay.
