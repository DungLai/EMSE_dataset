\r\n\r\nIn general, the scene text recognition task predicts one word for one image, as shown [here](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark#prediction-results).\r\n\r\nDoes 'images with a bunch of words on it' indicates scene image which has many text regions? like this image?\r\n![img_16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7953971/61023283-43fc7400-a3e4-11e9-884a-15f795090f50.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf that case, in my opinion, you should use scene text detection to crop each text in the scene image, and then use this code to recognize each cropped text image.\r\n\r\nBest","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/510330173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2477740832,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ3Nzc0MDgzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2477740832","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-12T02:29:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/516331846","html_url":"https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/24#issuecomment-516331846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/24","id":516331846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjMzMTg0Ng==","user":{"login":"Crescentz","id":35165563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTY1NTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35165563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz","html_url":"https://github.com/Crescentz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Crescentz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T09:00:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T09:00:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"can
