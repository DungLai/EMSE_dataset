\r\nThank you so much.\r\nI am working on the recognition part for Japanese. My model accuracy is low, says ~60% on the testing image(real-world image), I applied CRAFT for text detection beforehand.  In this case, I always wonder whether the low performance comes from:\r\n1. Not having enough synthetic data or\r\n2. The model is too complex while the number of words used for training is small(my toy project has just around 150 words and I have generated around 7500 synthetic images, use only 1 font and 3 backgrounds, added noise such as Gaussian, median filter, sharpen, smooth. The images are cropped by the word length).\r\n\r\nShould I generate more synthetic data or reduce the complexity of the model instead. May I ask what would you do in this situation? \r\nMy model uses configuration as below: Transformation None --FeatureExtraction VGG --SequenceModeling BiLSTM --Prediction

\r\nThanks a lot for your help. I tried your suggestions and it helps me improve the accuracy significantly. \r\nI only have one more question. Since I am creating synthetic data to predict only 150 sentences, I have created exactly the same 150 sentences for synthetic data but with different fonts and backgrounds. \r\nThe model after being trained performs well on two separate sentences(as expected), but when the image contains two sentences, it could not. \r\nFor example: if predicting image A(シャウエッセン) and image B(御堂筋事件) separately, the accuracy is 100%, when it comes to predicting image C (シャウエッセン 御堂筋事件), it failed. \r\nI think the reason may come from using RNN model (BiLSTM), \"御堂筋事件\" has never been learned to stay after \"シャウエッセン\". \r\n![imageA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23737687/60409589-717c3d00-9bee-11e9-9500-d292bf9a6bfa.png) \r\npredicted: シャウエッセン\r\nactual:

question is, when generating synthetic data, in the case of English recognization, each synthetic image has one word, it can be \"school\", \"teacher\" or \"student\"..etc. But in the case of Japanese, words are not separated by the white space as it is in English, how do you generate synthetic data from the corpus of Japanese? \r\nSorry for keep commenting on this issue.
