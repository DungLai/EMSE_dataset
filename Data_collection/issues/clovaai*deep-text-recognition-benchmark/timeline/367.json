Maybe I'm doing something wrong\r\nor it could be the dimension of images? Have I to prepare a dataset of images with a fixed size?\r\n\r\nThank you all!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/1339101504/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"riccardoregnicoli","id":115144036,"node_id":"U_kgDOBtz1ZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115144036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli","html_url":"https://github.com/riccardoregnicoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardoregnicoli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
