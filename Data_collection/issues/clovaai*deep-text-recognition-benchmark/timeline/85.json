[length filtering](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/blob/3c2c89a88ad4f88690dce170225dfe05a0234dd5/dataset.py#L163-L166): the images whose `len(label) > batch_max_length(=default is 25)`\r\n1.

Add `[UNK]` token, change below\r\nhttps://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/blob/3c2c89a88ad4f88690dce170225dfe05a0234dd5/utils.py#L108\r\nto `list_token = ['[GO]', '[s]', '[UNK]']`\r\n1. change below\r\nhttps://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/blob/3c2c89a88ad4f88690dce170225dfe05a0234dd5/utils.py#L136\r\nto `text = [self.dict[char] if char in self.dict else self.dict['[UNK]'] for char in text]`\r\n\r\nIf you do not use the character filtering part and use `[UNK]` token, you should comment out [these lines](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/blob/d38c3cbfdb0c3db952d1cf866db9c6473ffc5f04/dataset.py#L212-L214) also.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\nBest","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/538849843/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":35,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2690586457,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY5MDU4NjQ1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2690586457","actor":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-07T05:53:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/538860149","html_url":"https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/85#issuecomment-538860149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/85","id":538860149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODg2MDE0OQ==","user":{"login":"xxxpsyduck","id":16136458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM2NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16136458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck","html_url":"https://github.com/xxxpsyduck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T06:41:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T06:41:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank for the reply.
