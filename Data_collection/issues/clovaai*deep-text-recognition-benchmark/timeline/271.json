My solution is to change the two occurences of `re.search` in `dataset.py` to the following:\r\n```\r\n                    temp_char = re.escape(self.opt.character)\r\n                    out_of_char = f'[^{temp_char}]'\r\n                    if re.search(out_of_char, label):\r\n                        continue\r\n```\r\nThis ensures that special characters are treated as normal. One potential downside is that it adds \\\\ before all non-alphanumeric characters (before python 3.7), which introduces \\ to your character set if it doesn't already exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/857975719/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zehua-jerry-yu","id":60247777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMjQ3Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60247777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu","html_url":"https://github.com/zehua-jerry-yu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zehua-jerry-yu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
