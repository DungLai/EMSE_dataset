If I'm using my own dataset to train the model do I still need the MJSynth Dataset? if not what do I need to use for --select_data?\r\n\r\nNo, you don't have to use MJSynth Dataset then. When using your own dataset, for --select_data flag, you will pass '/', which indicates that you'll be using all the data inside the train and test folders you have provided.
