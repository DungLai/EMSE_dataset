You probably don't want to do that all with just machine learning. Te space between words makes it very hard to read. What you can do is combine ML with just normal openCV stuff and keep track of the location of each textbox (word) that gets extracted with your text-detection network (probably CRAFT) and then order the results from left to right with a certain height variance to the most left textbox so that you find all textboxes which are on the line that you are reading from left to right. Then read all the textboxes with OCR and append the results to eachother with a space between them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/694079270/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YacobBY","id":30029456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDI5NDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30029456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY","html_url":"https://github.com/YacobBY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YacobBY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3776732396,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc3NjczMjM5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/3776732396","actor":{"login":"vanchung1995","id":15941200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQxMjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15941200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995","html_url":"https://github.com/vanchung1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-17T08:23:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3776732400,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NzY3MzI0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/3776732400","actor":{"login":"vanchung1995","id":15941200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQxMjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15941200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995","html_url":"https://github.com/vanchung1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanchung1995/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-17T08:23:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/768876767","html_url":"https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/197#issuecomment-768876767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/197","id":768876767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODg3Njc2Nw==","user":{"login":"kimlia545","id":72369991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzY5OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72369991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545","html_url":"https://github.com/kimlia545","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimlia545/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}
