Then you can compare the median confidence scores for each run and keep the predictions from the run with the highest median score.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/562813895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michaeltremeer","id":12974372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc0Mzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12974372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer","html_url":"https://github.com/michaeltremeer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeltremeer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3167032608,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE2NzAzMjYwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/3167032608","actor":{"login":"xxxpsyduck","id":16136458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM2NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16136458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck","html_url":"https://github.com/xxxpsyduck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxxpsyduck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T07:40:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
