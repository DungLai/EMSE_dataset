For simplicity, most recent STR methods have focused on horizontal texts, and this work also follows the scheme; leaving the problem as a future work (see Section 4.5).\r\n\r\nUsing this framework, you may train your own model on vertical texts (by rotating it, for example). However, horizontal and vertical texts have different characteristics. Therefore, it can be harder to get a good model that achieves high performance on both.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/508817675/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kdrl","id":16129405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTI5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16129405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl","html_url":"https://github.com/kdrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdrl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2463220991,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ2MzIyMDk5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2463220991","actor":{"login":"mathpopo","id":21274466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjc0NDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21274466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo","html_url":"https://github.com/mathpopo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T17:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2463220992,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NjMyMjA5OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/events/2463220992","actor":{"login":"mathpopo","id":21274466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjc0NDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21274466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo","html_url":"https://github.com/mathpopo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathpopo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-05T17:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/comments/509087082","html_url":"https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/21#issuecomment-509087082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/21","id":509087082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTA4NzA4Mg==","user":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T05:45:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T05:45:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mathpopo
