During the data processing , i have some confusion below.\r\n1. Should i **Normalize the data into same size** to get better result??\r\n2. The textflow in datasets combined with vertical and horizontal , should i **Rotate them into same direction** ?\r\n\r\nby the way, i would choose **TRBA (TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn)** for train.\r\n\r\ni don't have too much base knowledge about deep learning, thank for reply !!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
