I am planning to collect some MRZ data which is of 44 characters and train the model. I initially fine tuned the pre trained model with 1k MRZ data and results were not great. I assume that dataset is not big enough. Any suggestions on how i can go head ? Should i retrain only the prediction layer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NavaneethanRajasekaran","id":41910620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTEwNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41910620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran","html_url":"https://github.com/NavaneethanRajasekaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NavaneethanRajasekaran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
