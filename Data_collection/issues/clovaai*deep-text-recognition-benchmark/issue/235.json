I am confusing because to the best of my knowledge, the current recognizer will extract, model sequences, ... from left to right and vice versa but for vertical text lines, it should be from top to bottom.\r\n- For non-Latin languages like Chinese, should I recognize each character or whole text line? Which choice do researchers usually make?\r\n+ If I build a model for recognizing Chinese words, then does sequence modeling model like BiDirectional LSTM have any affect on the performance (because Chinese word is not a sequence of characters, I guess!)?\r\n+ If I build a model for recognizing Chinese text lines, then what if space between words is long?\r\n- Number of Chinese word classes is much larger than number of Latin character classes (26)? How to deal with it?\r\nI have been struggling with these questions for a long time, so it will be awesome to receive your feedback!!!\r\nOnce again, thank you for your work!!!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
