I am a novice and found sth i cannot understand:\r\n\r\nThe ```AttnLabelConverter``` encodes the labels into ```text, length```. The ```text``` has shape ```[batch_size, max_length+2]``` where '2' means [go] and [stop].\r\n\r\nWhen the ```text``` pass into ```Attention.forward()```, however, the notes said ```text : the text-index of each image. [batch_size x (max_length+1)]. +1 for [GO] token. text[:, 0] = [GO].```\r\n\r\nAre these two ```text``` the same object? If so, why the shape is different? \r\nThanks for you help!","closed_by":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/38/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
