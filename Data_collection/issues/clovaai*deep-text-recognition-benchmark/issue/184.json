I wonder how do you address the ReCTS dataset? Because their gt file format is like this:\r\n```\r\n{\"chars\": [{\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"H\", \"points\": [25, 175, 112, 175, 112, 286, 25, 286]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"O\", \"points\": [102, 182, 210, 182, 210, 273, 102, 273]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"K\", \"points\": [201, 185, 293, 185, 293, 285, 201, 285]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"I\", \"points\": [283, 180, 328, 180, 328, 288, 283, 288]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"T\", \"points\": [367, 182, 468, 182, 468, 295, 367, 295]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"E\", \"points\": [452, 201, 515, 201, 515, 294, 452, 294]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"A\", \"points\": [509, 191, 619, 191, 619, 293, 509, 293]}], \"lines\": [{\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"HOKI\", \"points\": [23, 173, 327, 180, 327, 290, 23, 283]}, {\"ignore\": 0, \"transcription\": \"TEA\", \"points\": [368, 180, 621, 180, 621, 294, 368, 294]}]}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut following your README.md, if I want to train the ReCTS dataset by myself, my `gt.txt` should be like this:\r\n```\r\ntest/word_1.png Tiredness\r\ntest/word_2.png kills\r\ntest/word_3.png A\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you mean an image corresponds to a label, what should I do with it?","closed_by":{"login":"Eurus-Holmes","id":34226570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjI2NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34226570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes","html_url":"https://github.com/Eurus-Holmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eurus-Holmes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
