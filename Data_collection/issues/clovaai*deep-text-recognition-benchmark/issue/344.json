Please help ! Or should i train the model from scratch using non-latin characters ?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother question is : after creating the dataset .mdb files i have to replace the datasets from validation folder also ?\r\n\r\nThis is confusing, we create the training model python3 create_lmdb_dataset.py --inputPath data/ --gtFile data/gt.txt --outputPath result/\r\n\r\nBut what about the validation datasets?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
