The strings are 20-character long, and consist of mixed capital and numeric numbers. The recognition error include incorrect # of characters (missing characters or more than 20 characters) as well as wrongly recognized characters/numbers.\r\n\r\nOne option is to split the long string into 2+ sub-strings.  Any other options such as tuning parameters to improve recognition directly so we don't have to split strings?
