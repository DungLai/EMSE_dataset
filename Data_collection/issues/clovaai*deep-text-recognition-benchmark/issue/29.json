I'm currently trying to train a fast model, so I'm trying to train ResNet + CTC and VGG + CTC on my own. Using the default setting from your training script, I just wonder how long does the training take to reach ~70% Accuracy as shown in Table 8?\r\n\r\nBy the way, have you tried out using MobileNet-V2 as the backbone? Using the provided settings it seems I can't get MobileNet-V2 + CTC pass ~40% accuracy.
