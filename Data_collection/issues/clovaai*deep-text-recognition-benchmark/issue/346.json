I am confused about the way to train the model.\r\nSo, if I want the model to recognize both printed characters and handwritings, do I need to train both printed and handwriting characters at the same time? Or should I train them separately? \r\nThis is my first time training the OCR model, so please help me in details if possible.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance! \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
