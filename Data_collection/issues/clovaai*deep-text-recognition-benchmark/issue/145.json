But when the character list has more than 64 char, i get the following errors:\r\n`Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  \r\nFile \"train.py\", line 332, in <module>\r\n    train(opt)\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 82, in train\r\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.saved_model), strict=False)\r\n  File \"/home/khanhnt/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py\", line 839, in load_state_dict\r\n    self.__class__.__name__, \"\\n\\t\".join(error_msgs)))\r\nRuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for DataParallel:\r\n\tsize mismatch for module.Prediction.attention_cell.rnn.weight_ih: copying a param with shape torch.Size([1024, 352]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([1024, 353]).\r\n\tsize mismatch for module.Prediction.generator.weight: copying a param with shape torch.Size([96, 256]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([97, 256]).\r\n\tsize mismatch for module.Prediction.generator.bias: copying a param with shape torch.Size([96]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([97]).\r\n`\r\nHere is the command I have used to fine-tune:\r\n\r\n`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py --train_data result/train_27022020/train/ --valid_data result/train_27022020/valid/ --Transformation TPS --FeatureExtraction ResNet --SequenceModeling BiLSTM --Prediction Attn  --sensitive --FT --saved_model model/TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn-case-sensitive_15000.pth --batch_size 82`\r\n\r\nI have tried several solution that you and the others recommended, for examle [(Load with model.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.saved_model), strict=False))](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/73#issuecomment-535858700); [make character list file](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/85#issuecomment-538889138) but non of them can make it work. Do you have any recommendation for me. Do I need to retrain the model from scraft ?\r\n Thank a lot.
