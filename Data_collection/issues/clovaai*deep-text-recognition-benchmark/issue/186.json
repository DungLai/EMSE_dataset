My dataset contains about 88k images of words and labels. And once I saw that the model was training only on 40k images. The problem was my alphabet contain the special symbols, e.g. ][?!*^. As I saw later, part of the data was skipped, when data was loading. The reason is how works --data_filtering_off. It uses re.search function with pattern ```f[^{opt.character}]```. And when you use the alphabet with special symbols for a regular expression, your data can be skipped. You also can't add '\\\\' for any special symbols because then you have more num_classes than it be.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
