I have downloaded datasets from [MJSynth](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/) and [SynthText](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/). Also, I have my own dataset for training that consists of ~300 images. In order to train the model, I have to run this script as the article states:\r\n`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py \\\r\n--train_data my_dataset/training --valid_data my_dataset/validation \\\r\n--select_data MJ-ST --batch_ratio 0.5-0.5 \\\r\n--Transformation TPS --FeatureExtraction ResNet --SequenceModeling BiLSTM --Prediction Attn`\r\nBut I have some problems with organizing directories.
