If I only swap some characters, like '^' -> '£' , everything is still fine.\r\n\r\nIs there any simple way to copy the model and only expand the number of target classes, to avoid loosing all the information learned during pre training ? Should I simply reinitialize the attention layer ?\r\n\r\nOtherwise I understand I'll have to train from scratch with my custom character list.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any additional information.\r\n\r\nThanks again for this amazing software !\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/111/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
