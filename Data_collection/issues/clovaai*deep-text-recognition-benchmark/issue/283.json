I am planning to collect some MRZ data which is of 44 characters and train the model. I initially fine tuned the pre trained model with 1k MRZ data and results were not great. I assume that dataset is not big enough. Any suggestions on how i can go head ? Should i retrain only the prediction layer? Please suggest\r\n![passort example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41910620/120519089-df8b9900-c3ef-11eb-98ed-14d3f9c52896.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
