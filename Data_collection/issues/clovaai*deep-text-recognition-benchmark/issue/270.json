The default lr is set to 1., which seems to be quite high. What lr is suggested for fine-tuning? \r\n\r\nMoreover, is it recommended to fine-tune on cut out single digits/characters or on complete images? \r\n\r\nMy last question is about the input parameters concerning the image width/height. The default parameters are 100/32. Is it recommended to adjust this during the fine-tuning step? My fine-tuning dataset is of size 64x64, should i adjust the parameters to 64x64 accordingly?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
