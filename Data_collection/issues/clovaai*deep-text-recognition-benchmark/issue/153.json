I am wondering how can you apply CRAFT as preprocessing? Do you train these two models jointly? Or just use CRAFT pretrained model's inference as preprocessing?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/153/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
