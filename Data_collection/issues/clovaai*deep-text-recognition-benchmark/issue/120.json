I set the image width as 280. And the width of training data of chinese is all 280, but the training data of english is like yours as MJ.\r\nHowever, the width of the output chinese text image of CRAFT is usually more than 280, and the english text image of Craft is less than 280. So the recognition accuracy for the real chinese document is very low. So can I solve this problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
