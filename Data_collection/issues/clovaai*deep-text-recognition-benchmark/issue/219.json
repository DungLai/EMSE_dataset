However, I am stuck in a point where the recognizer does not seem to give better results and I want to train my own model with my own data. My own data would consist in a set of image of extremely low resolution (about 20x40 or so) as they are character (numbers/letters) images, not words. Luckly, all the characters I want to recognize look similar, i.e. similar fonts and size. These are examples of images I would like to recognize:\r\n\r\n![5_train](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37656547/92721459-6da58800-f366-11ea-9ba4-b1e6c900fdeb.jpg)\r\n![3_train](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37656547/92721461-6e3e1e80-f366-11ea-980a-c0f75158760d.jpg)\r\n![4_train](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37656547/92721463-6e3e1e80-f366-11ea-89df-47820a7cc5de.jpg)\r\n\r\nas \"3, U, 7\".\r\n\r\nThe approach I think I am going to use is fine tuning the pretrained model TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn-case-sensitive.pth:\r\n\r\n -> in this case, I wonder how many images per kind of character should I use? I really need this info.\r\n-> if I only train for some digits (for example, for digits \"1\" and \"7\" as they are often confused), can the rest of my letters/digit get worse?\r\n-> would it be good if a use my own data + a public char recognition dataset such as: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/ ? I think it would be easier for me as I don't have so many data,\r\n-> maybe is it better to train from scratch with my own data + char74k?\r\n\r\nHope someone can guide me a bit. Btw, congratulations for both respositories, they are pretty good!\r\n\r\nAna \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
