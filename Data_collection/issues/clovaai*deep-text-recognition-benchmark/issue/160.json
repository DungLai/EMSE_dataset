Since the contrast of my cropped image was low\r\nSo I increased the contrast through some OpenCV technique. \r\nThen I'm using your model to recognize the text part, But could not get good results.\r\nHere I'm attaching some example data.\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32773256/79904648-a3d38100-8432-11ea-9189-8633513cb872.jpg)\r\n![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32773256/79904749-d0879880-8432-11ea-96b5-b1ac4a891711.jpg)\r\n![100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32773256/79904779-df6e4b00-8432-11ea-96fd-07d222241fb9.jpg)\r\n\r\n> Predicted result for the first image is **16300060a**\r\n> For the second image is **f348558840**\r\n> And for the third one, it's **f348652877**\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest some ways to improve the results as I need more accurate texts for my purpose?\r\nThanks.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
