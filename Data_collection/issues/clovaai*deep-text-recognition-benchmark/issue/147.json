You did really a good job.\r\n\r\nI need to do transfer learning to train the model with a small dataset of mine and in the meantime I have low computation power so that I can't train the model with large datasets that authors have used. So far I could get good results with current pretrained models but I would like to test my dataset with CTC and more importantly with RGB configs to see if I can get any improvements.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone have already trained the model with CTC-case-sensitive or RGB-Attn-case-sensitive config that could share it? In short, following pretrained models are really useful to be shared with public:\r\n\r\n**TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn-case-sensitive-RGB.pth\r\nTPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-CTC-case-sensitive.pth\r\nTPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-CTC-case-sensitive-RGB.pth**","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/147/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
