I am currently training with None-VGG-BiLSTM-CTC to be used with easyocr. i have a training dataset of 800 and a validation dataset of 200 generated by a script which creates varying background and font color. During training, the validation accuracy starts to go up at around 600 iterations and steadily increase to about 80+% after 1000 iterations however when i used it in the demo.py or in easyocr on some of the images from the same validation dataset that is being used during training, it gives random result that does not even come close to the actual word. I am new to AI and machine learning in general, any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThings ive tried:\r\n1) changing valInterval(increasing and decreasing)\r\n2) batch-size(from 192 to 32)\r\n3) imgW and imgH\r\n\r\nBelow is my opt.txt for the training\r\n\r\n------------ Options -------------\r\nexp_name: None-VGG-BiLSTM-CTC-Seed1111\r\ntrain_data: result/train\r\nvalid_data: result/test\r\nmanualSeed: 1111\r\nworkers: 4\r\nbatch_size: 32\r\nnum_iter: 300000\r\nvalInterval: 50\r\nsaved_model: \r\nFT: False\r\nadam: False\r\nlr: 1\r\nbeta1: 0.9\r\nrho: 0.95\r\neps: 1e-08\r\ngrad_clip: 5\r\nbaiduCTC: False\r\nselect_data: ['/']\r\nbatch_ratio: ['1']\r\ntotal_data_usage_ratio: 1.0\r\nbatch_max_length: 34\r\nimgH: 64\r\nimgW: 600\r\nrgb: False\r\ncharacter: 0123456789!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ â‚¬ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\r\nsensitive: False\r\nPAD: False\r\ndata_filtering_off: False\r\nTransformation: None\r\nFeatureExtraction: VGG\r\nSequenceModeling: BiLSTM\r\nPrediction: CTC\r\nnum_fiducial: 20\r\ninput_channel: 1\r\noutput_channel: 256\r\nhidden_size: 256\r\nnum_gpu: 1\r\nnum_class: 97\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
