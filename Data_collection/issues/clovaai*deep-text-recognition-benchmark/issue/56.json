You've done a good job!\r\n\r\nHere's my question, I've retrained the model with the option as:\r\n\"--select_data MJ-ST --batch_ratio 0.5-0.5 --Transformation None --FeatureExtraction VGG --SequenceModeling BiLSTM --Prediction CTC\"\r\n, corresponding to the original version of CRNN. The rest parameters are set as default and the model is trained on MJ and ST datasets.\r\n\r\nHowever, when testing with my local retrained best_accuracy model, the result accuracy is shown as below:\r\nin IC13_857: only 88.45%  while  **91.1%** in paper.\r\nin IC13_1015: 87.68%  while **89.2%** in paper.\r\nin IC15_1811: 66.37% while **69.4%** in paper.\r\nin IC15_2077: 64.07% while **64.2%** in paper.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is still something inappropriate in my retraining process. Should I reset the learning rate or expand my training iteration? Do you guys have any idea about improving the performance to align with the public results illustrated in the paper?\r\n\r\nAnd I've attempted to train only on MJ dataset, whose model seems to have a higher accuracy in IC13_857. When I extend the training on both MJ and ST, is it necessary to add up the iteration number, so that I can get a better accuracy?\r\n\r\nExpect for your reply ^_^\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
