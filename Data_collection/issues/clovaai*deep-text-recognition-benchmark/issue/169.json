However, when ocr recognizes the text images, which are low-resolution images and unclear text texture. should ocr model keeping those images as the color image (rgb)  learning or converting them into the gray image. Do you think the color image may provide much more information in this case of low-resolution image recognition?  \r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
