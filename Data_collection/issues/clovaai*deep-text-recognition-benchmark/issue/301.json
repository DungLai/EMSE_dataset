I am somewhat new to this so any advice would be appreciated. The IDs are in Arabic. So what I want to know is how to do the fine tuning of the model? from what I understand, the model will only train on the training data I have, but I want a model that already gives good predictions for Arabic and fine tune that for the use case I mentioned above. Also, my line of thinking is that I can crop the words and numbers from my IDs where each word and number will be used for training. Is this the best approach, especially for Arabic?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"amroghoneim","id":37261960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjYxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37261960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim","html_url":"https://github.com/amroghoneim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amroghoneim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
