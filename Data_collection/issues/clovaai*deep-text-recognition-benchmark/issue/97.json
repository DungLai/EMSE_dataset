Thank you for your great project. I am trying training None-ResNet-BiLSTM-CTC model with my own training data. However, I founded that the performance is not good when there is any space between characters. Then I think I should add the SPACE to the character sets (current is \"01234...abc...ABC.../\\:!~\"). Do you have any suggestions for this problem? If I want to add SPACE to char sets then how can I do, just \" 0123..\" or any special way?\r\nBelow is a nice result from your online demo. Do you add SPACE to charsets?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42860711/67452901-eb797b80-f64e-11e9-879a-f78292c9e8b3.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.
