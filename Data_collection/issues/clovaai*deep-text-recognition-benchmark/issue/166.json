I go through \"When you need to train on your own dataset or Non-Latin language datasets.\" post in which for the generation of new data is by calling a \"create_lmdb_dataset.py\" file by supplying two inputs, path for data and path for ground truth. But I can't understand what this data folder contains? is it a set of natural images containing a text or it's simple \"empty\" folder. and on what basis I can generate ground truth? \r\n\r\nI need to create a database containing digit along with character with a format like \"Arial\", \"MICR\" etc. \r\n\r\nI have .ttf file for all fonts with me by using those fonts I would like to generate the dataset which will further use for transfer learning.\r\n\r\nPlease guide me.
