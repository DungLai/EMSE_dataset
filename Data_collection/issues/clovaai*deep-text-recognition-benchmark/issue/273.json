I created the dataset as described within the README, but unfortunately the prediction for each item within a batch is always the same. I mean literally the same - the confidence score for each image is identical, and the network converges towards the most common character. I already tried to change the learning rate. Training a model by scratch results in the same behavior. Does anyone know, why this is the case? Do I have to preprocess my images or anything?
