I have used the pre trained model \"TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn.pth\" for text recognition. I need help with detecting special characters. For instance, in a word \"www.ab-c@css.com\" the special characters like '.' , '@', '-' are not detected in the output. i tried both Attn and CTC as prediction modes. Also i tried changing the argument character, i was getting below error\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for DataParallel:\r\n\tsize mismatch for module.Prediction.attention_cell.rnn.weight_ih: copying a param with shape torch.Size([1024, 294]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([1024, 307]).\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"ku21fan","id":7953971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTM5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan","html_url":"https://github.com/ku21fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ku21fan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
