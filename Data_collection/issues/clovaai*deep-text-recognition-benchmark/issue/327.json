For the text file (gt.txt): how can I write the \"\\n\" to make a training dataset? The structure of the file does not seem to allow me to detect on several lines\r\n\r\nQ. The characters that can be detected are only alphanumeric. I need to recognize special characters (like : /,*,#, ...). Do I have to train the model for these characters too?\r\n\r\nQ. Your code to create a LMDB dataset for training can surely be used to create datasets for Test and for Validation?\r\n\r\nThank you very much guys for your help!!!
