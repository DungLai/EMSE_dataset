After a while I could not managed how to use the Attention_sensitive_characters network correctly. \r\nAll characters are usually read, but repeated characters appears quite often, without clear explanation.\r\nAfter few investigations, I think this is due to an internal libtorch issue on the Attention part.\r\nIndeed, the results are great with the CTC version of your network, and I think i've missed nothing trying to translate your Attention_converter from Python to C++.\r\nFurthermore, CTC version is a bit faster, and this is more convenient.\r\n\r\nI'm now trying to move to a special character sensitive version (include non alpha-numeric characters) of the CTC. Have you already done the pretrained models for such a network ? The only special characters sensitive model i've found is for Attention.\r\n\r\nIf not, I'll make my own learning.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your sharing,\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
