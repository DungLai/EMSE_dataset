However, the output of LSTM layer doesn't seem to be suitable, from what I know, to apply embedding.\r\n\r\nCould you please explain me why it is a good practise to use embedding in that situation and why it is improving results ?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/142/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/issues/142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
