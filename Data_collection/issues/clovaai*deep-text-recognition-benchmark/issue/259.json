I would be thankful if you could find a time to answer.\r\nMy questions are following:\r\n- What was the benifit of changing the **ResNet** output to `width_heght = 26x1 and 25x1 `\r\n- Should I modify the output of another feature extractor network to `26x1 or 25x1`?\r\n- Can I use EfficientNet for to get better results.
