The versions from the `typing` module are soon-to-be deprecated as per [PEP 585](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/).\r\n\r\nShould be an easy fix; just replace every instance of `typing.List` and `typing.Tuple` with `list` and `tuple`. Maybe there are some more generics in the typing module that will need to be replaced as well.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1626\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-01 at 10 46 13 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12386450/139690391-df1e2e9d-ff8a-4747-86b5-50b37739b964.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/870/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
