Connected component analysis\r\n   - check for it, report result \r\n   - if unconnected, report nodes not in LCC\r\n   - could show adjacency matrix, where nodes grouped by CC, but not sure if this is worth it \r\n2. Adjacency matrix\r\n   - normal\r\n   - log transformed \r\n   - PTRed\r\n   - (if node categories) plot adjacency where nodes are grouped (like elegans L/R)\r\n3. Degree and edge weight\r\n   - Plot distribution of node degrees \r\n   - (if weighted) Plot distribution of all edge weights\r\n   - (lf node categories) plot the above when grouped by category\r\n4. Embedding\r\n   - ASE (raw, PTR o DiagAug) pairplot\r\n   - ASE scree \r\n   - LSE (which type, or show both?) (raw, PTR) pairplot\r\n   - LSE scree \r\n   - (if node categories) color embeddings by category\r\n5. Clustering? \r\n   - run GMM on the embeddings above\r\n   - plot BIC by n_clusters\r\n   - (if node categories) plot ARI by n_clusters \r\n   - for best fit, show pairplot where colors are by predicted cluster\r\n   - or, could plot original data with ellipses for each GMM cluster\r\n\r\n**Multiple graph**\r\n1. Union/Intersection of connected component analysis \r\n   - same as 1 above \r\n2. Adjacency matrix\r\n   - same as 1 above \r\n   - Gridplot as well\r\n3. Degree and edge weights\r\n   - same as 3 above, but color by graph \r\n4. Embedding \r\n   - Omni (raw, PTR, Center o DiagAug o PTR) pairplot \r\n   - Omni scree\r\n   - color embeddings by graph \r\n5. Clustering? \r\n   - \r\n\r\n**Other thoughts** \r\n - Throw in node2vec embeddings as well just to compare? \r\n - run stats on any of the edge weight, degree distributions by default? \r\n - worth running anything like semipar in an EDA setting? \r\n - @jovo @j1c  thoughts?
