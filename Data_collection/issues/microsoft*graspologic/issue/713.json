Looks like the issue is in the loop [here](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/graspologic/simulations/simulations.py#L578).  \r\n\r\nI wonder if it's possible to vectorize to speed this loop up? or possibly do some calculations differently, or even (if other options don't work) parralelize?\r\n\r\nanother option is to use [cython](https://cython.org/) here, but not sure how worth it that is... sklearn uses the crap out of cython to speed up their stuff though, and I'm sure it'd be useful in other places besides just this function? thoughts?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now it's going way faster, so maybe the problem was just on my machine.
