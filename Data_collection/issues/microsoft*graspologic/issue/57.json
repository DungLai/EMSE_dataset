Currently, I have 133 subjects, each one with 249 brain regions of interest timeseries. For each subject, I compute the pearson correlation matrix, so in the end I have a matrix [133 x 249 x 249] (if you prefer, 133 graphs with 249 vertices).\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run:\r\n```python\r\nembeddings = OmnibusEmbed(k=20).fit_transform(correlations)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`embeddings` becomes a 2-items tuple, with two matrices [33117 x 20], in which `np.allclose(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])` is `True`. Why is it returning two of them?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it safe to reshape the matrix [33117 x 20] into [133 x 249 x 20], in a way that embeddings[0] contains the embeddings of the subject 0`s regions? \r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
