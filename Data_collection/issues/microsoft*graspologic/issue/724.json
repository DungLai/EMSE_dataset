Please describe.\r\nWe recently added some code for plotting matrices with metadata (see matrixplot and adjplot). There are some issues I already know about, including: \r\n- [ ] the brackets that are drawn to indicate \"grouping\" don't look great, and are missing the last tick for example.\r\n- [ ] there is no option to move or turn off the large labels corresponding to \"group\" and \"color\" arguments. i also think these labels should be on the margins by default instead of taking up space on the top and side.\r\n- [ ] the structure of the code should most likely have a class representation on the inside like seaborn's clustermap. there are far too many parameters floating around. i also think returning a lightweight class would be more convenient because the functions create a complicated group of axes, dividers, etc.\r\n- [ ] I have a new application where I'd like to specify colors for the edges - this could get super complicated so not sure if worth doing. could consider an option where one can pass in multiple arguments to \"data\" and their treated like multigraphs\r\n- [ ] I have new code to plot dendrograms on the margins of the adjacency matrices which would be good to include.\r\n- [ ] Need to be able to pass in a title easily \r\n- [ ] Need to change the \"color\" arguments to \"colors\" to match seaborn as well as allow one to pass \"color\" to color the edges themselves. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
