I think it makes more sense to store them as `n_graphs, n_vertices, n_embedded_dim)`.\r\n\r\nWhen computing `fit_transform`, we should return a tensor with shape `(n_graphs, n_vertices, n_embedded_dim)`.\r\n\r\n## Template Code\r\n```GraSPy\r\nP = np.array([\r\n    [0.7, .2, .1], \r\n    [.2, .3, .2],\r\n    [.1, .2, .05]\r\n])\r\nn = [50, 50, 50]\r\nA = [sbm(n, P) for _ in range(10)]\r\n\r\nomni = OmnibusEmbed()\r\nxhats = omni.fit_transform(A)\r\nprint(xhats.shape)\r\n>>>> (1500, 2)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
