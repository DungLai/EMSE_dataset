I read through a few github issues about this and did not see anything about alt text for figures specifically, but I could easily have missed it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
