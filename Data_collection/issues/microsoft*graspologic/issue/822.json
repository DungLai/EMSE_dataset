Please describe.\r\nI'm on a M1 Mac and trying to install graspologic. However, the pip install is pretty buggy for me in general, and so conda usually is the way to go to install things with numba/cython/etc. dependencies. Is there the possibility of having a conda release as well as a pypi release?\r\n\r\nHowever, when installing, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(mnex64) adam2392@Adams-MBP-2 graspologic % pip install graspologic\r\nRequirement already satisfied: graspologic in /Users/adam2392/miniforge3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/graspologic-0.3.0-py3.9.egg (0.3.0)\r\nCollecting anytree>=2.8.0\r\n  Using cached anytree-2.8.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (41 kB)\r\nCollecting beartype>=0.7.1\r\n  Using cached beartype-0.8.0-py3-none-any.whl (455 kB)\r\nCollecting gensim<=3.9.0,>=3.8.0\r\n  Using cached gensim-3.8.3.tar.gz (23.4 MB)\r\nCollecting graspologic\r\n  Using cached graspologic-0.2.0.tar.gz (5.1 MB)\r\n  Installing build dependencies ... done\r\n  Getting requirements to build wheel ... done\r\n  Installing backend dependencies ... done\r\n    Preparing wheel metadata ... done\r\n  Using cached graspologic-0.1.0.tar.gz (5.1 MB)\r\n  Installing build dependencies ... done\r\n  Getting requirements to build wheel ... done\r\n  Installing backend dependencies ... done\r\n    Preparing wheel metadata ... done\r\nERROR: Cannot install graspologic==0.1.0, graspologic==0.2.0 and graspologic==0.3.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe conflict is caused by:\r\n    graspologic 0.3.0 depends on graspologic-native>=1.0.0\r\n    graspologic 0.2.0 depends on graspologic-native\r\n    graspologic 0.1.0 depends on graspologic-native\r\n\r\nTo fix this you could try to:\r\n1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified\r\n2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'm not exactly sure what the problem is, but if there is a conda build then that would alleviate this issue I think.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
