Please describe.\r\nCurrently, GMM returns the model that maximizes BIC. Sometimes it is desirable to have more expensive (i.e. more parameters) models. In these cases, less harsh parameter penalties should be used (i.e. AIC where the penalty is not a function of the number of parameters in the model).\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdding an keyword argument `penalty` (or something) to GMM fit function with BIC, AIC, etc as options and BIC as the default.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nNone.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hhelm10","id":31412718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDEyNzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31412718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10","html_url":"https://github.com/hhelm10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhelm10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
