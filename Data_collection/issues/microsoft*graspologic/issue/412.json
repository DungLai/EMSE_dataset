In an effort to remedy this I uninstalled scikit-learn and reinstalled it with version 0.19.2. But I get a new error in the install saying my python version is too high to be compatible. \r\n\r\nI set up the conda environment using \"conda create --name ndd\". I then went to install all the dependencies Python 3.8.5, scipy-1.5.0, scikit-learn-0.23.2(and then subsequently  0.19.2.) , networkx-2.5, pandas-1.1.1, numpy-1.19.1.
