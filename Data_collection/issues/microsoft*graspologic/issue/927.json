Please describe.\r\n\r\nZG2 is not perfect, and sometimes goes awry. It feels like it would be reasonable to allow users to at least have exposed to them the singular values, so they can reasonably decide whether the singular value chosen for the cutoff was a reasonable choice by ZG. Alternatively, since the laplacian is an internal calculation, one could feasibly just set self.L_norm = L_norm after computing the laplacian of the adjacency matrix, and let the user do whatever they want with the representation of the network before it is embedded.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
