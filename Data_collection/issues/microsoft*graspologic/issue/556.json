We should consider providing graphs in all of our embed functions as being `Union[np.ndarray, nx.Graph, nx.DiGraph]` and then using adjacency matrices everywhere internally.  `topologic` took the other route from graspy, which is it always required a networkx Graph object, but it converted them all to adjacency matrices immediately (except for node2vec, which is amusingly the feature that is spurring this conversation for me), but really we should be able to handle all of the above, and our embeddings should probably be written over adjacency matrices only.\r\n\r\nWe also want to talk about our scikit-isms on these - it took me longer than it should have to figure out that we were doing `fit` for almost no reason, but `fit_transform` was the one to use - on ase and lse (the classes, that is).  It's my understanding OOS adds some new reasons for it, which would be great, but I just want to make sure we're not doing things \"Just Because\".  I'm not entirely convinced it ever makes sense to have separate fit/transform functions on node2vec, though maybe I still don't understand it well enough to see that.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
