Please describe.\r\nCurrently in reference tab in docs, it looks like \r\n\r\nReference\r\n|\r\n|_____ Module 1\r\n|         |____ Topic 1\r\n|         |____ Topic 2\r\n|\r\n|_____ Module 2\r\n|         |____ Topic 1\r\n|         |____ Topic 2\r\n...\r\n\r\nSo none of the actual classes/functions can be seen in the TOC.\r\n\r\nI dislike this.

I'd be okay with removing the intermediate categorizations that don't correspond to an actual module or anything like that.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nSome libraries have something like [this](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/py-modindex.html) or [this](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/genindex.html)\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nSeems related to #119\r\nIs a solution to something I think @jovo was complaining about.\r\n\r\nWould like to hear opinions on this.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
