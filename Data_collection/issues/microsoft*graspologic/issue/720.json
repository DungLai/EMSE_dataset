We're going to have issues going forward and little fixes here and there are realistically only going to buy us a little time before we have future problems.\r\n\r\n## Current State\r\nRight now we use RTD to generate our reference documentation.  It generates our reference docs for every branch on our repo.\r\n\r\nWe use Github actions to generate our tutorial documentation.  On merge to `dev` we automatically publish the one and only version of our tutorial documentation in a place that is navigable by a web browser.  Our tutorials and reference documentation can't be tightly linked (in the sense that things may be relocated and we can't have anything in place that ensures they continue exist and we don't have any broken links).  We also don't publish the latest release of our latest current final release - instead we publish what's on the bleeding edge by publishing dev only.\r\n\r\n## Requests of this Feature\r\n- Allow us to build reference documentation (fast) or both reference and tutorial documentation (slower). The goal here is to be able to quickly validate our pydoc reference docs are building correctly with or without the tutorials being built.  This may not be possible as we may be in a chicken and egg scenario, but it would be nice if we could say \"do a full documentation build\" as well as \"do the fast reference documentation only build\" for local development purposes.\r\n- Each release - whether full release (merge to main) or pre release (merge to dev) should have a full documentation suite built from it, and this documentation suite should be published to a website of some sort for us to see.\r\n- @bdpedigo edit - build previews linked in each PR like netlify used to do. These make reviewing code changes that affect docs much easier\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, we cannot build our documentation and have RTD host it as-is. Perhaps that is something we can do with another service?\r\n\r\nThings we can explore:\r\n- a graspologic documentation repository (meaning that the graspologic ci publishes built documentation to the graspologic-docs repo)\r\n- other third party documentation publication services (GraSPy originally used netlify and we still technically have it building documentation for us - perhaps we use it in lieu of rtd?  Can we own our documentation build via github action and just have netlify publish it for us?  Can netlify let us \"publish\" these by version?)\r\n\r\n@loftusa has been sad about our documentation and he may have some ideas as well, so I'm hoping he'll chime in here.\r\n\r\n@bdpedigo, @j1c, @asaadeldin11 - anything else you'd like to add?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/720/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
