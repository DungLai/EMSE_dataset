This is a `pd.Series`, so the mapping is `plot_df.index` -> elements of the series `plot_df[hue_key]`. However, I passed in data where the index of the node data were names of neurons as opposed to an integer index that goes 0...n-1. This is implicitly what is being assumed here since at this point in the code, nodes in `edgelist` are indexed numerically.\r\n\r\n## What to do\r\nI think this can basically be resolved by doing `plot_df = plot_df.reset_index()`, which assumes that `plot_df` and `adjacency` are positionally indexed, but we assume that already. also should add a test for this use case. \r\n\r\ncc @dlee0156 ","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
