It is conceptually impossible to do a causal analysis on whether the identified feature is causally involved in the capacity we are discussing. Consider doing a 'knock-in' and 'knock-out' experiment, or another form of a positive and negative control.  It is conceptually not even possible.  We cannot change just one graph statistic, without altering essentially all of the others.  This is why we need parametric models, where parameters can be manipulated independently of one another (such as the mean and variance).","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
