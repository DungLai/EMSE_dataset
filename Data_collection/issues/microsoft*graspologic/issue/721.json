We're not doing that right now.  What's should we do?  Are there any tools that can help us?  We have a bespoke CICD process - what will we need to change to incorporate new tooling?\r\n\r\n## More Details\r\n\r\nTaking the PR titles doesn't seem to be a useful thing.  I don't really want to rely on those as our change notes.  Some other teams I know have used tooling like https://github.com/microsoft/beachball but I'm not sure if that would be appropriate for us or not?\r\n\r\nWe need someone who can do some digging and checking things out for how this would work, which means they should get a good handle on exactly how our CICD-style publication process works in Graspologic first.  We will likely have to change a lot of stuff, no matter what we choose, so we need someone to really own this process.  I built it, so I can explain it all, but I'm afraid I'm not going to have the time to give this the attention it needs, so I'm looking for someone I can hand this off to and own the CICD process for us.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
