were using readthedocs for our documentation hosting, but have since moved to hosting it ourselves on our `gh-pages` branch so we don't run up against the documentation generation timeout

\r\n\r\nSo we should put a semi-temporary sphinx generated stub site in our docs folder and update the `.readthedocs.yml` file to direct RTD to build this new site and redirect any users that have the
