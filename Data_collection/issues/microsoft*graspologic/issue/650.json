Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhile I was browsing through the docs I found out that there isn't any instructions regarding how to install the graspologic library in conda environment. As sometimes installing via pip in conda environment causes an environment error( as it is in the case of streamlit) so a separate set of instructions for installing graspologic through conda is highly appreciated.\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n\r\nAs earlier we were able to install graspy in conda through the conda-forge option. So I was wondering if we could add instructions to install graspologic in conda wither via conda forge or by creating a virtual environment it will be better for users.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nInstructions to install Graspologic either by virtual env or by conda forge \r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\n\r\nHere is the instrcutions on how to install graspy via conda forge.<br>\r\nhttps://anaconda.org/conda-forge/graspy\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
