Please describe.\r\n\r\nIt seems odd to me that the parameters returned by some of the fit models are not necessarily the parameters that the model would typically be specified with. For instance, consider an SBM:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom graspologic.simulations import sbm\r\nfrom graspologic.models import SBMEstimator\r\n\r\nn = [20, 20]\r\nB = [[.8, .2],\r\n     [.2, .8]]\r\n\r\nA = sbm(n=n, p=B)\r\n\r\ny = [0 for i in range(0,n[0])] + [1 for i in range(0, n[1])]\r\n\r\nmodel = SBMEstimator(directed=True, loops=False)\r\nmodel.fit(A, y=y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only parameter produced by the model appears to be a `n x n` probability matrix, `model.p_mat_`, and I cannot seem to get back an estimate of the original `p` I had specified without coding that myself manually.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nProduce the parameters which the simulations accept asa leading arguments, in addition to the probability matrix.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional context","closed_by":{"login":"ebridge2","id":8883547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODM1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8883547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2","html_url":"https://github.com/ebridge2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
