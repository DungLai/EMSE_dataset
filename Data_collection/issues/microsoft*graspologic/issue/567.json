Please describe.\r\nThe following is an issue to wrap up a bunch of specific items that will be tracked independently later, but we agreed in principle that the embed module should, in general, have two main means of usage:\r\n\r\n- A consistent sklearn fit, transform, fit_transform adherence in the embedding classes, with appropriate warnings if it does not make sense.  \r\n  - In the case of something like node2vec, there are no separate fit and transform steps, so calling these functions will either need to do `fit_transform` together and return results along with using the `warning` system, or raise an error.\r\n- A consistent functional approach (call a function with some parameters and the graph and receive an embedding matrix in return)\r\n\r\n@bdpedigo can we enumerate the specifics for every module in `embed` either in a response to this ticket or as separate tickets (I'll turn the former into the latter if we don't do it to start with)?  I just want to make sure we track everything through to completion","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/567/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
