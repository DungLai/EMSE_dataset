If this input is provided then sample_edges should use the numpy.random.Generator object to sample from bernoulli. \r\n\r\n## References\r\n[numpy.random.Generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html?highlight=random%20sampling%20numpy%20random#module-numpy.random) is the newly adopted pseudo-random number generator utilized and maintained by numpy.
