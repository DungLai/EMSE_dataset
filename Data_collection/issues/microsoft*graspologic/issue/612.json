Only a few of the parameters for either down projection are available, and none of them are available on the node2vec portion. We should consider exposing these, either by exhaustively listing all of the parameters available on node2vec, umap, and tsne, or by accepting a dictionary of named parameters for each call so someone who wants to try other configurations can try them by passing in the appropriate dict that we kwarg out to the functions.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
