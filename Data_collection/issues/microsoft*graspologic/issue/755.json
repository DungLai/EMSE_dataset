Please describe.\r\nWould be good to standardize conventions for certain parameters/descriptions during our effort to improve the API.\r\n\r\nFor example, for all the graspy embeddings, we called the dimensionality of the embedding `n_components` to match sklearn\r\nNode2vec calls this `dimensions`\r\n\r\nFor most of the parallelization that used joblib, we called the number of workers `n_jobs` to match joblib\r\nBut in some places, in graspy/graspologic/topologic, it's `workers`\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI think consistency with parameter names as well as explaining some of the common terms we might take for granted would be good. \r\n\r\nI really really like how sklearn has [this glossary](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html) to both explain terms but also define standards, I think we could do something similar.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nThis will probably be ongoing work, but we could start a document where we at least define/discuss the standard terms\r\nand variable names we want to shoot for. \r\n\r\nWill also make it easier for new people to contribute I'd think.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
