I would like to apply this network machine learning to the current research to measure the country dependence on import of agricultural commodities (i.e. wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) in the context of food insecurity. I have no background of network machine learning but I have monthly data for country to country import share. Is there anyone who is interested in working together to analyze what happens if Russia bans wheat exports to Egypt that is a big importer of wheat from Russia? Or Is there anyone who can guide me 1) to learn this methodology and 2) to apply to the current problem which I want to solve? Any tips would be very appreciated.\r\n \r\n ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
