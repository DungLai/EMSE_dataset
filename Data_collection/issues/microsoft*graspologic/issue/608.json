Please describe.\r\nWorking on something now where I often want the unscaled version of the ASE/LSE embedding, that is, just the left or right singular vectors without scaling each by sqrt(singular value).\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWould like a `scaled=False` keyword argument, default kept as it is.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nObviously easy to unscale after getting the current embedding, just less convenient. Does make the embeddings even closer to just SVD, but ASE at least has `diag_aug`, and LSE has some preprocessing to form the Laplacian.\r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\nAt least one of the very early embedding papers had unscaled as an option: https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2228\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nWould also make code in MASE simpler I think? https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/graspologic/embed/mase.py#L158 could just use the new ASE, passing down `scaled`","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
