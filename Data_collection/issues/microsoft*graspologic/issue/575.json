Please describe.\r\nAbstract from the paper below: \r\n```\r\nGiven a network and a subset of interesting vertices whose identities are only\r\npartially known, the vertex nomination problem seeks to rank the remaining vertices\r\nin such a way that the interesting vertices are ranked at the top of the list. An\r\nimportant variant of this problem is vertex nomination in the multi-graphs setting.\r\nGiven two graphs G1, G2 with common vertices and a vertex of interest x ∈ G1, we\r\nwish to rank the vertices of G2 such that the vertices most similar to x are ranked at\r\nthe top of the list. The current paper addresses this problem and proposes a method\r\nthat first applies adjacency spectral graph embedding to embed the graphs into a\r\ncommon Euclidean space, and then solves a penalized linear assignment problem\r\nto obtain the nomination lists. Since the spectral embedding of the graphs are only\r\nunique up to orthogonal transformations, we present two approaches to eliminate this\r\npotential non-identifiability. One approach is based on orthogonal Procrustes and is\r\napplicable when there are enough vertices with known correspondence between the\r\ntwo graphs. Another approach uses adaptive point set registration and is applicable\r\nwhen there are few or no vertices with known correspondence. We show that our\r\nnomination scheme leads to accurate nomination under a generative model for pairs\r\nof random graphs that are approximately low-rank and possibly with pairwise edge\r\ncorrelations. We illustrate our algorithm’s performance through simulation studies\r\non synthetic data as well as analysis of a high-school friendship network and analysis\r\nof transition rates between web pages on the Bing search engine.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nCould implement as part of new vertex nomination module\r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14622.pdf\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nTotally unclear whether we want this. need to talk to @jovo and Carey and co.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
