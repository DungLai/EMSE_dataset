One thing we aim to do with this project is bridge the gap between the math and the software developers tasked with implementing these techniques on large organizational datasets (as an example).  The point is that the commentary, parameter style, etc, all need to reflect a target audience that is often ignored when writing such scientific libraries.\r\n\r\nWe don't need an ELI5 series of comments or documentation efforts, but at least \"Explain like I haven't thought about lingear algebra in a decade\" is a fair target.  One way of achieving this isn't necessarily going into great detail on the _how_, but instead on the reasoning for _why_, as well as any interesting behaviors about how the range of values provided to a parameter may impact the resulting computation.","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/503/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
