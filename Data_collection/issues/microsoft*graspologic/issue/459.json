A copy of the MIT license text in a file called \"LICENSE.TXT.\" Include your project name above the copyright statement.\r\n\r\nREADME. A \"README.md\" file that must include a link to the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct, a trademark notice, and security reporting instructions. Consider including additional details about the project in the README.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTING. A CONTRIBUTING.md file that contains instructions how to contribute to the project. Here is the minimum information required. All contributions must be done subject to Microsoft's Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\"). Releases on GitHub have CLA's enabled by default. If your project is not on GitHub, ensure that contributors first sign our CLA.\r\n\r\n// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation and contributors.\r\n// Licensed under the MIT license.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we need to make sure we're doing all of that.  We also may have a contributors.md file at some point including all of the contributors, though I'm going to try to automate the creation of that somehow first.. and again, I'll do that in a separate ticket.","closed_by":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
