Please describe.\r\nGraph matching can be slow \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWould like the option to use sparse matrices or numba to speed up the gradient and step size calculations in Franke-Wolfe algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nScipy:\r\n- most of our matrices are sparse, even though the gradients are dense, this may still speed up the calculations described above. \r\n- I dont know if this actually helps much because there's always a dense matrix in the products, so does using a csr_matrix help? \r\n\r\nNumba: \r\n- does not work with scipy sparse as far as I'm aware, currently, though I saw some discussion of it. \r\n- Should be a quick way to make the code faster with almost zero changes\r\n- Change would not be compatible with putting into scipy. but maybe we cross that bridge when we come to it (cython?)\r\n\r\nIn either case, it also seems like we should create functions like `_compute_gradient` and `_compute_step_size` to make the code more readable. Esp. if going the numba route.
