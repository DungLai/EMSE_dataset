(if they try to provide \"euclidean\" - raise an exception)\r\n- wrapping the currently used dissimilarity metrics into similarity measures (very obvious how to do it for the gaussian kernel. less so obvious for l1/l2, but obviously possible (for example by subtracting all from the max or doing 1/. )\r\n- some sort of a combination of the two right above: for example, expecting a callable metric, but using a gaussian kernel if unspecified.
