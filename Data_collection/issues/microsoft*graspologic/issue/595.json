Please describe.\r\nMany algorithms in this package enable joint analysis of multiple graphs. There is no real-world dataset of connectomes from multiple subjects included in this package. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAdd a small and well-studied dataset to the `dataset` module. NeuroData members have extensively analyzed this dataset previously. \r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nWe can use functions to simulate random graphs, but working with real data can give much more context to what the graph statistical algorithms are doing. \r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117274","closed_by":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
