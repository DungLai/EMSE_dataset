No need to feel shy - we're happy to talk about graphs!\r\n\r\nI have been trying to run LatentDistributionTest using several graphs.  On some pairs of graphs I get the following error:  \"n_components must be <= min(X.shape)\".  This comes from svd.py line 241.  Originally I left n_components as None to let Graspologic choose the correct value.  Then I tried setting n_components to 256.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that some of the graphs that fail have a low edge count.\r\n\r\nI am sending in NetworkX graph objects and letting graspologic handle the embedding.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the issue above, the LatentDistributionTest code runs for six hours or so but does not seem to take much memory or CPU time.\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on the expectations for n_components?  Should I do something different?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/580/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
