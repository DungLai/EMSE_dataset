We often load logs that tell you the current \"weight\" as the relationship is made, which means last should absolutely win.\r\n     - If not, should the weights be summed on each new entry? We often load logs that have no weight at all, and the number of entries is our proxy for a weight.\r\n- Load a bipartite graph (presume two entries with identity defined in column `a` as having a relationship together if they share another a value from a column `b`)\r\n\r\nWe also want to re-identify graphs from their string representations of nodes to an unsigned int and a dictionary of string -> int mapping.  This can help us drastically consolidate the memory footprint of our graph when loading them into a networkx graph, though this would make sense to be a separate enhancement/feature request as well.  In some ways it would be nice to have this at load time as well as just be able to convert an existing networkx graph, which is why I bring it up now.","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
