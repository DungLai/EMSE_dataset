Seems to always favor extremely high number of clusters. I have played around with different settings for about 2 hours and cannot find one where GMM does appreciably better than K-means, and the number of clusters predicted is even close to the true number of clusters (seems to usually be 8 or 9)\r\n\r\n## Example Code\r\n\r\n3 near-perfectly gaussians separated with extraordinarily high probability (density of overlap between the different gaussians is ~0), and I cannot seem to get AutoGMM to give me a good clustering where KMeans does appreciably worse, and AutoGMM gives me something within the ballpark of the true number of clusters.
