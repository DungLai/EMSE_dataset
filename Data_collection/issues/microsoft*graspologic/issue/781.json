Please describe.\r\n\r\nPandas is one of the most important Python packages among data scientist’s to play around with the data. Pandas library is used mostly for data explorations and visualizations as it comes with tons of inbuilt functions. Pandas fail to handle large size datasets as it does not scale or distributes its process across all the cores of the CPU.\r\nModin accelerates Pandas queries by distributed computing. It utilizes all the cores of the system\r\nTo speed up the computations, one can utilize all the cores of the CPU and speed up the workflow. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n Implementation and usage of the PyPolars library or Modin library and comparing its performance with Pandas library.\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n PyPolars has an API very similar to that of Pandas, but still, it does not cover all the functions of Pandas. For example, we don’t have .describe() function in PyPolars, instead, we can use df_pypolars.to_pandas().describe()\r\nModin does not support all the Pandas functions, but it supports the most famous ones.\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/krsatyam1996/2a8e7cb74305c9005f0091d88e6a04e3#file-pypolar-ipynb\r\n## Additional context\r\nfor PyPolars\r\nFor demonstrations, Here, a large size dataset is used (~6.4Gb) having 25 million instances.\r\n![1_DJ28uvzxWUcF7FViFS0wJA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53184883/116960184-487ed480-acbd-11eb-9c17-ffbc86bcb233.png)\r\n\r\nFor modin:\r\n![1_V82tUDMjuHCXO8U56iT8wg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53184883/116997504-80583d00-acfa-11eb-8c3f-1465928314a6.png)\r\n\r\n![1_mrskOKj7p5MXVMBGalGMCA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53184883/116997510-82ba9700-acfa-11eb-83ae-1a6e72952871.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/781/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
