Not the biggest fan of plotly. Thoughts appreciated. \r\n\r\nSo for actual plots:\r\n1. Function for plotting 1 or more adjacency/similarity/dissimilarity matrices as heatmaps\r\n2. Pairwise scatter plots. So given X \\in R^{n x d}, it plots each pairs of dimensions as scatter plots\r\n3. A generic scatter plot. Given X \\in R^n and Y \\in R^n, just makes a scatter plot.\r\n4. ??\r\n\r\n@jovo @ebridge2 @bdpedigo ","closed_by":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/45/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
