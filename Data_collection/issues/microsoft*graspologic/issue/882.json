now, MASE says that $A^{(i)} = VR^{(i})V^\\T$, which means that the estimated latent position for each graph is $X^{(i)} = V S^{(i)}$ with $S^{(i)} = |R^{(i)}|^{1/2} = QD^{1/2}$, with Q and D obtained from the SVD of $R^{(i)}$. \r\n\r\nCurrently, MASE doesn't return individual latent positions $X^{(i)}$ for each network with the `fit_transform` method, it returns $V$. Since it also has a `scores_` attribute, you can technically calculate each $X^{(i)}$, but I think it's a big ask to assume that the user of the library knows how to do that. \r\n\r\nI propose adding a `graph_latents_` attribute (or something similarly named), which is calculated lazily (e.g., calculations happen only when you need, via an `@property` decorator), and which retrieves the individual latent positions for each graph $X^{(i)} = V S^{(i)}$.\r\n\r\nThat way, it's also bit less overhead to compare directly with OMNI, since OMNI returns its version of the $X^{(i)}$ with its `fit_transform` by default.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"loftusa","id":12386450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12386450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa","html_url":"https://github.com/loftusa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
