I had no interest trying to get Python's \"pass any type of node id you want of any type\" thing working in Rust so I just forced everything to encode as a string, which is great when the calling graph's nodes are strings too, but apparently has some issues in auto.py where it's using the original node ID (as an `int`, in this case) as the lookup to generate our `size` dictionary, but using str(node_id) as the key it's looking up with - which isn't going to appear in the sizes dict.\r\n\r\nWe just need to be careful that any dicts we create in this process are based on a `str(node_id)` or else we'll get things like this.\r\n\r\nThere's a similar typing issue in `leiden` and `modularity` where we implicitly cast your provided graph as `str(node_id)` for you to be nice and helpful when you call leiden, return `str(node_id) -> partition_id` mappings from leiden, and then when you try to call modularity on it to see how it turned out, it explodes because the graph you provide has `int(node_id)` keys and you're trying to look up `str(node_id)` mappings.\r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that maybe the right fix is for the python wrapper to our rust native impl should capture the node type in Python, let it cast to string for Rust and Leiden to process it, then before we hand the partition dictionary back we re-cast back to the original type.  And if we purposefully kept the original -> new mapping in memory in Python, we don't even have to have a lossy \"cast back\", since we'd just replace the new string representation of it back with the original as it was.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the short explanation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/804292409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/804307788","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/738#issuecomment-804307788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/738","id":804307788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDMwNzc4OA==","user":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-22T18:47:56Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T18:47:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> All of this is to say that maybe the right fix is for the python wrapper to our rust native impl should capture the node type in Python, let it cast to string for Rust and Leiden to process it, then before we hand the partition dictionary back we re-cast back to the original type.

[ ] Does this PR add any new dependencies?\r\n- [x] Does this PR modify any existing APIs?\r\n   - [ ] Is the change to the API backwards compatible?\r\n- [x] Have you built the documentation (reference and/or tutorial) and verified the generated documentation is appropriate?\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\n\r\nPartially fixes #738\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Briefly explain your changes.\r\nWhen running Leiden, if your graph has `int` (or anything other than `str`) node IDs, we automatically convert them to string representations for the native leiden impl to handle.  The problem is that the node id -> partition dictionary we return uses the `str` representation as the key, which won't map up to the value you actually provided in your networkx Graph.\r\n\r\nThis definitively fixes the bug in Leiden - which was one of the issues we had in #738!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that 738 also has a bug almost the same in n2v - namely, that the nodes are converted to strings for word2vec to operate over them, then returned as string labels.  We fixed the first problem, but not the second - yet.  @nyecarr is working on a n2v refactor that will fix this, and thus fully close #738.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, this should solve Leiden over our graphs.  ~~I just realized I also need to create a test to validate it works over matrices as well as networkx - so I'll make sure that works in a test prior to actually completing this PR.~~ This is done now\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me that we need a new minor release with a breaking API change if we haven't actually published a final release of 0.2.0 yet.  Our dev / prerelease versions will certainly have a breaking api change, but ... I don't think this needs to become 0.3.0?

Briefly explain your changes.\r\nOriginal implementation of node2vec only truly worked if a graph's node ids were strings. Because gensim's word2vec expects strings to generate the random walks, we were getting incorrect results when passing in a graph with node ids of any type other than string. This PR will fix this issue by immediately creating a new graph that has the same exact edgelist except all node ids are remapped to a unique string. Then, before returning the embedding, we remap the results from word2vec back to the original node ids.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nN2v is used in when generating layouts so I added an additional test around layout_umap to verify both string and int node ids return as expected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4621757996,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDYyMTc1Nzk5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4621757996","actor":{"login":"Nyecarr","id":4693255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTMyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4693255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr","html_url":"https://github.com/Nyecarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nyecarr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-20T21:51:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
