So far, the process is that the forloop function returns a score_new and a perm_inds_new(the permutation order) for each run and I save them in result matrix. After running self.n_init times, the result matrix will have self.n_init rows. Then select the smallest score from the result matrix and its corresponding perm_inds_new and replace the previous one. Can you tell me whether it make sense or not? If not, what is the problem of it?\r\nAnd with 500 vertices, n_init=80, the runtime is 566.39 vs 345.27, which means it is faster with parellel function. And if we fix the n_jobs=5, the run time is 328.86, which is shorter than n_jobs=self.n_init. I think we also need to consider the trade-off.\r\n\r\nHere is the updated notebook: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SHAAAAN/MyGraspy/blob/master/codes/withPar.ipynb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/595600225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SHAAAAN","id":45969738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTY5NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45969738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN","html_url":"https://github.com/SHAAAAN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SHAAAAN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/595654057","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/300#issuecomment-595654057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/300","id":595654057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTY1NDA1Nw==","user":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T08:15:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T08:15:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"NVM you are right, the name init_num made me think n_init\n\nWhat about the other thing I suggested?\n\nOn Fri, Mar 6, 2020, 4:57 AM ShanQiu <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Each run of \"forloop\" should only compute one run of FAQ.
