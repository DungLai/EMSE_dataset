I know it is static and beartype is dynamic, right? but in practice what is this doing for us? \r\n   - If nothing, can we remove? \r\n- What is our policy on mypy compatibility for legacy code that is private? \r\n- any tips on getting mypy to tell me what the function is that is actually causing the error? --verbose did not do it for me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-31T17:13:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T17:13:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/911","id":1119665119,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCM7Erc4x2ZTs","number":911,"title":"Fixed
