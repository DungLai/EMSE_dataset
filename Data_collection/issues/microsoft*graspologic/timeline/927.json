However, I think there are a lot of tricks to get \"surrogates\", at least for what I imagine to be the \"most common\" case that will arise (e.g., assume weighted, undirected, adjacency matrix). I think you can reasonably still use the fact that a weighted, undirected, adjacency matrix with diagonal aug or a laplacian X are PSD, and therefore you can compute the *proportion* of the singular values in-place by just using the sum of the top k singular values (where k=ZG2) divided by the trace of X (e.g., the \"proportion\" of the singular values). If this value is big, it's pretty clear your elbow was probably at least not *losing* much information in the embedded matrix. I don't work with directed matrices so it's unclear to me how common this situation is, however.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/1064686993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ebridge2","id":8883547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODM1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8883547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2","html_url":"https://github.com/ebridge2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
