this sort of thing is done by issue tracking software. You track every new feature, every bugfix and every enhancement, assign them to a release and then generate release notes from the descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are using maven, there is a the maven changes plugin(http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/index.html) for this purpose and producing this report could thus be easily automated in an continuous integration process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you use JIRA (which I'd suggest any way), it can auto-generate the release notes(https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/creating-release-notes-861253367.html) for you. The built-in format is rather simplistic, but works well in many cases. The content is customizable to a point, albeit this is not the ultimate word in terms of flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you look for better release notes from JIRA, try the PDF View Plugin(https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/5167/better-pdf-exporter-for-jira). It:\r\n\r\n\r\n- more than just a raw \"completed issues\" list (ex: installation and upgrade instructions, legal details, executed tests, changed files)\r\n\r\n- more control over what is included (excluding certain statuses, resolutions, issue types, etc.)\r\n\r\n- allows distributing your Release Notes document in email (PDF format) or printed on paper\r\n\r\nhere is a sample from JIRA Pdf Plugin:\r\n\r\n![O6spt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53184883/109616954-d0305180-7b5b-11eb-8653-fb816d5d934a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/788703006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rajpratyush","id":53184883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTg0ODgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53184883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush","html_url":"https://github.com/rajpratyush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/788705971","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/721#issuecomment-788705971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/721","id":788705971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4ODcwNTk3MQ==","user":{"login":"rajpratyush","id":53184883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTg0ODgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53184883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush","html_url":"https://github.com/rajpratyush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajpratyush/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-02T08:06:42Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T08:06:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dwaynepryce
