implementation is our `I-DAD `implementation. Note they do `DH*(D-A)*DH` which is just `DH* D *DH-DH* A *DH`, where `Dh=D^(-1/2)`. Then it is clear the implementations are the same as their `DH` should be equivalent to our `D_root`; note we have `I-D_root* A *D_root` where `D_root=D^(-1/2)`. The main difference i see is that they store things internally as adjacency lists; we are typically using adjacency matrices, so therefore the natural implementation would use a sparse matrix (what they use) instead of a dense like we currently are. Also, note they take the laplacian and then normalize with D^(-1/2), which i believe is symmetric normalized laplacian.
