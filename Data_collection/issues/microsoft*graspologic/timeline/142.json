would non-parametric bootstrap as you describe. Fit a p for each block on the binarized graph, then sample the weights of nonzero edges as described. This would be semi parametric zero-inflated model.\r\n\r\nThat said, for sampling, i think it would be relatively easy to allow people to specify (a) a model for the structural properties of the edges (ie, ER, SBM, etc) with (b) parameters accordingly (ie, vertex communities), and (c) have another option for the qualitative properties of the edges and (d) kwarg list for the edge weight sampling model (ie, normal, poisson, model free) where the particular (a) and (c) specified indicate which model it is that the graphs are sampled from. Provide a common template for calling the respective models for (a) and (c) such that your code is irrespective of the particular (a) and (c) as long as they work together (whatever that means). \r\n\r\nThat way you have a generalizable approach for people to either extend and provide their own stuff, or develop some substantial models from defaults.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/478066646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ebridge2","id":8883547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODM1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8883547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2","html_url":"https://github.com/ebridge2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T19:19:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T19:19:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/173","id":445118639,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjc5NjM2NTA5","number":173,"title":"Graph

Here, only one is implemented, but we could support more or find which methods are best in the future \r\n- There are several different ways to model the relationship between degree corrections and community membership in the DCSBM. For now, the degree correction parameters are tied to a simple block, but another model would be to randomly sample a community membership and independently sample a degree correction parameter \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2375034449,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIzNzUwMzQ0NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/2375034449","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-29T13:04:32Z","milestone":{"title":"GraSPy 0.0.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2402188507,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQwMjE4ODUwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/2402188507","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-10T20:53:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
