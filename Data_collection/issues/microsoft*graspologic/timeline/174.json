Reference Issues/PRs\r\nCloses #142 \r\nCloses #143\r\nCloses #174 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nAdds classes for fitting unweighted graph models to data, including ER, DCER, SBM, DCSBM, and RDPG\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- Does not support weights\r\n- There are many ways to estimate communities in the a posteriori SBM and DCSBM. Here, only one is implemented, but we could support more or find which methods are best in the future \r\n- There are several different ways to model the relationship between degree corrections and community membership in the DCSBM. For now, the degree correction parameters are tied to a simple block, but another model would be to randomly sample a community membership and independently sample a degree correction parameter \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2402188532,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQwMjE4ODUzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/2402188532","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-10T20:53:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
