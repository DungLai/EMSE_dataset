Glad you liked it. I can try something with a lowercase g and also the uppercase G without the edges outside the G. Yes, I do have some experience but it is mostly a hobby, i know a few things about vector graphics and typography but i am mainly a developer. \r\n\r\nI love the idea of making this in matplotlib. Someone could give it a go 😅. It will eventually need to be converted to a vector graphic and you will need to test several sizes, test to see if it looks good in black-and-white, it will have to be tested for colour blindness. That's a few things that are standard for logos.
