Reference Issues/PRs\r\n- Fixes #367 (except modified Procrustes).\r\n- Fixes #429 \r\n- Also see #380 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n- Introduces align module, which has the following three classes:\r\n  - SignFlips\r\n    - Previously a function in the LatentDistributionTest.\r\n  - OrthogonalProcrustes\r\n    - Effectively a wrapper of the scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes().\r\n  - SeedlessProcrustes\r\n    - Also colloquially known as JAgt; aligns the two dataset via an iterative algorithm that alternates optimal transport and regular procrustes.\r\n    - Massively sped up from the previous implementation, predominantly by omitting the outer-most loop, and also by using the POT package.\r\n- All classes have a consistent .fit_transform() type of API, where they take two datasets in fit() and one dataset in transform.\r\n- Substitutes scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes() and LatentDistributionTest.medial_sign_flips() with objects of the module everywhere where applicable.\r\n- Added an option to use SeedlessProcrustes as alignment techniques in LatentDistributionTest (but not default yet); added necessary arguments and documentation.\r\n- Includes tests for all of the modules, as well as tests for the new / changed functionality of the tests.\r\n- Some comments / docs changed / added in LPT / LDT.\r\n- fit_plug_in_variance_estimator migrated from LatentDistributionTest to utils. Unchanged otherwise (future work will be #378).\r\n- fixed the docs of the inference module while i was at it.\r\n- Slightly refactored LDT code (see #380). .metric is now always what user is provided. The associated callable is .metric_func(). Furthermore, .test is now what user has provided as test. hyppo object get instantiated in .fit, which should be much safer for resuing. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- No tutorial notebooks made. See #414 .\r\n- Does NOT implement scaling-rotation or diagonal-rotation type of procrustes as a part of the module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pauladkisson","id":34703136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzAzMTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34703136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson","html_url":"https://github.com/pauladkisson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauladkisson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-11T01:00:21Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T01:00:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/525","id":718732586,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTAxMDU5OTA3","number":525,"title":"Standardize
