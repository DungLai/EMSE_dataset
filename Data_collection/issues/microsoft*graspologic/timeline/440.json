[here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1390681.1442798):\r\n\r\n- Add mixed membership stochastic block model(MMsbm) sampling function to simulations.py:\r\n    - Must accept as input the number of vertices of the network, the block connectivity matrix B and the parameter alpha for \r\n       sampling of mixed membership vectors from Dirichlet distribution.\r\n    - Must output resulting adjacency matrix\r\n- Written documentation, listing all inputs and outputs\r\n- Written tutorial that shows simple functionality and difference with SBM\r\n\r\n**Any other comments?**\r\n\r\n- The tutorial for the new MMsbm function currently stands on its own outside of the sbm tutorial notebook in the docs folder. If requested, it could easily be appended as a new section of the sbm notebook tutorial.\r\n- A notebook with **the Simulation of Figure 6** from [MMSBM paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1390681.1442798) by Airoldi et al.(2008) for **validation purposes** can be accessed by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PerifanosPrometheus/GiorgioDiSalvo/blob/master/Simulation/Figure6.ipynb) and is located [here](https://github.com/PerifanosPrometheus/GiorgioDiSalvo/blob/master/Simulation/Figure6.ipynb). \r\n- All tests in test_sims.py are pretty self explanatory besides for test_labels. In this test, I set a concentration parameter in such a way that all nodes should always belong to the second community of a 2-community MMSBM. Then I check that the labels provided actually match the expected output.\r\n\r\n- graspologic/simulations/simulations.py now contains the new function called MMsbm.\r\ntests/test_sims.py now contains the tests for the new function.\r\ndocs/tutorials/simulations/MMsbm.ipynb contains tutorial for new function","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4170852692,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE3MDg1MjY5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4170852692","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-05T16:54:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
