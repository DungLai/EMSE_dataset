Since we are going to support `mug2vec`, and @QuasiLegendre @tathey1 and others are interested in chaining graspy functions, I think we should decide how to support pipeline-type things. According to sklearn glossary, [transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-transformers) must be [transductive](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-transductive). Since we have not implemented true transform methods for many of our embeddings (I don't think they are truly transductive), we aren't supported by `sklearn.pipeline`.  But, after reading the docs, the only reason I see for changing our stuff to have some kind of transform method would be to take advantage of the model selection utilities in sklearn such as `GridSearchCV`. @tathey1 is that something you are interested in doing? \r\n\r\nAnother idea is to write our own `graspy.pipeline` function/class that works with our own stuff, I think it would basically just iterate through a list of functions/classes and handle the kwargs,

yea I've looked at the issue, and it actually does make sense to implement a true `transform` function for `MASE`. That is, once it learned the common latent position matrix, it can be used to `transform` any other graph(s) with matched vertices. Similar to, say, PCA where you can learn the components from one dataset, and apply the components to different data assuming the features are the same. This is trivial to implement and we should do this.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see is with `ASE`, `LSE` and `Omni` where doing this out of sample embeddings is hard and not intuitive. Perhaps one solution is to absorb `OutOfSampleASE` to be the transform function for ASE and LSE. I see #237 with a hacky solution to this for `MASE`, but I don't feel comfortable calling that `transform` function since `transform` necessarily means that it can take in data that was not used to fit the model. \r\n\r\nIm also fine with writing our own pipeline.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/513978522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/515575342","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/69#issuecomment-515575342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/69","id":515575342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTU3NTM0Mg==","user":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T19:39:37Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T19:39:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> For an estimator to be usable together with pipeline.Pipeline in any but the last step, it needs to provide a fit or fit_transform function. To be able to evaluate the pipeline on any data but the training set, it also needs to provide a transform function. There are no special requirements for the last step in a pipeline, except that it has a fit function. All fit and fit_transform functions must take arguments X, y, even if y is not used. Similarly, for score to be usable, the last step of the pipeline needs to have a score function that accepts an optional y.\r\n\r\nFrom: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#pipeline-compatibility\r\n\r\nI propose that we do not have a `transform` function for `ASE`, `LSE` and `Omni`.
