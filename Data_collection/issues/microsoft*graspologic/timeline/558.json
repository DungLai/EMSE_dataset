good @aaitbr - \r\n\r\nas far as this issue goes, the goal is just to reduce the amount of input checking code we have across the library by refactoring that code to a utils or assertions module. \r\n\r\nI'm linking a few places you can see tons of input checking code:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/e465fa39ceb65156e3dea1d256fb566eb14aa215/graspologic/embed/base.py#L221\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/e465fa39ceb65156e3dea1d256fb566eb14aa215/graspologic/inference/latent_distribution_test.py#L218\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/e465fa39ceb65156e3dea1d256fb566eb14aa215/graspologic/simulations/simulations.py#L51\r\n\r\nIf you take this on, I'd recommend starting by focusing on `ValueError` checking - if you look above in this issue, we have discussed trying to set up `TypeError` checking once we get `typing` set up as well (see #504, which we could also use help on) using something like . Therefore, hopefully the type errors wont need checking at all if we can find a way to handle them with some sort of library that lets us just use decorators. \r\n\r\nI also link to a few input checking functions in sklearn that we can use for this project. \r\n\r\nAs far as making PRs go, I'd recommend making small PRs (i.e. even if they only address one or two modules), because they will get reviewed faster and you'll get feedback faster. \r\n\r\nlet me know if anything is unclear! like I said, #504 would also be another place we could use help - im not sure whether people have made much progress on it but I havent seen any PRs merged there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/800264430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4464591274,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2NDU5MTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4464591274","actor":{"login":"aaitbr","id":80335647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzM1NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80335647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr","html_url":"https://github.com/aaitbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-16T13:36:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4464591281,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NjQ1OTEyODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4464591281","actor":{"login":"aaitbr","id":80335647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzM1NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80335647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr","html_url":"https://github.com/aaitbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaitbr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-16T13:36:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/938353443","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/558#issuecomment-938353443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/558","id":938353443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM7Erc437iMj","user":{"login":"bradycargle","id":79949869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTQ5ODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79949869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle","html_url":"https://github.com/bradycargle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradycargle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T05:22:13Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T05:22:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looks
