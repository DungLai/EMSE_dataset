Reference Issues/PRs\r\n- Fixes #222 \r\n- Fixes #358  \r\n- Fixes #363 \r\n- Fixes #370  (the 0 permutations part; for change in api see #375)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nFor #222:\r\n- introduced the sampling from the asymptotic distribution of the ase correction\r\n- added corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\nFor #358:\r\n- No longer raises an exception with directed inputs\r\n- Added corresponding tests\r\n\r\nFor #363:\r\n- added the capability to use sklearn kernels (for hsic test, which is same as mmd) \r\n- raising warnings when distance used with hsic or kernel used with hsic\r\n- added corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\nFor #370:\r\n- No longer raises an exception with 0 bootstraps\r\n- fit_predict left unchanged (returns a nan if used with 0 bootstraps)\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n- removed gaussian medial kernel implementation and instead importing it from hyppo\r\n  - avoid code duplication \r\n  - that version is parallelizable\r\n- the default changed from \"dcorr\" + \"euclidean\" to \"hsic\" + \"gaussian\". reasoning behind the change:\r\n  1. in theory, dcorr and hsic are almost the same, except that one uses distances and the other uses kernels (they are in fact, equivalent for some choices of distances and kernels, as per distances and kernels EE paper). in practice \"dcorr\" + \"euclidean\" and \"hsic\"+\"gaussian\" either perform very similarly, or \"hsic\" has an advantage (see: https://mgc.neurodata.io/tutorials/independence/indep_power.html ) .\r\n  2. Minh's nonpar paper, which proves the convergence uses Gretton's MMD (which is same as \"use k-sample transform + hsic\"), rather than Energy (which  is same as \"use k-sample transform + dcorr\"). i wouldn't be surprised if it is possible to prove a similar thing for Energy as well, but no one has yet.\r\n  3. the test that we used to have before adding hyppo backend (MMD) is the same as \"hsic\" + \"gaussian\". obviously because of implementation differences, results of old sims won't be reproduced exactly, even when seeded, but this is the closest possible choice to be \"backward-compatible\"\r\n  4. all my simulations for the size correction paper were performed with MMD. in theory, they should transfer to, say, dcorr and maybe other tests, but i am most confident in this specific choice.\r\n- added an option to use workers=-1 to specify all possible threads (consistent with hyppo and sklearn)\r\n- passing workers to sklearn's distances and kernels\r\n\r\n####

practitioners (read: Vince, cep) only care about the test statistic and not the p-value. obviously one can still extract it if they perform the full test. however, that wastes time and resources. one can set the number of iterations to 1 to minimize that, but we can still do less. i propose to allow the number of permutations to be set to 0 (hyppo allows that, so really it is just a change in argument check). i am happy to do this, but:\r\n\r\nthis brings up the following questions: what should be happening to the fit_predict in that case? should it return the test statistic instead? or the p-value of 1? or NaN? should we be raising warnings?\r\n\r\nand on a larger scale: should we really have this API? should fit predict return p-value, or a tuple of a p-value and a test statistic, like many other tests in python? furthremore, should it really be a class? once again, most tests in python that i have seen (scipy, statsmodels) are functions, not classes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"alyakin314","id":25692376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjkyMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25692376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314","html_url":"https://github.com/alyakin314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T08:31:46Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T08:31:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/177","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/177/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/177/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/177/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/177","id":446704597,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDY3MDQ1OTc=","number":177,"title":"UnmatchedTest

We can set whatever API makes the most sense on our own, and then pass it off to whatever repo (possibly with a few cosmetic changes, but likely not much)\r\n- I agree that these algos should be able to eat embeddings. Another option would be to allow a user to pass in an `embed_kws` dict but I hesitate to do that till we have a good use case for that. \r\n- Possible APIs: \r\n    1. classes, like they are now\r\n    2. functions that return some kind of result object\r\n    3. functions that return pval, tstat, and dictionary of anything else. \r\nMy current preference, though I could be convinced otherwise, is to go with 3. I think this matches API of other tests better, I haven't been able to think of a use case where one needs to take the test object, modify it, and call another method. And there's not that much data to keep track of. It would also alleviate issues we talked about in #380 which would take more restructuring to fit if we keep as a class. \r\n\r\nLmk your thoughts, I see this as one of the main tasks we can get done

lol\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/671975248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T22:56:21Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T22:56:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/380","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/380/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/380/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/380/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/380","id":672933779,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDYyODg0MjYw","number":380,"title":"save

For LDT i have no issue with embeddings being passed.\r\n\r\ncould you elaborate on repeated embedding calls? i found a total of 1:\r\nhttps://github.com/neurodata/graspy/blob/0f4441ddc8dc09840147fed0f33f7c6be2dedb30/graspy/inference/latent_position_test.py#L206\r\n\r\n> > * notes on possible API's:\r\n> >   \r\n> >   * im strongly leaning towards it being a function, but not settled on the return type.\r\n> >   * if by return object you mean a custom thing with methods (so that we would end up with the same thing we usually call `ldt`, but instead of a user explicitly instantiating it, it would be done internally), i strongly oppose it. whereas, if by return object you mean a dict-like thing, then the named tuples that you hate so much actually cover your bullet points 2 and 3, because you can both assign them as `p_value, stat, _ = `, or extract as `object['p_value']`.\r\n> \r\n> I am ok with dict like thing, or tuple, including named tuples. What I meant was that some stuff in scipy returns a `result` object like this https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult.html not for stats specifically as far as I know. But this kind of thing is what I meant by returning a custom object, which I'm not a fan of.\r\n\r\nyeah, not a fan of this either. feels like a clunky intermediate between a dict and an sklearn object.\r\n\r\n> > * i am not yet fully sold on the fact that we should always return all three.\r\n> \r\n> thoughts on this scheme https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.multiscale_graphcorr.html\r\n\r\nwill address this in a little bit.\r\n\r\n> > * also, something i want to mention is - i highly discourage anyone to use the statistic obtained from nonpar for anything, other than comparing it with statistics generated from the permutation of the same sample. so obtaining the p-value or plotting the null and the sample stat is okay, but using it for clustering, graph matching, etc. is most likely wrong. that's especially important if the backend test is done via exact equivalence, but really, it is almost always true that comparing the stats between two pairs of graphs is apples to oranges.\r\n> \r\n> fair enough, maybe worth talking about in the docs
