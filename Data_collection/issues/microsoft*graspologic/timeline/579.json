be accomplished by recreating the graspologic tutorial using the sk-network SVD mainly because we trust ASE tutorial. \r\n\r\nFor runtime, use adj matrix you decide to use for efficacy, just choose a set of vertex sizes and plot node vs time with a line for each us and them\r\n\r\nFor comparing LSE and Spectral efficacy:\r\nI will follow the same procedure for doing the graspologic tutorial adopted for LSE, which does not involve much change in the original change. \r\nI will then recreate the sk-network Spectral in the same format of the graspologic  doing the same error analysis as

found that [scipy's implementation of the lanczos algorithm](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html) is extremely fast for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a big, sparse real symmetric square matrix (I'm pretty sure more so than sklearn's `randomized_svd` or scipy's `sparse.linalg.svds`, although this all needs to be tested empirically).\r\n\r\nin the case of undirected graphs, our adjacency matrices are going to be square and symmetric, so the singular values will be the eigenvalues (right?), and most of them are going to be pretty sparse\r\n\r\nSo a potential NDD project could be testing the various algorithms for finding eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and more generally doing SVDs for speed, on different types of matrices, and then using the ones that are fastest in e.g. [SelectSVD](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/graspologic/embed/svd.py#L173), and then adding some blurb in the docs about when it is appropriate to use which

In theory, the dimension needs to be <= the number of nodes. In practice, depending on the algorithm for doing the SVD that you use, it may need to be <= number of nodes - 1. In general, it will likely be << the number of nodes, otherwise using ASE in general is probably a bad idea. \r\n\r\nSo, yes, next steps sound good.
