If so, that would be cool, but I also don't see any issue with just having 2-3 really quick install instructions on the readme that are hard-coded and will likely almost never change (pip install/conda install) and then more extensive instructions (and tips for people who are new to python, for example) on the actual docs. I get that we don't want to redouble effort but I feel like this could be more trouble than its worth in this case.
