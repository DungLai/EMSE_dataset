Explain your changes.\r\n\r\n- The attribute representing p-value is now always called .p_value_. \r\n- .fit() now returns self. added fit_predict() method that fits the model and returns p-value (what .fit() used to be doing previously). Modified the tests and tutorial where necessary accordingly.\r\n- removed .bootstrap() as an abstract method from the base class, since the nonparametric test does not use it. \r\n- transferred the embedding parameter from the base class to the latent position test, since it makes very little sense to choose between ase and omni for the nonparametric test.\r\n(happy to revert the latter two changes if anyone vetos them)\r\n- upd: latent position test now de facto includes the original sample itself when computing the p-value. this leads to a valid test does not have issues with 0 p-values, nor with p-values > 1. continuity correction removed.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nnote that this does not address #222 , nor makes any amends to tutorials other than the ones necessary for them to work with fit no longer returning p-value.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3470165153,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ3MDE2NTE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3470165153","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-22T21:05:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
