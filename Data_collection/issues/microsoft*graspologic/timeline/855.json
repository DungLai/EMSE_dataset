perambulating in an exhausted late-night stupor through this exciting project, I couldn't help but notice this issue. As Mr. Beartype, I am the culprit responsible for everyone's pain here. :disappointed: \r\n\r\nThe core issue is that PEP 585 deprecates *most* of PEP 484. Specifically, *most* of the `typing` module (including `typing.List`) will be going away by 2024. You have two options here:\r\n\r\n* **Easy way.** The easy way is, as @bdpedigo suggests, to just unilaterally squelch this warning with an ignore warning filter on `BeartypeDecorHintPepDeprecatedWarning`. Since this is currently the only type of deprecated type hint, this is a decent *temporary* solution. Of course, this solution will still fail sometime in 2024 with fiery explosions. Thanks alot, Guido! If that wasn't easy enough, here are two even easier ways to do this with differing tradeoffs depending on who you want to suffer the most – you or your awesome userbase:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Do it globally for everyone, whether they want you to or not!\r\n# This is the \"Make Users Suffer\" option.\r\nfrom beartype.roar import BeartypeDecorHintPepDeprecatedWarning\r\nfrom warnings import filterwarnings\r\nfilterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=BeartypeDecorHintPepDeprecatedWarning)\r\n...\r\n\r\n# Do it locally only for you! (Hope you like globally increasing your\r\n# indentation level in every single package module.)\r\n# This is the \"Make Yourself Suffer\" option.\r\nfrom beartype.roar import BeartypeDecorHintPepDeprecatedWarning\r\nfrom warnings import catch_warnings, filterwarnings\r\nwith catch_warnings():\r\n    filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=BeartypeDecorHintPepDeprecatedWarning)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Hard way.** The hard way is to use type aliases to conditionally annotate callables with either PEP 484 *or* 585 type hints depending on the major version of the current Python interpreter. Since this is life, the hard way is also the best way – but it's also hard. For example, you might define a new private `graspologic._typing` submodule resembling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sys import version_info\r\n\r\nif version_info >= (3, 9):\r\n    List = list\r\n    Tuple = tuple\r\n    ...\r\nelse:\r\n    from typing import List, Tuple, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen instead of importing `List` and `Tuple` from `typing` when annotating callables, you import `List` and `Tuple` from your private `graspologic._typing` submodule instead: e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Instead of this...\r\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\r\n\r\n# ...just do this.\r\nfrom graspologic._typing import List, Tuple\r\n```\r\n\r\n What could be simpler? <sup>*gagging sounds faintly heard*</sup>\r\n\r\nAnd... I should just write this up as a FAQ entry already. May your pain be felt by no one else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/930912873/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leycec","id":217028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzAyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/217028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec","html_url":"https://github.com/leycec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5385537558,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCM7Erc48APCvzwAAAAFBAMgW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/5385537558","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-30T07:20:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5385537561,"node_id":"SE_lADOCM7Erc48APCvzwAAAAFBAMgZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/5385537561","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-30T07:20:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"leycec","id":217028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzAyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/217028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec","html_url":"https://github.com/leycec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leycec/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T07:32:14Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T07:32:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beartype/beartype/issues/52","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beartype/beartype","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beartype/beartype/issues/52/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beartype/beartype/issues/52/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beartype/beartype/issues/52/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beartype/beartype/issues/52","id":1010404997,"node_id":"I_kwDODw8UQc48OY
