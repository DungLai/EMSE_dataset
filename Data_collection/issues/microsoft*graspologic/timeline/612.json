is a new feature to provide some processes for automatic layout generation and rendering.\r\n\r\n`graspologic/layouts/auto.py` is the main automatic do-a-layout file.  There are currently two dimensionality reduction processes we use; t-SNE and UMAP.  The process for each is:\r\n\r\n- take a networkx graph\r\n- shrink it if necessary by cutting the smallest edges\r\n- use only the largest connected component\r\n- create a node2vec embedding from it\r\n- use tsne or umap to get an x and y coordinate from it\r\n- automatically size each node based on their degree\r\n- run a no-overlap process that @bryantower created which shuffles things around to make sure we don't have thousands of nodes on the same point\r\n- create a color palette based on the leiden communities and a [thematic](https://microsoft.github.io/thematic) color palette and use it for the nodes in those communities\r\n- ultimately using networkx' draw graph capabilities, save the graph \r\n\r\nWe also added a runnable module so that you can call it via `python -m graspologic.layouts {args}` to run it from CLI instead of within the interpreter.  It's fairly on rails on purpose, because we wanted people to use the library not the CLI.

issue is to organize some thoughts on changes I'd like to see for our layout code. Happy to have feedback.\r\n\r\n## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n- [x] Layouts should run on directed networks (see #655). If the user wants to color by automatically detected community, then I'd suggest that we just symmetrize the graph internally (only for the community detection step) and proceed. I don't think this is overstepping our bounds as to what the user wanted, personally, because this is typically the notion of community for directed graphs. \r\n- [ ] Automatic layouts should also be possible using ASE/LSE. I have had a lot of success generating layouts that I like using ASE as opposed to n2v so I think \"algorithm\" could just be a parameter.\r\n- [ ] Allow passing dictionaries of arguments to stage 1 (n2v/ASE/LSE) and stage 2 (umap/tsne) (see #612)\r\n- [x] Should have an interface to the layouts code that feels like what we have in `.plot` and seaborn. I think we could refactor the code such that we can still have all-in-one functions that eat graphs and spit out plots like `layouts.save_graph`, but there's no reason we can't also let people interact with some of these functions in a way that's more like matplotlib/seaborn.\r\n- [x] NoOverlap should be an option the user can turn on or off.\r\n   - Addressed in #758   \r\n- [ ] Layouts should run on adjacency matrices also\r\n\r\n## Provide references (if applicable)\r\nI have some code [here](https://github.com/bdpedigo/giskard/blob/main/giskard/plot/graph_layout.py) which is closer to the flavor of what I'd want to see for graph plotting code that works with seaborn/matplotlib. Just a reference, not necessarily how we should do anything here. One thing I never figured out for that code which would be nice is automatic scaling of edge/node widths/sizes etc. based on the size of the graph, so that an initial shot at an embedding at least looks reasonable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
