regard to this issue, I think there is some pretty inefficient stuff in the match tests at the moment. Right now, the whole qap library is being stored in `qapdata` (~20 .dat files) , but I've recently changed the tests to only use one of these matrix pairs. I propose deleting this `qapdata` folder which is storing a lot unused things, and just making the single example I am using in my test file, since it's only a 12x12 matrix anyway. This will solve the path issue, and also get rid of unused data.
