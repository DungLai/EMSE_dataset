Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #287 \r\nFixes #59 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n - Updates diag aug to use in and out degree \r\n - Adds diagonal augmentation as a default for ASE with the option to turn it off\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n - Seems like we should definitely do augment diagonal for ASE, but what about omni? \r\n - Should I add a short tutorial about diag-aug (I already wrote the simulation, would just have to write up some text to go with it) \r\n - Is it worth saving the modified matrix that is actually embedded? Sometimes I like to make screeplots and the like, or just heatmap the matrix itself. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2808172211,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgwODE3MjIxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/2808172211","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-18T16:21:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3769252564,"node_id":"MDE1OlVuYXNzaWduZWRFdmVudDM3NjkyNTI1NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3769252564","actor":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-15T16:23:43Z","assignee":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
