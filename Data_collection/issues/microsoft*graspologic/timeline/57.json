Anibal,\r\n\r\nIt seems that not all `249 x 249` matrices are symmetric. If the matrices are not symmetric, they are considered directed graphs and will give you the left and right latent positions. This is expected behavior. Looking a little bit further into the matrices, the maximum element-wise difference of any `249 x 249` matrix and its transpose is in the order of 10^-15, suggesting either a data type casting issue (typically going from 32bit to 64bit data) or floating point arithmetic issue.\r\n\r\nA solution is to symmeterize each matrix, cast the data to `np.float32`, or just use either `embeddings[0]` or `embeddings[1]`.
