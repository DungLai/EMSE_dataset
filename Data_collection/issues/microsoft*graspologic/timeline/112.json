Or, use `graspologic.utils.is_fully_connected` from our own codebase. However in #112 we are talking about replacing the networkx-based check with a faster one from scipy. Not sure if the layouts code will always assume networkx input going forward. AFAIK there is nothing that inherently needs to be undirected for the layouts process, or am I missing something?
