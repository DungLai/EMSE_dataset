[x] Does this PR have a descriptive title that could go in our release notes?\r\n- [x] Does this PR add any new dependencies?\r\n- [x] Does this PR modify any existing APIs?\r\n   - [x] Is the change to the API backwards compatible?\r\n- [x] Have you built the documentation (reference and/or tutorial) and verified the generated documentation is appropriate?\r\n\r\nFixes #901\r\n\r\nThis PR kind of needs a bit of a history lesson.  Back in the day, when we first added this, all node ids had to be strings.\r\n\r\nThey had to be strings because it seemed easier to turn an int into a string than a string into an int (this is not necessarily true, but that *was* the thinking at the time).  And because we had to turn it into a string *somewhere*, we did it in Python, because nobody wants to try to make Rust carefully coerce Anything At All into Strings.  No one. \r\n\r\nSo Rust expected a String id, and our python wrapper just said \"hey, you guys know how to make other things into strings, you do it\".  And then users said \"but we don't want to, and why are integers so scary to you anyway\", and we said \"ok, that is fair I guess\" and so we tried to get clever by converting all of the Object types provided to us in the various graph representation forms into Strings.  And it worked!  \r\n\r\nWe had a few bugs along the way like #756, but eventually we got it so that when you provided us a networkx Graph of integer node ids, you'd get it back, or an AdjacencyMatrix, or whatever; you expected integers that correspond to the node ids, not str(int), and so we complied.\r\n\r\nBut we ignored and forgot about doing the same action for the starting_communities, because ... we just missed it.  And by we, I distinctly mean **I**.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went for a while until one of our users was using timeseries graphs and using the previous month's communities to jump start the next month's community detection with leiden.  And they had int ids.  And they took their returned map of int node_ids -> communities and tried to hand it right back to us.\r\n\r\nNow, the problem there is that we took their node ids, converted them into strings, gave them to rust, converted them back to the original objects, and used those objects in the dictionary we were returning the user - because the user isn't going to want str(int) as the key in their dictionary when their node ids are ints, remember?\r\n\r\nBut now we have a problem, because the starting_communities very explicitly want node_ids that are strings, and we didn't map them, because, again, you can do that, right?  And we forgot that we said we were going to do that.  And again, by we, I mean very distinctly **I**.  \r\n\r\nSo this PR fixes that.
