Reference Issues/PRs\r\nFixes #618 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Briefly explain your changes.\r\n- Fixes bug from `check_estimator` inputs changing\r\n- Fixes bug from a `mug2vec` test failing - I am not sure what changed in `GaussianMixture` to cause this. Changing the random seed also appeared to fix this bug on my machine, but I figured that making the problem slightly easier would be more robust.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\nWe probably don't even need these `check_estimator` tests, at some point we wanted to verify sklearn-ness explicitly, not sure that we care now.
