do you have any opinion on the api? should these be functions or classes? i feel that for all of these the reusability potential is similar to the inference - the only reason to fit the object again is to avoid re-instantiating parameters.\r\n\r\ni see a couple ways we can pursue this:\r\n1. classes that have a fit_transform(X, Y) which return X', Y' (in all of our applications so far, one of these is equivalent to starting ones). then we also have attributes/methods that return the (usually orthogonal) matrix Q s.t. X' = XQ, if there is such.\r\n2.  classes that have a fit_predict(X, Y), which returns Q. the user then has to do X'=QX. this would be problematic if we ever had an align thing that transforms something nonlinearly.\r\n3. functions which return X', Y' (and potentially something else)\r\n4. functions which return Q (and potentially something else\r\n\r\n- my implementation of the seedless procrustes is currently 2 (see: https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/blob/nonpar-fix/graspy/align/seedless_procrustes.py ). \r\n- scipy's procrustes is 3 with some additional disparity thing returned (see: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.procrustes.html ). \r\n- sign flips function in nonpar code is 3\r\n-  lastly, agterberg's implementation in R is 4. as it returns Q, R and the value of the objective (see: https://github.com/jagterberg/nonparGraphTesting/blob/master/R/optimal_transport.R)\r\n\r\nthey don't have to be all the same in theory, but since some of them can be used in the same context - it'd be nice if they are. i'd say seedless procrustes makes the most sense to be a class, because it has so many other things attached to it, in addition to X' and Y' ( Q, R, value of the objective), and it probably has more reasons to be such than inference, but i am not convinced yet that it needs to be.\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nupd: i messed up and looked at the [wrong procrustes](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.procrustes.html) . [this one](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.orthogonal_procrustes.html) just returns R and

@bdpedigo do you have any opinion on the api? should these be functions or classes? i feel that for all of these the reusability potential is similar to the inference - the only reason to fit the object again is to avoid re-instantiating parameters.\r\n> \r\n> i see a couple ways we can pursue this:\r\n> \r\n> 1. classes that have a fit_transform(X, Y) which return X', Y' (in all of our applications so far, one of these is equivalent to starting ones). then we also have attributes/methods that return the (usually orthogonal) matrix Q s.t. X' = XQ, if there is such.\r\n> 2. classes that have a fit_predict(X, Y), which returns Q. the user then has to do X'=QX. this would be problematic if we ever had an align thing that transforms something nonlinearly.\r\n> 3. functions which return X', Y' (and potentially something else)\r\n> 4. functions which return Q (and potentially something else\r\n> \r\n> * my implementation of the seedless procrustes is currently 2 (see: https://github.com/neurodata/graspy/blob/nonpar-fix/graspy/align/seedless_procrustes.py ).\r\n> * scipy's procrustes is 3 with some additional disparity thing returned (see: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.procrustes.html ).\r\n> * sign flips function in nonpar code is 3\r\n> * lastly, agterberg's implementation in R is 4. as it returns Q, R and the value of the objective (see: https://github.com/jagterberg/nonparGraphTesting/blob/master/R/optimal_transport.R)\r\n> \r\n> they don't have to be all the same in theory, but since some of them can be used in the same context - it'd be nice if they are. i'd say seedless procrustes makes the most sense to be a class, because it has so many other things attached to it, in addition to X' and Y' ( Q, R, value of the objective), and it probably has more reasons to be such than inference, but i am not convinced yet that it needs to be.\r\n> \r\n> thoughts?\r\n\r\nHere I am torn. I think 3. would be a common use case, but I definitely want to be able to get out Q. This is probably what makes sense 90% of the time for most uses revolving around graspy. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the reason I thought it would make sense to have this align module in the first place is sorta because I kept wanting to use these tools like an object - for instance, I was learning a transformation from a subset of matched vertices, and then I was using that transformation on the rest of the data. So it felt like the `.fit` `.transform` framework would have made a lot of sense there

Any disagreements or are we on the same page?\r\n\r\nokay, so I agree in general agree with this approach. let's settle on this.\r\n\r\nhere is one question: currently all of our existig transformers are fit to two sets of data, but only actually transform one of them (in your example Y). it is possible to imagine some that would transform both. a simple example would be a sign flip, if it is done in carey's form, where everything is brought to first orthant. furthermore, the methods used in semipar in theory can match Y to X, but it probably makes more sense, if, say the diagonal-rotation, instead projects both embeddings onto a sphere.\r\n\r\ni've been thinking about what's the most sensible API to handle this, and most options seem weird. i don't want the API between the transformers that mess with one to be incompatible with ones that mess with both.\r\n\r\nhere is the best i came up with so far: make X the one which is always transformed, and have Y optional. so if only one is transformed, this is legal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprocrustes.fit(X', Y')\r\nX_transformed = procrustes.transform(X, Y=None) \r\n```\r\nbut so is:\r\n```\r\nprocrustes.fit(X', Y')\r\nX_transformed, Y_transformed = procrustes.transform(X, Y=Y) \r\n```\r\neven though `Y_transformed == Y` is true.\r\n\r\nbut when both are transformed, one either has to do this:\r\n```\r\nprocrustes.fit(X', Y')\r\nX_transformed, Y_transformed = procrustes.transform(X, Y) \r\n```\r\nor we allow to only pass X, but throw a warning? or no warning? or, I can even make X and Y both optional (but obviously break if neither is provided). \r\n\r\nfit_transform always returns both of 'em to be universally consistent.\r\n\r\nanyway, the reason why i think X is the one always transformed is so that it can be passed positionally.

Reference Issues/PRs\r\n- Fixes #367 (except modified Procrustes).\r\n- Fixes #429 \r\n- Also see #380 \r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\n- Introduces align module, which has the following three classes:\r\n  - SignFlips\r\n    - Previously a function in the LatentDistributionTest.\r\n  - OrthogonalProcrustes\r\n    - Effectively a wrapper of the scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes().\r\n  - SeedlessProcrustes\r\n    - Also colloquially known as JAgt; aligns the two dataset via an iterative algorithm that alternates optimal transport and regular procrustes.\r\n    - Massively sped up from the previous implementation, predominantly by omitting the outer-most loop, and also by using the POT package.\r\n- All classes have a consistent .fit_transform() type of API, where they take two datasets in fit() and one dataset in transform.\r\n- Substitutes scipy.linal.orthogonal_procrustes() and LatentDistributionTest.medial_sign_flips() with objects of the module everywhere where applicable.\r\n- Added an option to use SeedlessProcrustes as alignment techniques in LatentDistributionTest (but not default yet); added necessary arguments and documentation.\r\n- Includes tests for all of the modules, as well as tests for the new / changed functionality of the tests.\r\n- Some comments / docs changed / added in LPT / LDT.\r\n- fit_plug_in_variance_estimator migrated from LatentDistributionTest to utils. Unchanged otherwise (future work will be #378).\r\n- fixed the docs of the inference module while i was at it.\r\n- Slightly refactored LDT code (see #380). .metric is now always what user is provided. The associated callable is .metric_func(). Furthermore, .test is now what user has provided as test. hyppo object get instantiated in .fit, which should be much safer for resuing. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- No tutorial notebooks made. See #414 .\r\n- Does NOT implement scaling-rotation or diagonal-rotation type of procrustes as a part of the module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3842567501,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg0MjU2NzUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3842567501","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-05T21:49:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
