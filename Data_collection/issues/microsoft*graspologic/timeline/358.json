Reference Issues/PRs\r\n- Fixes #222 \r\n- Fixes #358  \r\n- Fixes #363 \r\n- Fixes #370  (the 0 permutations part; for change in api see #375)\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\r\nFor #222:\r\n- introduced the sampling from the asymptotic distribution of the ase correction\r\n- added corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\nFor #358:\r\n- No longer raises an exception with directed inputs\r\n- Added corresponding tests\r\n\r\nFor #363:\r\n- added the capability to use sklearn kernels (for hsic test, which is same as mmd) \r\n- raising warnings when distance used with hsic or kernel used with hsic\r\n- added corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\nFor #370:\r\n- No longer raises an exception with 0 bootstraps\r\n- fit_predict left unchanged (returns a nan if used with 0 bootstraps)\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n- removed gaussian medial kernel implementation and instead importing it from hyppo\r\n  - avoid code duplication \r\n  - that version is parallelizable\r\n- the default changed from \"dcorr\" + \"euclidean\" to \"hsic\" + \"gaussian\". reasoning behind the change:\r\n  1. in theory, dcorr and hsic are almost the same, except that one uses distances and the other uses kernels (they are in fact, equivalent for some choices of distances and kernels, as per distances and kernels EE paper). in practice \"dcorr\" + \"euclidean\" and \"hsic\"+\"gaussian\" either perform very similarly, or \"hsic\" has an advantage (see: https://mgc.neurodata.io/tutorials/independence/indep_power.html ) .\r\n  2. Minh's nonpar paper, which proves the convergence uses Gretton's MMD (which is same as \"use k-sample transform + hsic\"), rather than Energy (which  is same as \"use k-sample transform + dcorr\"). i wouldn't be surprised if it is possible to prove a similar thing for Energy as well, but no one has yet.\r\n  3. the test that we used to have before adding hyppo backend (MMD) is the same as \"hsic\" + \"gaussian\". obviously because of implementation differences, results of old sims won't be reproduced exactly, even when seeded, but this is the closest possible choice to be \"backward-compatible\"\r\n  4. all my simulations for the size correction paper were performed with MMD. in theory, they should transfer to, say, dcorr and maybe other tests, but i am most confident in this specific choice.\r\n- added an option to use workers=-1 to specify all possible threads (consistent with hyppo and sklearn)\r\n- passing workers to sklearn's distances and kernels\r\n\r\n####
