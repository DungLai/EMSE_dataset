Also @j1c I have been able to run all the tests with python 3.8.5 on my machine for the graspy simulations tests (as seen in my prelim PR docs in dfrancisco1998-tests directory). So I think that part is good. I have been getting two errors though, which seem to indicate an issue with file not found in the /tests/match/ tests as well as an error  zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity for the test_plot.py testing gridplot. I even get an error when I run through the tutorial for plotting with python 3.8.5. I have been trying to fix these two issues this past weekend, but I am running out of ideas.
