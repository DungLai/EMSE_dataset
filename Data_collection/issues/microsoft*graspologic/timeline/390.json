Thoughts on api? There are few wrinkles in this.\r\n\r\n1. There is no out of sample prediction. You train and predict on the input dataset, so standard `fit` and `fit_predict` doesn't make sense. It could be a class with just `fit_predict`, but then it could just be a function.\r\n2. There is graph-wise and vertex-wise anomaly detection. But the embedding process is the same for both, so you can do both graph-wise and vertex-wise anomaly detection with one set of embeddings.  \r\n\r\nSo things to decide is:\r\n- Should graph-wise and vertex-wise be in same class/function or separate. I think it make sense to include both in same class/function since embedding is the more computationally intensive part\r\n- Should it be a function or class. With function, it requires 5+ things to be returned, but it also doesn't conform to classic sklearn style class. We could do something like mgc does and return `(graph_anomaly_indices, graph_anomaly_dict, vertex_anomaly_indices, vertex_anomaly_dict)` or something along those lines. No opinions on this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/684992395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3715897610,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcxNTg5NzYxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3715897610","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T16:47:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3715897615,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MTU4OTc2MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3715897615","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T16:47:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/686576960","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/390#issuecomment-686576960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/390","id":686576960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjU3Njk2MA==","user":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T15:37:55Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T15:37:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"- From your description, I agree that graph-wise and vertex-wise make sense in the same class/function\r\n- class/function is a bit harder. ya, it sounds like neither are super convenient. I guess this is why scipy has stuff like [OptimizeResult](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult.html) which is basically just a dict. Though I actually don't know if there are any advantages to using that over just a dict, normally I'd say no to a class just to store data right?

Refactored code for importing multiple graphs from `BaseEmbedMulti` to `utils.py`. \r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- I was thinking for these functions/classes that combine bunch of stuff together, we could do something like `**embed_kwargs` instead of copying and carrying over all the embed parameters.  So things like `n_components`, `n_elbows`, `algorithm`, etc. Thoughts?\r\n- This could be in an anomaly module, but I put it in `pipeline` instead.\r\n- No tutorials here. Perhaps NDD task to recreate some figures in the paper. Happy to help.\r\n- No parallelization here. I could implement parallelization for the embedding part.

paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10055)\r\n[book section](http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/applications/ch10/anomaly-detection.html)\r\n\r\none issue I ran into while implementing this / playing around with it in python is that it's super not robust to embedding dimension. As in, I looked at the distribution of true test statistics under the null and bootstrapped test statistics under the null, and if the embedding dimension is different, they look completely different from each other and the test is broken. \r\n\r\nSee below. The experiment is:\r\n\r\n1. Starting without adding any anomaly graphs or anything fancy, generate a single latent position matrix X =  X_1, …, X_n \\in R ~ Uniform[.2, .8]\r\n2. Generate A_1, A_2 ~ RDPG(X)\r\n3. Generate Xhat from OMNI(A_1, A_2), then taking the first n rows\r\n\r\n4. Iterate 1000 times:\r\n  - Generate _A, _B ~ rdpg(X)\r\n  - Embed with OMNI(_A, _B) to get latent position estimates _X, _Y\r\n  - let y = ||_X - _Y||, l2 operator norm (largest singular value of difference)\r\n  - plot distribution of y as histogram\r\n\r\n4. Iterate 1000 times:\r\n  - Generate A_, B_ ~ rdpg(Xhat)\r\n  - Embed with OMNI(A_, B_) to get latent position estimates X_, Y_\r\n  - let y_ = ||X_ - Y_||\r\n  - plot distribution of y_ as histogram\r\n\r\nThe first image is what happens when you (incorrectly) embed down to two dimensions, and the second image is what happens when you (correctly) embed into one dimension.\r\n\r\n<img

issue is somewhat alleviated in practice if you embed every adjacency matrix you have at once and then just take pairs (maybe since the variance is lower?) but you'll still get a pretty big bias.\r\n\r\nWas thinking of hopping on zoom with Guodong at some point to talk about
