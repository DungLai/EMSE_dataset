In theory most of our stuff should work, but `llvmlite` that `numba` uses doesn't have a 3.9 wheel.  Then it jumped to trying to use sdist (which is fine!), but wouldn't build, because building native libraries for Python in windows is always just a bit more special than doing it on a unix variant (admittedly, I may be more negative on this than others because I know exactly what to do in Ubuntu and am reasonably confident in OSX, but in Windows I just have a sort of golden-retriever-doing-science look on my face when anything comes up).\r\n\r\nSo... that's a long winded way of saying \"I should just create the FAQ
