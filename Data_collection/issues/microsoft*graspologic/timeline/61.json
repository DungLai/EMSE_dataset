If values span only the positive or only the negative, I agree that there should only be 1-tone.\r\n\r\nIm not sure if you are denoting **small numbers** to be negative numbers, or small as in the magnitude. If you are suggesting that the color scale should diverge in the same color spectrum (e.g. white when near 0 and red when going in either positive or negative direction), I don't agree with this. If you are suggesting that a sequential colorbar should be used (e.g. white for the most negative number, and increasing as values increase), I don't agree with this either.\r\n\r\nI believe the _intensity_ of color should be based on the absolute magnitude of the value, and color to mean which direction the magnitude is (one color for positive and another for negative). Otherwise, you dont get a one-to-one correspondence from a number to a color.  -5 should show as being different color than +5 because they _are_ different.\r\n\r\nSee some examples below. I sample a weighted sbm where on the first diagonal block is sampled from N(-2, .5) and second diagonal block is sampled from N(2, .5). Off diagonals are just binary.\r\n\r\nChoosing the most negative to be white doesn't make sense. Presence of color should mean magnitudes > 0.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5142539/48531691-46192d80-e86b-11e8-81df-79e74cad54a9.png)\r\n\r\nChoosing the 0 to be white and diverge in same color. Looks fine, but how do i know which value the color correspond to? there is no one-to-one correspondence from value to color\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5142539/48531745-76f96280-e86b-11e8-8e07-c0a7b7187952.png)\r\n\r\nThis one makes most sense to me.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5142539/48531844-ee2ef680-e86b-11e8-97ae-683f5e970720.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/438922330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/438925106","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/61#issuecomment-438925106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/61","id":438925106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODkyNTEwNg==","user":{"login":"ebridge2","id":8883547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODM1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8883547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2","html_url":"https://github.com/ebridge2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebridge2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T05:44:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T05:44:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sure;
