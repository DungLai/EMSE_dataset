On some pairs of graphs I get the following error: \"n_components must be <= min(X.shape)\". This comes from svd.py line 241. Originally I left n_components as None to let Graspologic choose the correct value.

Should I do something different?\r\n\r\nhey @jonmclean! the number of components is the number of dimensions that you want to embed into. typically this is a small number compared to the graph size. sometimes one can have a  priori knowledge of the number of components. for example, if you have a hypothesis that your graph comes from a stochasitc blockmodel with three blocks, it makes sense to embed it into three dimensions. in general,  however, when there is no such knowledge, we suggest using Zhu and Ghodsie automatic selection procedure, which you can do by setting n_components to None. it does not make sense for the number of your components to be larger than the size of your graph. a slightly handwaivy comparison with regular data science would be to try to take a PCA into 100 components of a data that has 10.\r\n\r\nwe would need more information regarding the LDT taking so much time. in particular, could you provide the size of your data, the exact LDT function call, and ideally your specs.\r\n\r\ncheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/724312302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alyakin314","id":25692376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjkyMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25692376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314","html_url":"https://github.com/alyakin314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyakin314/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3976051167,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk3NjA1MTE2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3976051167","actor":{"login":"jonmclean","id":4429525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T22:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3976051173,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NzYwNTExNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3976051173","actor":{"login":"jonmclean","id":4429525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T22:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/724323264","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/580#issuecomment-724323264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/580","id":724323264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDMyMzI2NA==","user":{"login":"jonmclean","id":4429525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmclean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-09T22:44:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T22:45:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When
