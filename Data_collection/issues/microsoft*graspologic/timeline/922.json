[x] Does this PR have a descriptive title that could go in our release notes?\r\n- [ ] Does this PR add any new dependencies?\r\n- [x] Does this PR modify any existing APIs?\r\n   - [x] Is the change to the API backwards compatible?\r\n- [ ] Have you built the documentation (reference and/or tutorial) and verified the generated documentation is appropriate?\r\n\r\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\r\nCloses #922 \r\nCloses #869\r\nCloses #998 (I think) @loftusa you are welcome to test\r\n\r\n#### What does this implement/fix? Briefly explain your changes.\r\n- Adds Python 3.10 support since we're really behind on that\r\n- Removes Python 3.7 support since that is considered end of life and modern numpy is no longer supporting it. Would like to be able to use new features of scipy, for instance, in https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/992 \r\n- Bumped the major version because of the above\r\n- I couldn't stand super long tests any longer so I stripped down many of the super slow simulation tests\r\n   - By way of explanation, I dont think the tests should be designed to make sure everything is statistically valid etc. so I removed many that were running long simulations to ensure this.\r\n\r\n#### Any other comments?\r\n- Will try 3.11 in a PR after this if this one works\r\n- 3.8 is still used for most things like building docs, should we bump that as well?
