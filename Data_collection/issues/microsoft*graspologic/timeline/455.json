I dont think it autoformats anything. Black, on the other hand, is an autoformatter and automatically format files to conform to PEP8. See [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html).

The nbsphinx extension for sphinx will run and store outputs for notebooks. I see that the topologic just points to the folder in github with notebooks but doesn't appear to rerun them every build. I think it would be better to serve it on the documentation site like graspy did rather than having to deal with github rendering notebooks. Like @bdpedigo said, its a hit or miss when using github. Do you have an idea on where/how to host the documentation website?\r\n \r\nAnother potential step: we use codecov, which I personally think is very useful when writing code to see which parts are covered by my tests. I advocate for this addition in the pipeline (some sort of coverage testing. doesn't have to be
