will be working on the coherent and incoherent subgraphing algorithms from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1427\r\n\r\nThe subgraphing algorithms seek to find a subset of edges such that the conditional probabilities of these edges existing are distinctly different for different classes, as quantified by Fisher's exact test. Once the subgraph has been found for a training set of graphs with class labels, the subgraph can be used to classify a set of training data into those same classes.\r\n\r\nThe incoherent subgraphing algorithm simply finds m edges that have the lowest Fisher's stats, with no additional constraints.\r\n\r\nThe coherent algorithm applies a similar sorting process. but with the added constraint that the m edges must be incident to at least one vertex from a set of n vertices. \r\n\r\nI will be focused on PRing these two algorithms\r\n\r\nI've sent you a Slack message about the data validation portion, if you're able to check it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/557207483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gkang7","id":55039574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDM5NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55039574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7","html_url":"https://github.com/gkang7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkang7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/557675644","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/120#issuecomment-557675644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/120","id":557675644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzY3NTY0NA==","user":{"login":"CaseyWeiner","id":54880846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODgwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54880846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner","html_url":"https://github.com/CaseyWeiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T20:07:06Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T20:07:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I will be merging the iterative and non-iterative signal sub-graph screening algorithms from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1427\r\n\r\nThese algorithms are two screening methods for estimating the signal sub-graph for a collection of distinguishable graphs, classified according to a covariate of interest.\r\n\r\nThe non-iterative algorithm sets a threshold for the correlation between a graph type and the covariate of interest, and then extracts the nodes that pass that threshold.
