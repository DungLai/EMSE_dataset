@j1c @bdpedigo \r\n#### I will address this for Sprint 1 this semester.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nI will \r\n- Convert these four files, located [here](https://github.com/jesusdaniel/graphclass), from R to a Python file with sklearn api:\r\n  - graphclass.R\r\n  - Logistic_group_lasso_ridge.R\r\n  - FISTA_line_search_ridge.R\r\n  - ADMM_group_lasso.R\r\n- I will then make a PR to merge file(s) into Graspy: the PR will include a proof notebook, a tutorial notebook for using the algorithm, all necessary documentation, and unit tests, as well as the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/583759639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CaseyWeiner","id":54880846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODgwODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54880846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner","html_url":"https://github.com/CaseyWeiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaseyWeiner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3020050185,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAyMDA1MDE4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3020050185","actor":{"login":"jovo","id":41842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo","html_url":"https://github.com/jovo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-08T17:44:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3020050186,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMjAwNTAxODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3020050186","actor":{"login":"jovo","id":41842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo","html_url":"https://github.com/jovo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-08T17:44:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3020050187,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAyMDA1MDE4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3020050187","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-08T17:44:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3020050188,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMjAwNTAxODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3020050188","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j
