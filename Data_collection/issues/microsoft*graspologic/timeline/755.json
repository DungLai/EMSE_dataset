* I don't like n_init if only because it sounds like you're saying `initialize n` to me.  **it's a convention in sklearn for sure, but it isn't a convention everywhere and it caught me by surprise the first time I saw it.**  that said, I just started working on the `n_init` leiden feature you wanted to see in gp-native and I ended up calling it `repetitions` so it's not like I have a better example _at all_.\r\n\r\n@dwaynepryce When you say something is not a convention everywhere, does that mean there is a convention and sklearn is deviating from it or there is no convention and sklearn made a choice? If it means there is a convention, then we should follow that. If it means there is no convention, then I think we should follow sklearn for arguments that mean and do the **_exactly_** the same thing (e.g. `n_init` and `n_components`) and not create our own (reminds me of [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/927/))\r\n\r\nFor my preferences:\r\n- n_components\r\n- vertices (I think this is the word in graphbook)\r\n- n_jobs/workers/threads in that order - AFAIK, we use joblib for python-based parallelization so we should use the same name as joblib. the only counterexample i see where we dont use joblib is in n2v, which uses gensim underneath that has `workers`.\r\n- im fine with whatever is clearest to majority of people. If we do embeddings, would need to discuss what to call them for directed graphs. Maybe embeddings_in and embeddings_out?\r\n- `n_init`. At least for me, when a parameter starts with `n_*`, its specifying a number of `*`.  \r\n  - [`n_bootstraps`](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/graspologic/inference/latent_position_test.py#L76) = number of bootstraps\r\n  - [`n_iter`](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/blob/dev/graspologic/layouts/auto.py#L62) = number of iterations\r\n  - so `n_init` should follow as number of
