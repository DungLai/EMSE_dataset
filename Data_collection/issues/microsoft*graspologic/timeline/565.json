Networks represent objects (termed nodes or vertices) and the relationships between them (called edges or sometimes links). `graspologic` contains algorithms for understanding and drawing inferences from network data. \r\n\r\n## Embed\r\nGiven the power of modern machine learning methods for operating on _vector_ data, we often wish to leverage these tools by converting some aspects of our networks to vectors. The `embed` module contains a variety of tools for estimating vector/matrix \r\nrepresentations of networks:\r\n- `AdjacencySpectralEmbed`, `LaplacianSpectralEmbed`, and `node2vec` all represent each node in a single network as a vector (or, for the spectral methods, as a pair of vectors for a directed network).\r\n- `OmnibusEmbed` takes in a collection of _node-matched_ networks, and finds a vector _for each node in each graph_. Node-matched means that the first node in network 1 represents the same object as the first node in network 2, and so on.\r\n- `MultipleASE` takes in a collection of node-matched networks, and learns a joint vector for each node across all of the networks, as well as a unique representation for each input network.\r\n- `mug2vec` (short for multigraph-to-vector) takes in a collection of node-matched networks, and finds a vector to represent each _network_.\r\n\r\nNote that many of these algorithms also can be thought of as inferring the parameters of statistical network models, which can be useful for statistical inference (described below). \r\n\r\n## Align\r\nThe single-graph methods in the `embed` module are useful for learning a representation of a single network if one is only interested in doing analyses on that network alone. However, if we just embed two networks separately, the vector representations do not live in the same _space_ - the vectors have meaning with regard to other vectors for the same network, but have no meaning with regard to those from another. In order to meaningfully compare the representations from two single-graph embeddings, we need to align the vectors that represent each node. The `align` module contains several methods for doing this: \r\n- `SignFlips` is a very simple heuristic that may be useful if speed is important, or one wishes to find an initialization for another algorithm.\r\n- `OrthogonalProcrustes` is a well-known method for finding an alignment of a collection of vectors _if we know a correspondence between the two collections for each vector_. For networks, this will be the case if we have node-matched networks as described in `embed`.\r\n- `SeedlessProcrustes` is a method for aligning when the correspondence between the collections of vectors is unknown, or even when the number of vectors is not the same.\r\n\r\n## Cluster\r\nClustering is a fundamental unsupervised data analysis problem, in which we seek to find groups of objects which are similar according to some definition. For networks, we often which to cluster the vector representations learned by the `embed` module. The `cluster` module contains several ways of clustering without having to specify the number of clusters or other parameters in advance.\r\n- TODO: description of specific algos\r\n\r\n## Partition\r\nA classic network analysis technique is to uncover _communities_ or _modules_ from a network. An _assortative_ community is one in which nodes within a community are more likely to have edges to other members of that community than they are to other communities. The `partition` module contains algorithms for partitioning a network into these assortative communities and evaluating their _modularity_, a metric of how assortative a network and its partition are.\r\n- TODO: explain the specific tools\r\n\r\n## Simulations\r\nSimulating networks (that is, sampling a new network from some distribution) has a variety of applications: it can be used to test algorithms, to compare observed network properties to some null distribution, or to study the properties of these network distributions, to name a few. The `simulations` module provides functions for sampling new networks from a variety of distributions from the statistics literature. These functions all require the user to know and provide the parameters of the distribution they wish to sample from.\r\n- TODO: explain the simulations we have\r\n\r\n## Models\r\nGiven an observed network, we may wish to estimate the parameters of one of the network distributions described in `simulations`. The tools in the `models` module allow the user to pass in a network, and get back estimated parameters of these distributions. It also contains tools for assessing the fit of these models to the observed data.\r\n- TODO explain the models we have\r\n\r\n## Inference\r\nIf we observe two networks, a natural question is often to ask whether they are \"the same\" in some sense. However, in real data situations, it is unlikely that we will observe two networks which are exactly the same. To make an analogy to classical statistics, we could flip a fair coin 10 times and count the number of heads (experiment 1), then do the same with another coin (experiment 2). We wish to infer whether the two coins have the same probability of coming up heads - but due to the randomness in this experiment, we wouldn't just conclude that the two coins have different probabilities just because the counts are different. This problem is known as the _two-sample testing_ problem. The `inference` module contains algorithms for performing principled two-sample tests on pairs of networks:\r\n- TODO explain tests we have\r\n\r\n## Match\r\nFor two networks, we sometimes don't know the correspondence or _matching_ between a node in graph 1 and a node in graph 2. Often, knowing this correspondence is of interest in practical applications, or simply is useful for some downstream inference task. The `match` module allows the user to input two graphs, and get an estimate of a matching between the nodes of two networks. These tools also are more general than to just networks and can be used in general to find alignments of two matrices.\r\n- TODO explain the one tool in this module\r\n\r\n## Layouts\r\nPlotting a network in a sensible way is notoriously difficult as the number of nodes and edges grows. The `layouts` module contains methods for finding a reasonable 2D plot representation of the nodes and edges of a network, with tools for automatically coloring the nodes of a network by predicted community and other automated visual tweaks. \r\n- TODO explain what we have\r\n\r\n## Plot\r\n- TODO do\r\n\r\n## Nominate\r\n- TODO do\r\n\r\n## Utils\r\n- TODO do","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/828076272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/828077343","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/565#issuecomment-828077343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/565","id":828077343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyODA3NzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-28T01:44:29Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T01:44:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@dwaynepryce inspired by our conversation today I wrote down a rough draft of a high level overview of the whole package that I've been meaning to do for a while.

I envisioned this either being the landing page in the docs or at least being the \"introduction\" that comes right after the landing page. Perhaps this is too verbose but I also feel like if you are interested in a module, reading 5-6 sentences isn't that big of an ask? \r\n\r\nRegardless, feedback welcome (general or specific).
