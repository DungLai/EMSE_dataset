what do you think about adding ASE/LSE instead of n2v?\r\n\r\n@bdpedigo I think we should clarify what an \"automatic layout\" should have at the conceptual level. Automatic layout, to me, should be something that just takes a graph and spits out a reasonable and useful expression of it in 2d space with some colors that mean something, sizes that mean something, relative locations that mean something, and ... I think that's it.  Having used our layouts without `no overlaps` turned on, it was hard to get anything useful out of it?  Maybe there's a use that I'm not anticipating, though (e.g. maybe you want to handle overlaps by having a low alpha level so that super hot areas stack and look more vibrantly colored?)\r\n\r\nIt's worth a conversation!  I don't think I'm the best person to discuss all the ramifications of having a graph with tons of overlaps and anything principled.  Maybe @natoverse or our network visuals team would have some ideas on what it means to specifically want to opt into having overlaps?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/804296851/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4491883110,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ5MTg4MzExMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4491883110","actor":{"login":"bryantower","id":583566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzU2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/583566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower","html_url":"https://github.com/bryantower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T18:32:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4491883117,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0OTE4ODMxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4491883117","actor":{"login":"bryantower","id":583566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzU2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/583566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower","html_url":"https://github.com/bryantower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryantower/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T18:32:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4491883125,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ5MTg4MzEyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4491883125","actor":{"login":"natoverse","id":720083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDA4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/720083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse","html_url":"https://github.com/natoverse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natoverse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-22T18:32:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4491883131,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0OTE4ODMxMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4491883131","actor":{"login":"natoverse","id":72

I think in the above I mostly just meant \"layout\" so I will clarify my language above. For my use cases, I usually have node or edge metadata that I also want to understand, as well as a bunch of other considerations. So I think what I am more or less talking about is having many of the constituent parts for \"automatic layout\" actually exposed as functions so that someone who wants to do a deep dive/customize can play with them, but then of course we'll still have what you call \"automatic layout\" which is a 1-shot, reasonable default pipeline.\r\n\r\n> Having used our layouts without no overlaps turned on, it was hard to get anything useful out of it?\r\n\r\nAre you saying you're surprised I want the `no overlaps = off` option? Reasons for this are 1. removing overlaps is often much of the time it takes to do the whole pipeline in my experience with no-overlap stuff, 2. UMAP tends to produce layouts that don't overlap a crazy amount in my experience, and 3. (this is somewhat of a minor anticipated use case) if I see something weird in an embedding/layout I usually try turning off things, especially steps with randomness, and this is one of the things. To be clear, I think for a final product removing overlaps will often be best, but I don't think that's a reason to always force it to be on cause of the reasons above. \r\n\r\nAlso I'd just add that I've been able to get layouts I'm fairly happy with using ASE/UMAP and without no-overlap (tho I think the no-overlap code would improve this picture, that code isn't actually exposed in graspologic right now, so I haven't done it). see example below (please ignore the squigly lines on the border for the purposes of graph layout conversation).
