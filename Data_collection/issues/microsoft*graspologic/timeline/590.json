Briefly explain your changes.\r\n\r\nAdds a real-world multi-subject connectomics dataset ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307606?via%3Dihub)). \r\n- Connectomes are added as `edgelists`\r\n- Atlas information and _a priori_ block assignments for each ROI are included as CSVs\r\n- Anatomical features for each ROI in each connectome are also included\r\n- New function: `graspologic.datasets.load_mice` imports all data in this dataset as an `sklearn.utils.Bunch` object\r\n- Total dataset size is 15.8 MB\r\n\r\nAdds a tutorial notebook demonstrating analysis of this dataset using multiscale conparative connectomics methods ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14990)).\r\n- Tutorial is added under a new folder `connectomics`\r\n- Tutorial shows applications of many methods implemented in graspologic and hyppo, including omnibus embedding, cmbds embedding, k-sample testing, and plotting functions\r\n\r\n_Dataset Description_:\r\nDataset of 32 mouse connectomes derived from whole-brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of four distinct mouse genotypes: BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR), C57BL/6J(B6), CAST/EiJ (CAST), and DBA/2J (DBA2). For each strain, connectomes were generated from eight age-matched mice (N = 8 per strain), with a sex distribution of four males and four females. Each connectome was parcellated using asymmetric Waxholm Space, yielding a vertex set with a total of 332 regions of interest (ROIs) symmetrically distributed across the left and right hemispheres. Within a given hemisphere, there are seven superstructures consisting up multiple ROIs, resulting in a total of 14 distinct communities in each connectome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4173336713,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE3MzMzNjcxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/4173336713","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-06T04:22:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
