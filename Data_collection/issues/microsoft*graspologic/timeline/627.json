So it will just build the same documentation again.\r\n\r\n**IF** we were to pull our tutorials into an entirely separate github repository, we could include them in the main `graspologic` RTD project via the subprojects. That somewhat helps us, but it also means we'd have to split our repository and keep track of both things. I can do this, and I think I can do it reasonably quickly, but I wanted to see if you guys were okay with it.  It adds a cognitive hurdle for people to keep track of two repositories at a time, but it also means we're not cutting a new release just in case we update our tutorial documentation, and there's value in keeping them somewhat separate too.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @j1c

only concern is if RTD cant build the current docs due to limitations of the build environment, then i dont think separating into different repos will change the fact that RTD will still run out of memory when building the notebooks. FYI, I dont mind separate repos.\r\n\r\nThinking about the doc generation process a bit more, I realized we are building the docs 3 different times: 1) github actions, 2) netlify, 3) RTD. Currently, netlify is really just used for viewing the documentation builds on PRs, and I think RTD is for pushes to dev and main (?). Github actions, which does a build for every commit, seems to be able to build the docs relatively quickly (< 11 mins in current dev branch), suggesting machines provided for github actions is more than sufficient for graspologic at its current state. One potential solution is to use github actions to build and serve via github pages, rather than just build. We could have one action build docs without notebooks and another action build with notebooks, and push the outputs to the same branch (e.g. `gh-pages`). We would have to modify the `conf.py` accordingly to enable/disable nbsphinx ([link](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.0/never-execute.html)). Note that there is no way add in `conf.py` options when running the command `sphinx-build`. \r\n\r\nIf we want to continue using RTD, i think its better to have problematic notebooks precomputed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/757410276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/758109566","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627#issuecomment-758109566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627","id":758109566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODEwOTU2Ng==","user":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-11T17:38:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T17:38:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had typed up a big comment, but after typing it all out I think I'm just making this too difficult. It's probably better to just publish a redirect to our `gh-pages` and handle our own documentation needs that way.\r\n\r\nTo capture my thoughts:\r\n1: We should still split the documentation into reference generation and tutorial generation. This can lead to faster API development because we can get far faster feedback on when we horked something up in our apidocs than the 13 minutes or so it takes to build everything, but we still can run everything on PR.\r\n2: I'm concerned about any circular dependencies between our notebooks and our tutorials. Right now our reference docs reference the tutorials but not the other way around. If we're splitting these up we may run into problems if we do ever go both directions, because the process will have to be \"use intersphinx and the published objects.inv for each documentation artifact, but both require the other to have a reference to different things that haven't been built yet\".  So we should mandate a specific direction and stick with it at all times.\r\n3: Regarding the slow running tutorials - Github workflow actions have a time restriction of **6 hours**. This isn't a goal, because that would mean every PR will take 6 hours before checks even succeed, but it still means we aren't just buying ourselves a little time. That said, I still think we need to identify and address any of the long running tutorials if we can. I'm not sure what that looks like, though - I don't want to go around precomputing things because those inevitably get out of sync, which will be confusing. Maybe we select different data instead, if we can.  I wonder if we can get metrics on how long each individual notebook or better, every cell in every notebook, takes to run. I'm sure there are good reasons for some things to take too long so I don't want to enforce any broad rules, but it will at least give us something to look at and use to raise attention for the slow running tasks and see if there are better ways to do them. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I need to look into is if RTD will allow us to post a redirect to our `gh-pages` or not. We are also going to have problems with linking specific versions of the documentation - `dev` and `main` are easy enough, but each release will need to be captured and maintained, and if we ever get into a \"bugfixes on 0.1.x but also publishing 0.2.x\" scenario, we're going to have to account for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/758109566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/758110268","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627#issuecomment-758110268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627","id":758110268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODExMDI2OA==","user":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-11T17:39:54Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T17:39:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinxcontrib-versioning","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/758110268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/758116986","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627#issuecomment-758116986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/627","id":758116986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODExNjk4Ng==","user":{"login":"daxpryce","id":899411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpryce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpryce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-11T17:51:3
