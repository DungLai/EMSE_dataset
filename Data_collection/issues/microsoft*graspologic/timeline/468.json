need to build a new build pipeline for graspologic.\r\n\r\nIn general I prefer github actions, but Microsoft has some internal tools around dependency management/vetting/etc that are really useful, so it makes sense to build it for an Azure DevOps Pipeline.  This pipeline will have a yaml file checked into Github but the actual build for it will take place in a private Devops instance without public visibility into the runs.  \r\n\r\nThings to ensure we do upon build:\r\n- Run unit tests\r\n- Run unit test coverage\r\n- Run mypy \r\n- Run flake8 or black - we should have a discussion on what black offers (I'm unfamiliar with it)\r\n- Run sphinx with warnings set to fail the build\r\n\r\nIf those all succeed and it's a merge to dev, we also want to publish to pypi as a pre-release.\r\n\r\nIf those all succeed and it's a merge to main, we want to publish to pypi as a final release.  Maybe we can also figure out how to update our semver bugfix revision up one on a merge to main and submit it as an auto-created PR so we can accept that into dev asap with minimal human intervention.  Doing it via PR vs. trying to do it automatically means we can override the next version from a bugfix version to a minor release if we see the need.\r\n\r\nSome niceties that can probably be broken out into a different process: it would be *awesome* if we could execute all of our tutorial jupyter notebooks and verify they work on each build.  It would likewise be awesome if we could store this output .ipynb file somewhere for pretty rendering of some sort, especially if we can make use of the built-in Github viewer (so we don't have to manage any of our own servers for it).
