The issue with this is that then the label of `latent_left` doesn't really reflect what's in that variable, but I think the other option is to add a new instance variable for the concatenated matrix.

I'd say for now, don't actually change any of the class attributes. just change what would be returned by `fit_transform`. @j1c let me know if you disagree, I just wanted to have some way of doing this because I so often do `np.concatenate((X, Y), axis=1)` and also because this is what topologic does by default so I'd like to as least have it in as an option going forward.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. Maybe set to True by default?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/689066477/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3742339304,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc0MjMzOTMwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3742339304","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-08T18:46:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3742339305,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NDIzMzkzMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3742339305","actor":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-08T18:46:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"spencer-loggia","id":36051767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDUxNzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36051767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia","html_url":"https://github.com/spencer-loggia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencer-loggia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-08T19:06:05Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T19:06:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/pull/433","id":696107734,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgyMjM5

An optional parameter `concat` (default False) is added to  `baseEmbed.__init__`,  as well as the `__init__`  methods of it's children. When `baseEmbed.fit_transform_` is called and  concat is true,  returns the left and right latent matrices concatenated on axis 1. If `concat` is False it behaves the same as before, and returns a tuple of the left and right latent matrices. \r\n\r\nAlso add tests of directed embedding to `test_spectral_embed.py` and `test_omni.py`, and refactors `test_mase` to make use of new concat parameter.
