request issue to sklearn)\r\n\r\ntitle: Gaussian Mixture with BIC/AIC\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you want to propose a new algorithm, please refer first to the scikit-learn\r\ninclusion criterion:\r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Describe the workflow you want to enable\r\nClustering with Gaussian mixture modeling frequently entails choosing the best model parameter such as the number of components and covariance constraint. This [demonstration](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/mixture/plot_gmm_selection.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-mixture-plot-gmm-selection-py)  is very helpful to me but I think it might be great to have a class like `LassoLarsIC` that does the job automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Describe your proposed solution\r\nAdd a class (say `GaussianMixtureIC`, for example) that automatically selects the best GM model based on BIC or AIC among a set of models. As mentioned above, the set of models would be parameterized by:\r\n- Initialization scheme, which could be random, k-means or agglomerative clusterings (as done in `mclust`, see below)\r\n- Covariance constraints\r\n- Number of components\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\n`mclust` is a package in R for GM modeling.

to briefly clarify the mclust algorithm (what we are proposing to implement here):\r\n\r\n1. run agglomerative clustering (with different options for linkage, affinity, etc.) to generate a set of initial labelings. The same run of agglomerative clustering can be used for various levels of `n_components`.\r\n2. fit `GaussianMixtures` using the various different parameters. roughly this amounts to sweeping over `{initializations} x {n_components} x {covariance types}`. \r\n3. choose the best model based on BIC.\r\n\r\nAs far as we can tell, the above isn't trivially accomplished with `GridSearchCV` for a few reasons (some of which were already mentioned above, but just repeating here for clarity):\r\n- Running agglomerative clustering with multiple different settings, then extracting the appropriate \"flat\" clustering for the right value of `n_components` is not hard, but does take a bit of code.\r\n- Computing the initial parameters given these clusterings also takes a bit of code, as `GaussianMixture` currently can only be initialized by the means, precisions, and weights and not by the responsibilities (e.g. cluster labels for each point like agglomerative gives us).\r\n- There is no cross-validation involved, meaning one would have to use the \"dummy\" cross-validation solution described above.\r\n- (maybe) there are also some details about how mclust handles the covariance regularization which don't lend themselves to naive grid search easily. \r\n\r\nWe are more than happy to talk about details of how to best implement the above, should it be desired in sklearn. We do think that the functionality above is (1) useful, given the success of mclust (for instance mclust had [168k downloads last month](https://mclust-org.github.io/mclust/), and the >3600 citations mentioned above), and (2) not currently easy to run in sklearn with the given tools like `GridSearchCV` given all of the reasons above. While it wouldn't be impossible for a user to do it that way, there are enough steps involved (and would require the user to be pretty familiar with mclust already) that  we thought a specific class to wrap up all of the above would be convenient and useful for the community. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/776739879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/800252741","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/601#issuecomment-800252741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/601","id":800252741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDI1Mjc0MQ==","user":{"login":"tliu68","id":54865879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68","html_url":"https://github.com/tliu68","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tliu68/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T13:21:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T16:22:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"To clarify what we think is going on with the failing checks.

greatly appreciate your interest in our algorithm and your help in improving the code! However, we believe that `scikit-learn` users might benefit more if the code were integrated into the main package instead of `scikit-learn-extra` due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- our code deals with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM), a fundamental tool in clustering, and automates the model selection process documented in `scikit-learn`. Inspired by `mclust`, our code also enables initialization with `agglomerative clustering`, which is not yet an option in the default `scikit-learn` model selection scheme for GMM.\r\n- to our knowledge, our code is the first and only Python version of `mclust` which is one of the most widely used clustering packages in R, downloaded about 110k times last month and cited by over 3600 publications (Banfield & Raftery, 1993; Scrucca et al., 2016).\r\n\r\nGiven that our code could be used in either a basic or more advanced GMM model selection scheme, we believe that it could be of general interest to the `scikit-learn` users.
