NIST also provides some options (see [here](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section4/prc46.htm#Example)), but these result in multiple comparisons per edge and that'll just nuke the power of this test\r\n3d. did connectomics D&D ever reach a conclusion on this point?\r\n4. there is also the option of letting the user pick the test they want to use... i don't like it because handling many different APIs might get messy. what do you think?\r\n5. regardless of which test we go with, have `EdgeTest.test()` return a p-value for each edge!\r\n\r\n### VertexTest\r\n1. initialize `VertexTest` with a list of $n$ graphs and a list of $n$ corresponding class labels\r\n2. allow the user to optionally do any graph preprocessing available in `graspy` (i.e. ptr, diagonal augmentation, centering). note that diagonal augmentation and centering are not yet implemented, so i will add those to the `utils` submodule\r\n3. embed the graphs using `omni` (@v715 figure out what to do if graphs are directed)\r\n4. for each vertex, test for significant differences using statsmodels' MANOVA and have `VertexTest().test` return a p-value for each vertex\r\n\r\n### BlockTest\r\n1. initialize `BlockTest` with a list of $n$ graphs and a list of $n$ corresponding class labels, and an _a priori_ block label\r\n2. two tests are going to be implemented here\r\n2a. univariate test: for each block, calculate the average edge weight for each group, use MGC to test for differences across groups\r\n2b. multivariate test: for each block, vectorize the block, use MGC to test for differences across groups\r\n3. for both tests, have `EdgeTest.test()` return a p-value for each block\r\n\r\n## Other nice things to have\r\n- add a function that plots ranked p-values + bonferroni correction\r\n- add the autism mouse data set so people have a k-sample connectome data set to play with\r\n- add tutorial notebooks demonstrating the use of each of these functions on the autism mouse data\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/611029492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eigenvivek","id":29757116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzU3MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29757116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek","html_url":"https://github.com/eigenvivek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3214664766,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIxNDY2NDc2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3214664766","actor":{"login":"eigenvivek","id":29757116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzU3MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29757116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek","html_url":"https://github.com/eigenvivek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T15:34:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3214664769,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMTQ2NjQ3Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/3214664769","actor":{"login":"eigenvivek","id":29757116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzU3MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29757116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek","html_url":"https://github.com/eigenvivek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eigenvivek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T15:34:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/611171386","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/330#issuecomment-611171386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/330","id":611171386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTE3MTM4Ng==","user":{"login":"j1c","id":5142539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5142539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c","html_url":"https://github.com/j1c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j1c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T20:17:14Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T20:17:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Looks
