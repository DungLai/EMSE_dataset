this in mind, it would also be useful to add an internal `graph` model with `vertices` and `adjacency matrix` attributes, so that you can keep track of which vertices are associated with the LCC, and also a utility that accepts in a `n` list of `v x v` adjacency matrices/ `n` list of networkx graphs/3D array `n x v x v` for `n` graphs with `v` vertices, and computes the LCC of the whole collection
