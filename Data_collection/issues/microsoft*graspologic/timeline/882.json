align them with Procrustes, but not sure if that's more effort than it's worth","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/964611337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"loftusa","id":12386450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12386450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa","html_url":"https://github.com/loftusa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/965131815","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882#issuecomment-965131815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882","id":965131815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM7Erc45hr4n","user":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T13:20:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T13:20:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"the nice thing is that you can actually align the decomposed $R$ matrices, which we thought should be easier.\r\n\r\nhowever, for the purposes of this issue, my vote would simply be we close this issue until someone has a compelling case for the right thing to do. currently this feels like something we could reach to implement but it might not be super trustworthy, and given the current code, someone who is familiar with this algorithm could do it themselves with a little bit of work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/965131815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/965553818","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882#issuecomment-965553818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/882","id":965553818,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM7Erc45jS6a","user":{"login":"loftusa","id":12386450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12386450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa","html_url":"https://github.com/loftusa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loftusa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T17:07:57Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T17:07:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sounds
