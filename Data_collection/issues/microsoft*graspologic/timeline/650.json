If it's as simple as twine uploading to a different location that's fine - maybe instead of treating this as a code / PR thing you just treat it as a fact finding mission and I'll go through the process of setting up an account with conda forge and whatnot?  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll verify that it does indeed need to be me or another MSFT employee that owns the account we publish

 It sounds like it's not as self-serve as pypi (in that we'll have to push the recipe to that repo and create a PR and a human will validate and merge it eventually).  That can certainly be done, but I wouldn't want to do it for all our dev, non-release builds, and it also sounds like sometimes PRs fall through the cracks and we have to manually ask them to look at it to put it back on their radar.  I think we can make that work but given all of these non-automatic processes, I'm not going to commit to saying we should do `conda forge` as a first class citizen.  Best effort, sure, but it's a pretty heavy onerous lift compared to our fully automated deployment process to pypi.  \r\n\r\nStill, we can give it our best effort and try to stay on top of all PRs into conda-forge.  It would be nice if we could identify a cadre of conda users who could focus on shepherding this through each time we do a release.\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind is that we haven't even released a final build yet - we're still releasing with `dev` tags to PyPI.  We're basically ready for `0.1.0`, but we need to write up some release notes and do a final scan of things before we do it (#653 is the sort of thing we should have fixed before we tell people to use us with a 0.1.0 release).\r\n\r\nThe good news is that tracking down things like #653 gives us some time to get this working for conda _as well_.  We are going to have to do the same with [graspologic-native](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic-native) - and do it first, prior to doing it with graspologic.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to be able spend much time on this this week, but I _will_ send the current dependency list from a fresh venv in a few minutes and respond back with that
