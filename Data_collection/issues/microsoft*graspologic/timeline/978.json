are correct, because of some changes to the base class a separate fit/transform was added when it should not have been (see https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/797)\r\n\r\na transform (for new graph(s)) could absolutely be implemented. I can show you how to do it given a network and the V matrices (or it may be mentioned in the original paper) if having a transform is important for your application. And we could totally add it to graspologic as well, but we'd just need to sketch out an API for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/1199898483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/1200409541","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/issues/978#issuecomment-1200409541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/978","id":1200409541,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCM7Erc5HjMvF","user":{"login":"dokato","id":4547289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDcyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4547289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato","html_url":"https://github.com/dokato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dokato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-31T11:54:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T11:54:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks Ben, I can help with adding that.
