@bdpedigo I was just following the tutorial which used graspy specifically. Would switching to graspology make a difference?\r\n\r\nWe are no longer supporting/maintaining graspy (the name more or less just changed to graspologic), most things should still work if you just change graspy -> graspologic. Which tutorial are you trying to follow? \r\n\r\nAgain, not sure that this is causing this particular issue though. One thing I could suggest is creating a new conda environment and specifying a few dependencies: \r\n\r\n`conda create -n <new env> numba llvmlite scikit-learn scipy numpy`\r\n\r\nafter that you can `pip install graspologic` and see if it works. \r\n\r\nthough @daxpryce I think has seen an issue similar to this so he may have better

for letting us know @victoris93!\r\n\r\nIn general, trying to troubleshoot a global(ish) environment is super challenging.  For issues like this, we really would like to ask you to:\r\n- create a new virtual environment or conda equivalent\r\n- Install only graspologic\r\n- Replicate that you cannot import graspologic (or, specifically, the import statement that blew up catastrophically in your older environment)\r\n\r\nThat's a good starting point for us as we start our search.  If it's doing it in the fresh environment, and it's a python+os+platform configuration we support, then that is 100% on us (even if it's a dependency of ours, we still have a responsibility to find a work around or replace the library, which... is not awesome, but we can't let downstream deps make us stop working in a fresh install!)  \r\n\r\nIf it's _not_ doing it in the fresh environment, then it gives us a place where we can compare the deltas in `pip list` (or conda equivalent (???? I don't use conda so... my nomenclature is probably off)) between the two environments so we try to hypothesize some reasons for why it's not working for you and try to work through them.\r\n\r\nI'm going to mark this as closed **for the moment**, but if you get to a point where you want to try to dig into this some more, feel free to reopen this ticket, or open a new one and reference this one so we can try to pull together all the information you've already provided.
