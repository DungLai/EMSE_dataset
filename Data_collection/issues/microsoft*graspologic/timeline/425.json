some things I have been thinking about: \r\n1. decide whether we want to support a function API\r\n2. I think init keyword \"rand\" should be \"random\" \r\n3. I think the docs for `.fit` and `.fit_predict` specifically need to clarify which matrix is being permuted. I always have to look elsewhere for this info and I think putting in fit is worth doing. \r\n4. related to the above, we should try to standardize which matrix is \"source\" and which is \"target\" as much as possible. functions that do similar things in spirit below. what i mean by similar is all of them take in two matrices, and try to align one to the other, and it matters which matrix is the one \"being matched\". can we audit those 3 places and make sure we are doing the same thing? and if those conventions differ, lets talk about which would be best for us?\r\n   - QAP in scipy\r\n   -

wanted to bring this up again - what do you think of a function API closer to what the scipy implementation is like right now? Is there any advantage to having a class currently? \r\n\r\nmy thoughts on having classes has evolved to be more about \"will this object ever take unseen data and operate on it.\" In the case of graph matching, I think the answer is almost always no (e.g. apply the permutation learned between A and B on C). And if someone wanted to do that, they'd always have the permutation indices...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/comments/944440405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5470881892,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCM7Erc4pX072zwAAAAFGFwhk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/5470881892","actor":{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-15T16:36:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5470881899,"node_id":"SE_lADOCM7Erc4pX072zwAAAAFGFwhr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/5470881899","actor":{"login":"asaadeldin11","id":54996865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTk2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54996865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11","html_url":"https://github.com/asaadeldin11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaadeldin11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-15T16:36:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T15:21:02Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T15:21:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960/comments","event

the change to the API backwards compatible?\r\n      - Very much no \r\n- [x] Have you built the documentation (reference and/or tutorial) and verified the generated documentation is

multigraph graph matching (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02572)\r\n- Adds functionality for graph matching via optimal transport as an option (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05366)\r\n- Adds support for sparse matrix inputs\r\n- Adds support for between-graph connection matching (see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.19.492713)\r\n- Fixes a bug in the current implementation when using seeds AND similarity matrix (see #959)\r\n- Changes the API for graph matching\r\n   - Is now a function, not a class\r\n   - Outputs two sets of indices, one for the first graph and one for the second. This is more intuitive for when the graphs are of different sizes, regardless of the order in which they are input.\r\n\r\n#### Design decisions\r\n- I opted to use a function rather than a class for the user-facing graph matching tools. This is because graph matching is not exactly a \"model,\" or in other words I think people would be very unlikely to ever \"fit\" a permutation to one pair of graphs and then \"predict\" using the estimated permutation on another. \r\n- I tried to make the interface somewhat like https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment.html in the sense that I am now outputing *two* sets of indices, but here the first one corresponds to the input matrix `A` and the second to the input matrix `B`. For cases where the two matrices are the same, then the first set of indices is basically worthless: it will always be just the sorted indices of `A`, or in otherwords `np.arange(n)`. This is much like what happens with `linear_sum_assignment` in scipy. However, for differently sized matrices (in particular when `A` is bigger than `B`), then not everyone in `A` will get a match, so this matters. See https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic/discussions/925 for some discussion (it was confusing what happens with differently sized matrices).\r\n- I added some better logging/timing features because I often want to know what aspects of the algorithm are taking a long time when I'm matching large matrices.\r\n- I opted to add the `transport` functionality simply as extra parameters - this is mainly because all of the other parameters would be the same, and I felt it would be annoying to have a completely separate function to do this small adjustment to the matching algorithm.\r\n   - The downside is that this adds several parameters to the algorithm which wont matter when `transport=False`. Tons of parameters can be lame. But I did try to alleviate this by labeling those parameters with the `transport_` prefix.\r\n- I opted to only support the `numpy.random.Generator` syntax. This is because the `RandomState` syntax is considered legacy by numpy so I don't think any new code should bend over backwards to support it, IMO https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/legacy.html#legacy\r\n- I opted to use for loops for the multigraph cases for readability and compatibility with sparse arrays/matrices. There is a way to do similar operations with `np.einsum` but it is very hard to read and reason about, IMO.\r\n- I changed how the input initialization is specified because I did not like having a single parameter that could be a string, array, or float (which was tough to reason about internally). \r\n- Rather than shuffle the entire input matrix to begin with as we did in the past, I simply shuffle/unshuffle every time `linear_sum_assignment` is called, since this is the only place this matters. I think the computational cost of the shuffle is minimal, and this makes the rest of the code easier to reason about since we dont have as many shuffle/unshuffle operations to do.\r\n   - I almost wanted to do the same for the seed/unseed stuff, but I didn't go that far.\r\n- Decided to axe adding numba for now, just want to get in what we have here so far. Will make a new issue and revisit, potentially.\r\n\r\n#### Remaining work [Done now]\r\nThis is currently a work in progress, making the PR to document progress and what needs to be done: \r\n- [x] implement padding\r\n- [x] implement wrapper function(s)\r\n- [x] implement computation of \"score\" (objective function value)\r\n- [x] type-hints\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [x] documentation\r\n- [x] implement handling of outlier cases (such as all nodes are seeded) \r\n- [x] tutorials updated accordingly\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/960/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7289810034,"node_id":"CE_lADOCM7Erc4pX072zwAAAAGygaxy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/graspologic/issues/events/7289810034","actor":{"login":"bdpedigo","id":25714207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzE0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25714207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo","html_url":"https://github.com/bdpedigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdpedigo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-30T17:59:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
