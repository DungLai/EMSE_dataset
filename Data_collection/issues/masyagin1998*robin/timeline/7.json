You can't make it fully automatized. Best way is to process images with neural network with existing waits, and than find \"bad\" parts of images and process them by your hand. So You combine work of neural network and your own hand-work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/masyagin1998/robin/issues/comments/536191557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"masyagin1998","id":25647501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjQ3NTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25647501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998","html_url":"https://github.com/masyagin1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2713402710,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcxMzQwMjcxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/masyagin1998/robin/issues/events/2713402710","actor":{"login":"masyagin1998","id":25647501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjQ3NTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25647501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998","html_url":"https://github.com/masyagin1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masyagin1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-15T10:18:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
