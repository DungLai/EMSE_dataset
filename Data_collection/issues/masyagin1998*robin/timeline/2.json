After it's running You'll get `src/dataset/output` directory with training data. \r\n3) You should move `src/dataset/output` to `src/unet/input`.

Thank you for your hard work,\r\nIssue:\r\n\r\n1. One of the biggest issues currently facing ESFNet is not being able to train & predict\r\n **High-resolution images** without loading the entire image into the memory.\r\n\r\n2. Also, the images used for training & prediction are **Multi-resolution images**, they don't have identical `Hight x Width`.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n1. **Create cropped Patches** from the original High-resolution image in both training & prediction.\r\nThis will allow images to be processed without throttling the memory.\r\n2. **Also add margins** to the cropped patches to avoid border effects.\r\n\r\nNote: an implementation of the suggested solution is already available at the [Robin repository.](https://github.com/masyagin1998/robin)\r\n- In-which [dataset.py](https://github.com/masyagin1998/robin/issues/2#issuecomment-449625518) creates patches with margins using the input images \r\n- Then train using train.py\r\n- Finally, run binarize.py which takes input high-resolution multisized images, and recognizes it from it's patches.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your reply\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrluin/ESFNet-Pytorch/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrluin/ESFNet-Pytorch/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
