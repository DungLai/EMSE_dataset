I appreciate it. I'm trying to create a python package for robin. I tried to add LFS support to upload the weight file(for running tests), but it seems we can't have LFS support to public forks if the original repo doesn't have it https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1906 . It would be great if you could add it. \r\n\r\nCould you also add some kinda format for referring the code in the README.md?\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards ","closed_by":{"login":"vkolagotla","id":23280093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgwMDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23280093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla","html_url":"https://github.com/vkolagotla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkolagotla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/masyagin1998/robin/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/masyagin1998/robin/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
