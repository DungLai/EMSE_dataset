What exactly was the issue?\r\nI recognize that \"the PDF words, the 1, 2, and 3 appear, whereas they do not in the HTML.\" but I couldn't see that \"this is causing a mismatch of words when doing the visual parse\".\r\n\r\n[md.xml.txt](https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/files/4739033/md.xml.txt) is the output of `pdftotext -bbox-layout md.pdf md.xml.txt`.\r\nAccording to this, the `Sentence` for \"One\" has the following bbox.\r\n```\r\n<line xMin=\"83.000000\" yMin=\"155.556641\" xMax=\"114.992188\" yMax=\"168.845703\">\r\n   <word xMin=\"83.000000\" yMin=\"155.556641\"

@HiromuHota ,\r\n\r\nI think this issue is about word mismatch between HTML and PDF documents. In this case, some words appear in PDF but not in HTML such as `1`, `2`, and `3` and the order of words is not consistent in both documents. These two problems are causing word matching issues for visual linker. The reason for these problems is that we use different software to generate different types of documents (PDFs and HTMLs). The ideal case would be using the character-level parser to parse coordinates and document structure instead of existing tools such as Adobe.

you guys for your recollections.\r\nI think the 1st problem is easier to solve but the 2nd one is much harder or even **wouldn't fix**.\r\nThey would never be guaranteed to be consistent as HTML does not convey how exactly (at the pixel level) it is rendered and displayed.\r\n\r\nThe visual linker is supposed to link words between HTML and PDF.\r\nDepending on your use case, the original source could be HTML or PDF as illustrated below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20668349/84177000-16c2a680-aa37-11ea-9762-03f860c34195.png)\r\n\r\nIf I could take one step further of what @SenWu suggested, I'd suggest to embed the coordinates into a HTML (maybe we should call this XML by then). As a result,\r\n1. Fonduer `Parser` takes coordinates if they are embedded in HTML and attaches them to `Sentence` (and other data models like `Cell` and `Table`).\r\n2. The current visual linker is separated as a utility function that can be used as a preprocessing before parser.\r\n\r\nBy this change, users would be supposed to embed coordinates in HTML on other own (they can use the visual linker but it's totally up to them).\r\nA bonus is that Fonduer would become conceptually easier to understand because the `Parser` treats HTML as a single source of all modal information.\r\n\r\nFYI, one of my use cases is to extract information from scanned documents. So the source is PDF (more specifically, a scanned image in PDF, or non-searchable PDF).\r\nBy applying OCR, I make searchable PDF. Then I use `pdftotext` to generate HTML (XML actually, e.g., the `md.xml.txt` in

some words, the visual position data (using sentence.top, for example) is not accurate. This falls outside of the domain of the edge case of sentences being next to the edge of a page or spanning over different pages; even in the middle of a page, two words that are aligned horizontally may end up having drastically different tops.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be mostly the case with top and bottom properties, or at least it is more reasonably easy to find out the discrepancies there.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Preprocess any document\r\n- Query the Sentences in the Document, and save a slice of about 20 or so\r\n- For each Sentence, print sentence.top and compare the values to the document\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\"visit.\" was in a Document I parsed, for which sentence.bottom yielded [292, 154] and sentence.top yielded [282, 144]. It is clear they are visibly aligned on the bottom, instead of 138 pixels apart as the visual data suggests.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nFor the example, we would expect sentence.bottom to yield almost identical values. As for the rest of the data, it seems very inconsistent. Some sentences offer a very accurate representation of each word's position, some suggest that words are spread hundreds of pixels apart when they are aligned.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n - OS:
