created a custom MLflow model to package a (trained) Fonduer model.\r\nIn addition to packaging, this custom model can be used to serve the packaged model.\r\n\r\nCurrently this custom MLflow model includes some hard-coded part, hence needs cleanup; but I'd love to contribute it to the community if it is useful for other people.\r\n@SenWu @trungtv, let us know your
