basically, both MonkeyType and PyAnnotate do the same thing: 1. collect types at runtime and 2. insert collected types to the source code.\r\nI ran `pytest tests` with each but none of the two traced the calls of Fonduer methods because `pytest tests` ran against the Fonduer package installed in site-packages, which is ignored by MonkeyType and PyAnnotate by default.\r\nFortunately, MonkeyType takes care of such a case by specifying the package to be traced in an environment variable (see [here](https://monkeytype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#i-run-tests-against-my-package-installed-in-site-packages-and-i-get-no-traces)).\r\n\r\nThe following works with Fonduer,\r\n\r\n1.
