And we send the labeling function names and outputs to snorkel to calculate the weak labels which cause your error if you have some labeling function always return ABSTAIN.\r\n\r\nFYI: Fonduer gradually updates labeling function outputs which means if you update the only results or add new results (it won't clear existing results by default). If you want to clear all existing results you can call the  `clear()` function.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSen
