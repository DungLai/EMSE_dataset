`tests/test_postgres.py::test_cand_gen_cascading_delete`.\r\nBefore this fixing, this test code tried delete query for deleting one data from PartTemp table, but sqlalchemy create unexecutable query to refer `candidate.id` from PartTemp table although this query does not use `candidate.id`.\r\nFix is changing query builder codes not to refer `candidate.id`.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nExecute `tests/test_postgres.py::test_cand_gen_cascading_delete`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst
