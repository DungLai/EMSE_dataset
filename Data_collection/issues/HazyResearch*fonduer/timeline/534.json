Proposal defines bbox of 'AB' as a multi line word (i.e. left is min left of ['A','B'], top is the top of 'A', right is max right of ['A','B'] and bottom is the bottom of 'B'). \r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nThis is cause of Japanese morphological analysis. So, I have added  Japanese test data to 'tests/data/hocr_simple/japan.hocr' and test code to 'tests/parser/test_parser.py::test_parse_hocr'\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the

Description of the problems or issues\r\n\r\n**Is your pull request related to a problem?

Proposal defines bbox of 'AB' as a multi line word (i.e. left is min left of ['A','B'], top is the top of 'A', right is max right of ['A','B'] and bottom is the bottom of 'B').\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nThis is cause of Japanese morphological analysis. So, I have added Japanese test data to 'tests/data/hocr_simple/japan.hocr' and test code to 'tests/parser/test_parser.py::test_parse_hocr'\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the

Description of the problems or issues\r\n\r\n**Is your pull request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nSee #534.\r\nThis request redoes #537, which needs prior fixing #538 (fixed by #539).\r\n\r\n**Does your pull request fix any issue.**\r\nSee #534\r\n\r\n## Description of the proposed changes\r\nIn case of multi line Japanese strings 'AAAA\\nBBBB', spacy[ja] sometimes generates tokens ['AAA', 'AB', 'B', 'BB']. Proposal defines bbox of 'AB' as a multi line word (i.e. left is min left of ['A','B'], top is the top of 'A', right is max right of ['A','B'] and bottom is the bottom of 'B').\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\nThis is cause of Japanese morphological analysis. So, I have added Japanese test data to 'tests/data/hocr_simple/japan.hocr' and test code to 'tests/parser/test_parser.py::test_parse_hocr'\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst accordingly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4729492009,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDcyOTQ5MjAwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/4729492009","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b0154c36b4feeda2e81ad7dd9af7062762dad3bf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/commits/b0154c36b4feeda2e81ad7dd9af7062762dad3bf","created_at":"2021-05-11T17:02:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
