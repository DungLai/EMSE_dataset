So yes, much less or even no lock contention at the database.\r\nThe downside is that there will be an overhead in object transfer from each UDF to the UDFRunner, which I hope is less expensive than the database lock.\r\n\r\nAlso we have to be careful not to run out of memory when a large corpus is processed.\r\n\r\nAs you have noticed, the architecture looks like a Map-Reduce (mapper: each UDF and reducer: UDFRunner).\r\nActually, the snorkel-extraction does exactly this. You can see it at
