An `Engine` and a connection are created when starting a child process within the parent process (note that `UDF.__init__()` is actually executed within the parent process).\r\nhttps://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/b6bd723cedeae747f90fbe732a350ad6636f1af6/src/fonduer/utils/udf.py#L201\r\n2. Even after the child process terminates, this connection (created in the parent process) remains in the connection pool (referred to by the `Engine`) until the `Engine` is garbage-collected (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html#engine-disposal).\r\n3. PostgreSQL raises an error when the total number of connections (=`PARALLEL` created at `parser.apply` + `PARALLEL` created at `mention_extractor.apply` + ...) exceeds the max number of postgresql.\r\n\r\nThis would not happen when there is a wait, long enough that the `Engine` is garbage-collected, between each `.apply`
