[...] In the tutorial notebooks, it looks like both html files and pdf files are processed together, but I was wondering how I would go about parsing sentences for only pdf files.\r\n\r\n**TLDR: For now, you'll need to get an HTML representation of your PDF documents using a third party tool like Adobe Acrobat. We're working on making this a more seamless process in the future.**\r\n\r\nYour observation here is also correct. To give you a bit more context, the way that Fonduer is currently built expects that there is an HTML representation of all PDF input documents. In our experiments, we previously had used Adobe Acrobat to convert PDFs to HTML, with reasonably good results. Others have also used tools from ABBYY to get the HTML representation to go along with the PDF files. \r\n\r\nAn HTML representation allows us to extraction structural/tabular information more easily than trying to do so directly from the PDF and also helps us deal with some of the nuanced corner cases involved in parsing PDF files.\r\n\r\nHowever, Adobe can be quite a bottleneck. Acrobat Pro has a memory leak when converting documents, and performs quite slowly, making converting a large PDF corpus to HTML quite a painful process. [pdftotree](https://github.com/HazyResearch/pdftotree) is our current effort to eliminate the need for proprietary tools like Adobe by constructing a document structure ourselves from the raw PDF. Ultimately, [pdftotree](https://github.com/HazyResearch/pdftotree) will be used in Fonduer to preprocess PDFs when necessary so that users do not need to supply their own HTML representations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/410139180/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1769120622,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc2OTEyMDYyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/1769120622","actor":{"login":"Allen8838","id":35154803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTU0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35154803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838","html_url":"https://github.com/Allen8838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-03T04:11:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1769120623,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NjkxMjA2MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/1769120623","actor":{"login":"Allen8838","id":35154803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTU0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35154803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838","html_url":"https://github.com/Allen8838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Allen8838/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-03T04:11:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1769120806,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3NjkxMjA4MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/1769120806","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-03T04:12:04Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1769121424,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNzY5MTIxNDI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/1769121424"
