switches our CI/CD from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nFor documentation purposes, some of the reasons we wanted to switch are:\r\n* tighter integration with GitHub\r\n* better performance (faster tests by a few mins)\r\n* more resources for VMs (e.g., memory, cores, esp. for macOS)\r\n\r\nThere are some downsides in that the documentation is not as good as Travis-CI, a commit must be used to trigger a build, and there are some quirks with the environments (e.g., using the tmate action doesn't give you the same environment as just running GitHub action directly). But, overall, it seems like a reasonable switch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/612322688","html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/371#issuecomment-612322688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/371","id":612322688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjMyMjY4OA==","user":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-11T04:25:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T04:25:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
