However, from your description, I do not think Fonduer is the right tool for you. Fonduer allows you to extract specific relations from richly formatted data. It does not allow you to transform arbitrary tables in richly formatted data into a structured format like PostgreSQL. \r\n\r\n>when i was trying to understand fonduer flow, i found it keeping data in terms of phrases in \"Phrase\" table with keeping all track. but to solve my/above issue how can this going to helpful ?\r\n\r\nPlease check out our [blog post](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/fonduer.html) and/or [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05028) to see more details about Fonduer's pipeline and the tasks that it solves. You can also check the [fonduer tutorials](https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer-tutorials) for a walk-through. You can learn more about the data model in Section 3.1 of the paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/388127835/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1620309307,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTYyMDMwOTMwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/1620309307","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-10T17:42:14Z","rename":{"from":"why
