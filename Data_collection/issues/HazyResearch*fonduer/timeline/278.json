Then are wanted to test something with document set `B` (which are not documents, not overlapping with `A`)? \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand the scenario in which you want to evaluate new documents, but will not need to go through the process of parsing and everything again.\r\n\r\nWe do not currently have a way to delete a document directly. But, I'd assume that what you would want to do is to clean up your datasets (e.g. ensure no duplicates or overlaps in those sets) rather than trying to delete documents from the database just to reparse/add them.

@lukehsiao, here are the details:\r\n\r\nI need to use Fonduer in a real-world application, where a Fonduer trained model is saved on some server and users can upload new documents to get information

model. \r\n\r\nBut a user can run the test many times with the same documents, which results in errors with Fonduer. I myself, when developing the system, was testing many times with on same new documents. I needed a way to remove those documents, handle the error that Document already exists, and start fresh. \r\n\r\nI found a way around this by creating a copy of the original database every time a test on new documents starts.
