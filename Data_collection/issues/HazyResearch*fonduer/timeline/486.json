which is the root cause of #482.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nThe tests in this repository could not reproduce #482.\r\nThis is because #482 is a race-condition, while `test_e2e` uses only `max_docs = 12`, which turned out  not to be big enough to reproduce this issue.\r\nThe hardware tutorial uses `max_docs = 100` and can reproduce it (https://github.com/HiromuHota/fonduer-tutorials/runs/879864413).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n* [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n* [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n* [ ] I have updated the CHANGELOG.rst accordingly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3573472058,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NzM0NzIwNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3573472058","actor":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"511eb6455c58b66a810a5a163bad05f2249e2714","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HiromuHota/fonduer-tutorials/commits/511eb6455c58b66a810a5a163bad05f2249e2714","created_at":"2020-07-21T23:17:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/662613054","html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/486#issuecomment-662613054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/486","id":662613054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjYxMzA1NA==","user":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T18:26:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T18:26:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
