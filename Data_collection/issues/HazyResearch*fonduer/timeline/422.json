your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIt'd be good to have a guideline for what the docstring should look like.\r\nThe following is my work-in-progress guideline\r\n\r\n```\r\nDocstring format\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nWe use Sphinx as our Docstring format.\r\nAccording to Sphinx, `:type` and `:rtype` are optional, but are not allowed in Fonduer.\r\ndocstring should look like as follows:\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    from typing import Union\r\n\r\n    def format_unit(value: Union[float, int], unit: str) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"Format the given value as a human readable string using the given units.\r\n\r\n        :param value: a numeric value\r\n        :param unit: the unit for the value (kg, m, etc.)\r\n        :return: a human readable string using the given units\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        return '{} {}'.format(value, unit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a section like above to `docs/dev/codestyle.rst`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUse docstring style checker that can check our format.\r\nThere are nice docstring checkers like pydocstyle (this can be used via flake8-docstrings), but I don't think they can check a docstring in such a detail (e.g., check if :type exists).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #422 and #66.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3379819328,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzNzk4MTkzMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3379819328","actor":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"195ccb4d57608520962718037582bf5f602edec5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HiromuHota/fonduer/commits/195ccb4d57608520962718037582bf5f602edec5","created_at":"2020-05-27T19:49:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3380205784,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM4MDIwNTc4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3380205784","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-27T21:48:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3380205850,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzODAyMDU4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3380205850","actor":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bd79688230ba11f5ed97e58cc78548de14b2c3db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/commits/bd79688230ba11f5ed97e58cc78548de14b2c3db","created_at":"2020-05-27T21:48:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/634962921","html_url":"https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/422#issuecomment-634962921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/422","id":634962921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDk2MjkyMQ==","user":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
