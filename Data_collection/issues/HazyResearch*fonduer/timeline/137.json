your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI think a Fonduer-based app lifecycle has three phases: development, training, and serving.\r\nDuring development, you may have many iterations of re-definition of mention/candidate subclasses, labeling functions, which involve re-parsing, re-extraction, re-labeling, etc.\r\nI understand that it is important to persist intermediate results to a database to save time.\r\nDepending on the size of training dataset, you may need to persist intermediate results during training too.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no need to persist intermediate results to a database during inference/serving.\r\nThe dependency on database (postgres) makes a Fonduer-based app less portable and less scalable.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'd like no database dependency during inference/serving.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nsqlite is easier to install than postgres, but still there is no need to persist intermediate results to a database.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nRelated to
