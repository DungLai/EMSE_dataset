Thank you for letting us know the reason behind.\r\nThis behavior looked strange to me at first but now I can see it more clearly after reading documentations carefully.\r\nNonetheless, this behavior is still very confusing and would require improvement.\r\n\r\nHere is why this happens:\r\n`Featurizer` takes a list of candidate classes when it gets initialized.\r\n`featurizer.drop_keys` drops **only** keys that are associated with this list of candidate classes.\r\nMeanwhile `featurizer.get_keys()` returns a list of all keys that are stored in the database no matter which candidate class they are associated with.\r\n\r\nYour code should work as expected, but this `session.query(FeatureKey).delete(synchronize_session=\"fetch\")` should work too to clear the keys. It is a little hacky, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/comments/696961478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3795065553,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc5NTA2NTU1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3795065553","actor":{"login":"saikalyan9981","id":30959693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU5Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30959693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981","html_url":"https://github.com/saikalyan9981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-22T20:28:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3795065556,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3OTUwNjU1NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/events/3795065556","actor":{"login":"saikalyan9981","id":30959693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU5Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30959693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981","html_url":"https://github.com/saikalyan9981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saikalyan9981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-22T20:28:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T21:31:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T21:31:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/514","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/514/labels{/name}","comments_url"
