From my understanding, this can be any Context type (Sentence, Paragraph, etc.) but hasn't been implemented to do so. Is there another way to define this without manually editing the database?\r\n\r\nOn the same token, CandidateExtractor.apply() strictly generates TemporarySpans to represent candidates, which would disregard any changes to the Context type of any candidate_subclass arg. I also wonder if it's current possible to specify the Context that the CandidateExtractor considers to match the candidate model.\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong, please correct me, I am still attempting to understand the full workflow of this tool.\r\n\r\nEdit: I realize that Ngrams.apply() is the ultimate cause of the TemporarySpan issue, but I also realize an implementation that I overlooked would accomplish what I am looking for. Also discovered that the context type changes throughout method calls, one requiring a Document type while the next requires Sentences. If it's in the works to customize the Context type of a candidate model, this may need to be looked at as well.","closed_by":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
