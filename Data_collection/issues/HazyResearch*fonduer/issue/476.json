Please describe.**\r\n\r\nOne of my use cases is to extract information from scanned documents.\r\nTesseract, the most popular open-source OCR, supports hOCR as an output format.\r\nI'd like Fonduer to support hOCR (aka html OCR) as an input format.\r\n\r\n## Description of the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n1. I'd like Fonduer to use \"visual linker\" during pre-processing if needed (e.g., plain HTML is used).\r\n1. I'd like Fonduer to extract visual information embedded in HTML when parsing.\r\n\r\n## Description of the alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAccording to https://documents.icar-us.eu/documents/2016/12/report-on-file-formats-for-hand-written-text-recognition-htr-material.pdf, there are 4 major file formats for OCR:\r\n1. PAGE XML\r\n2. ALTO XML\r\n3. ABBYY FineReader XML\r\n4. hOCR\r\n\r\nThe first three formats are XML-based. On the other hand, hOCR is an XML-based format, but embedded in HTML/XHTML documents. Because of this characteristic, Fonduer can support hOCR by just extending the current `parser.py`.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI find it hard for beginners to understand the concept of \"visual linker\".\r\nFonduer uses four different modal information: textual, structural, tabular, and visual.\r\nThe first three modals are extracted from HTML files, but the visual modal comes from corresponding PDF files.\r\nI think this difference introduces a friction for beginners.\r\n\r\nWith this requested feature, Fonduer will assume that an HTML file contains all four modal information when parsing.\r\nThis would be easier to understand and would match what users would expect from the term \"parsing\".","closed_by":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/476/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
