The documents are parsed and the mentions and candidates are extracted with some rules.\r\n\r\nThe featurized training candidates are used to train a Fonduer Learning model and the model is used to predict on the test candidates, as per the normal fonduer pipeline as demonstrated in the hardware tutorial.\r\n\r\n**Problems & Questions**\r\n\r\n1. Is the fonduer prediction pipeline production ready? How can we fine tune it to achieve better accuracy? Should the main focus be on the quality of the extracted mentions? \r\n\r\nWith my initial analysis and usage following the hardware tutorial, I could not obtain good results.\r\n\r\n2.  Can we separate the training and test pipeline?\r\n\r\nAs in the current scenario, with a new document that I will feed for prediction, The entire corpus will have to be parsed to extract the mentions and candidates and store the feature keys. \r\n\r\nPlease correct me, if that won't be the case and help me with a snippet to showcase the separation.","closed_by":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
