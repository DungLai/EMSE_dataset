Use the latest commit (1d6771befb95f4ae94f308899633294a003dcfd6)\r\n2. Let a parser fail\r\n3. Execute `session.query(Document).count()` to see how many `Documents` are added to the database.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEither one of these behaviors\r\n1. The `Document` is not added.\r\n2. The error message gets corrected like \"Document is added but not parsed\".\r\n\r\n## Error Logs/Screenshots\r\n\r\n\"Document \"{document.name}\" not added to database, because of parse error\"\r\n\r\n## Environment (please complete the following information)\r\n - Fonduer Version: 0.8.3-dev (1d6771befb95f4ae94f308899633294a003dcfd6)\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nI think this is a regression caused by b1b8d24e1133e2229c5c02c6bdcf9eab36301a55, where `doc: Document` is saved to the database by `session.merge(doc, load=True)`, so this could happen on v0.8.0, v0.8.1, v0.8.2 too.","closed_by":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
