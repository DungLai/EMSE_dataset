the bug**\r\nWhen using a simple `LambdaFunctionMatcher`, I would expect the matcher to return all mentions for which the corresponding function returns `True`.\r\nHowever, `LambdaFunctionMatcher` as a subclass of `_NgramMatcher`/`_Matcher`, it has the `longest_match_only=True` attribute.\r\nThis can lead to cases where a sub-span, for witch the lambda function returns `True`, will *not* be added as a mention, if its parent span was already matched as `True` by the matcher.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAdd all spans to the returned mentions, if the lambda function returns `True`. This could be accomplished by setting `longest_match_only` to `False` by default. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
