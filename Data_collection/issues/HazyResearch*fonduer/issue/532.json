During the parsing phase, while most of them worked fine, one of the files can't be successfully parsed, in a way that no error message was printed, but the resulting database was empty.\r\n\r\nOne noticeable difference of this specific file is its size. The original sheet is a 700+ by 50+ table, the converted html file is 16MB, which are significant bigger than the others. After exploring for a while, I might suspect the parser doesn't handle large tables very well. By any chance do you have any experience on this type of issue? Thank you!\r\n\r\nP.S. As part of the inspection, I tripled the data volume (simple repetition of the rows for three time) of a smaller file to make the size comparable with the file of issue. Nothing was returned again, however, the parsing on the smaller file itself is good.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSince the data is confidential, I can't upload here. But I may be able to create some fake data if needed.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe `apply` method of `parser` failed when the original worksheet is bigger(?), without prompting error messages.\r\n\r\n## Error Logs/Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49058444/103314768-c7df5d00-49d8-11eb-83ee-8393a6d35de0.png)\r\n\r\n## Environment (please complete the following information)\r\n - PostgreSQL Version: 13.1\r\n - Fonduer Version: 0.8.2","closed_by":{"login":"linM24","id":49058444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDU4NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49058444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24","html_url":"https://github.com/linM24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linM24/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
