Visually displaying the candidates that are predicted as true is of great help, one can go through the document and quickly judge correct or mistaken instances.\r\n\r\nThe `visualizer` module is meant to assist with that, but I have encountered many problems with ImageMagick, mostly errors of type `CorruptImageError: unable to read image data` on `Image.resize()` .  This error occurs on some pages of my PDF documents, not all, but I can't detect a pattern or a cause. In general, I don't think that trying to visualize PDFs is the best strategy.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask whether an HTML visualizer is available, that highlights the span of each mention in the candidate. And if not available, why? Is there a good reason to prefer to transform PDFs into Images and then add candidates?\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
