Have a html with a figure object that doesn't have an image (eg. `<figure></figure>`)\r\n2. Run the `Parser` with a `HTMLDocPreprocessor` instance\r\n3. You will end up with the exception in `Parser.py (line 278 in apply)`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should exit the `_parse_figure` in case no figure was found\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 18.04] Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n - PostgreSQL Version: [e.g. 9.6] 10.12\r\n - Poppler Utils Version: [e.g. 0.62.0] 0.62.0-2\r\n - Fonduer Version: [e.g. 0.6.0] 0.8.3\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
