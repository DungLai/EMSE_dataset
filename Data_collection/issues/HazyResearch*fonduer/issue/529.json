I am using the latest release (v0.8.3), and the documentation for latest release tells that hOCR api is available (https://fonduer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/parser.html#fonduer.parser.preprocessors.HOCRDocPreprocessor). \r\n\r\nSo I think either I am missing something or the latest release don't have the hOCR functionality and api documentation is updated in advance. If thats the case then can you please tell me when the hOCR functionality is planned to be released?
