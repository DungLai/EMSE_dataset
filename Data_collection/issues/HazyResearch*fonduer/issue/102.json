example, this misses the case where the pdf_path is a file, but is HTML.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a user is using HTML as input, but has visual parsing enabled, they should get an error describing that PDFs are missing.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis could cause some users who are not using PDFs as input to get errors when doing a visual parse but not provide a useful error output to indicate that a PDF is missing.
