the bug**\r\nThe FAQs include one for handling \"fe_sendautho no password supplied\", which typically occurs on a machine where postgres was freshly installed.

If the Exception is caused by the fe_send_auth issue, the user should be directly pointed to the FAQ so they can fix it. If it is not the fe_send_auth issue, we can raise the more generic ValueError.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: e.g. Ubuntu 16.04\r\n - PostgreSQL Version: 11.1\r\n - Fonduer Version: 0.3.5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
