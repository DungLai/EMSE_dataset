I tried using the DocPreprocessor command but it looks like the parse_file function has not been built out yet. In the tutorial notebooks, it looks like both html files and pdf files are processed together, but I was wondering how I would go about parsing sentences for only pdf files. If there is some documentation I should be referring to, please let me know. Thanks.
