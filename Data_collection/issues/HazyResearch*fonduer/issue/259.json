Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI develop a Fonduer-based app locally on my laptop.\r\nOnce it's done, I'd like to package [the whole Fonduer pipeline](https://fonduer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/getting_started.html#the-fonduer-pipeline) (parsing, extraction, featurization, and classification) and deploy it to a remote place to serve.\r\nHowever, a Fonduer-based app is not easy to package hence not easy to deploy.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a Fonduer model class that is \r\n1. Serializable (e.g., a class with `save` and `load` member methods like below)\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass FonduerModel:\r\n    def save(path_to_save):\r\n    def load(path_to_load):\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Capable of executing any phase of the Fonduer pipeline\r\n3. (Hopefully) Manageable by MLflow\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI can create one or more of python scripts that do all the phase, package them, and deploy it.\r\nThis is cumbersome because the python script has to include many things (matchers, mention_classes, mention_spaces, candidate_classes, etc.) and it is not obvious what should be included for serving.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'd like to make Fonduer more deployable and servable.\r\nI've been testing MLflow to package a Fonduer-based app and found it was difficult to do so when there is no serializable Fonduer model.","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
