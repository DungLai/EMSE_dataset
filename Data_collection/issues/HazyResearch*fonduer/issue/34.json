now, snorkel uses some hacky global variables in [meta.py](https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/master/fonduer/snorkel/models/meta.py). This poses two main issues:\r\n\r\n1. It forces the user to set the `SNORKELDB` environment variable _before_ importing\r\n2. It is executing code on import alone. For example, just importing `fonduer` will create a `snorkel.db` file immediately. We should [say no to import side-effects](https://chrismorgan.info/blog/say-no-to-import-side-effects-in-python.html).\r\n\r\nPerhaps this should be some sort of Session class instead, with attributes that are accessed when needed, rather than using these global variables throughout the codebase.","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
