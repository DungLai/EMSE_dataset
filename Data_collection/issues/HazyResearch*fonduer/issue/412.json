Even more so if we have `parallelism=1` set in the Featurizer. However, we find that there can be small (e.g., < 5) differences between feature tables, resulting in slightly different sparse matrices, and thus, slightly different results.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRunning on the HACK transistor dataset will reproduce the error. However, it will take a long time, and we haven't been able to get a very minimal example that reproduces the error yet. Attached are two feature table dumps between two different runs with `parallelism=1`. Note that there is only a single difference on line `65454`.\r\n\r\n[feature_table.tar.gz](https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/files/4589655/feature_table.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nNote that it isn't always one difference, and the difference is not deterministic. The different attached is just an example.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe would expect that these feature tables are identical between runs.\r\n\r\n**Error Logs/Screenshots**\r\nFor convenience, here is the differing line in screenshot form\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7573542/81232657-1e131200-8faa-11ea-9d84-8a735b693166.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf the issue is in the UDF implementation, this might affect the Labeler in addition to the Featurizer, since they share a lot of the UDF code.","closed_by":{"login":"senwu","id":5580008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODAwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5580008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu","html_url":"https://github.com/senwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
