Modify the if-statement in the following\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/bfea88adf474d0cd77f4fd11b7227301b6f3f529/src/fonduer/features/feature_libs/textual_features.py#L44-L47\r\n\r\nto `if True:`\r\n\r\n2. Run `pytest tests/features/test_features.py`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen all the child processes fail, the parent process should finish and fail.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nsnorkel-extraction monitors the number of live child processes, but does not specify `timeout` parameter during `out_queue.get()`.\r\nhttps://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-extraction/blob/ce9551bd47f1f0a8e52fa88c155e3bb43f636b8b/snorkel/udf.py#L112","closed_by":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
