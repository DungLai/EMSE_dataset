This falls outside of the domain of the edge case of sentences being next to the edge of a page or spanning over different pages; even in the middle of a page, two words that are aligned horizontally may end up having drastically different tops.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be mostly the case with top and bottom properties, or at least it is more reasonably easy to find out the discrepancies there.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Preprocess any document\r\n- Query the Sentences in the Document, and save a slice of about 20 or so\r\n- For each Sentence, print sentence.top and compare the values to the document\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\"visit.\" was in a Document I parsed, for which sentence.bottom yielded [292, 154] and sentence.top yielded [282, 144]. It is clear they are visibly aligned on the bottom, instead of 138 pixels apart as the visual data suggests.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nFor the example, we would expect sentence.bottom to yield almost identical values. As for the rest of the data, it seems very inconsistent. Some sentences offer a very accurate representation of each word's position, some suggest that words are spread hundreds of pixels apart when they are aligned.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n - PostgreSQL Version: 9.5.14\r\n - Fonduer Version: 0.3.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
