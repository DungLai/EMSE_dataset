Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf you use HTML files as the primary source, you would print them as PDF files in a pre-preprocessing.\r\nYou would use `HTMLDocPreprocessor`, and `Parser` with `visual=True` and `pdf_path` args, which activates the visual linker that links a HTML file and the corresponding PDF file to get the visual information.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you start from CSV, TSV, or Text files, you would not use `VisualLinker` (ie `Parser` with `visual=False` and `pdf_path=None` args).\r\n\r\nIf you start from PDFs, you would use `pdftotext` to extract the text layer or apply OCR to them when they have no text layer. In either case, you would get HTML files with textual and visual information. However, the current implementation of Fonduer cannot use the visual information embedded in HTML files.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. Separate VisualLinker from `Parser` and make it as a helper tool, and remove `pdf_path` arg from `Parser`\r\n2. Change the meaning of `visual=True` from activating the visual linker to extracting the visual information embedded in HTML files (or any type of primary source files).\r\n\r\nThe helper tool takes a HTML file and the corresponding PDF file, runs the visual linker, embeds the visual information to the input HTML file, and returns it.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nThe visuallinker could be migrated to `HTMLDocPreprocessor`, but I'd suggest to make it a complete separate helper tool to make the Fonduer pipeline (starting from docpreprocessor) simpler.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe current meaning of `visual=True` is different from other modals like `lingual=True`: the former means activating the visual linker, while the latter means extracting something embedded in the source files, which is confusing.\r\n\r\nOnce the solution I described above is implemented, `visual=True`, `lingual=True`, `tabular=True` all mean extracting the corresponding modal information from the (primary) source files.","closed_by":{"login":"HiromuHota","id":20668349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjY4MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20668349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota","html_url":"https://github.com/HiromuHota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiromuHota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
