No exception or warning is generated. \r\n**Hangs aren't easily reproducible**: UDF will hang on a file for one run, then after a full reset UDF will parse that file without a problem, only to hang on some other file.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nUsing very similar code to what's found in the fonduer-tutorials max_storage_temp_tuturial, run the parser UDF on a set of less-trivial PDFs (multiple pages).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nInformative / actionable error reporting so the developer can take further action to diagnose the problem. \r\nDecoupling operations from postgresql and moving towards in-memory operations as mentioned in #137 might address this concern.\r\n\r\n## Error Logs/Screenshots\r\nN/A, only a frozen progress bar.\r\n\r\n## Environment (please complete the following information)\r\n - OS: MacOS 10.15\r\n - PostgreSQL Version: 12.1\r\n - Poppler Utils Version: 0.71.0-5\r\n - Fonduer Version: 0.8.3\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nI'm using the jupyter/postgres docker containers provided for fonduer-tutorials.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"robbieculkin","id":20375994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzc1OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20375994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin","html_url":"https://github.com/robbieculkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbieculkin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
