your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI noticed that `Ngrams` objects have a `split_tokens` argument that is by default set to `(\"-\",\"/\")`.\r\n(https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer/blob/master/src/fonduer/candidates/mentions.py)\r\nAdditionally, this separation is exclusively applied to split a single mention into two mentions, only for the first occurrence of such character.\r\nThis implementation seems to be made in reference to some quite specific use-case and there might be more fitting default behaviors of `Ngrams`.\r\n \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSet a more generic default, e.g.:\r\n 1. List of default separators initialized as `[]`\r\n 2. Apply splitting to all occurrences of the specified split characters, for all mention ngrams\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukehsiao","id":7573542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7573542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehsiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehsiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
