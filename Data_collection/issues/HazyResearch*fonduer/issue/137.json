Please describe.**\r\nDecouple `UDF` processes from the backend/database session. \r\nRight now, when we run `UDFRunner.apply_mt()`, we create a number of `UDF` worker processes. These processes all own an sqlalchemy `Session` object and add/commit to the database at the end of their respective parsing loop.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMake the UDF processes backend-agnostic, e.g. by having a set of separate `BackendWorker` processes handle the insertion of sentences. One possible way: Connect the output_queue of `UDF` to the input of `BackendWorker`, which receive `Sentence` lists and handle the sqlalchemy commits.\r\n\r\nThis will not fully decouple `UDF` from the backend, because the parser returns sqlalchemy-specific `Sentence` objects, but it could be one step towards that goal.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis feature request refers to decoupling of *parsing* and backend.\r\nThere's likely more coupling with the backend later in the processing pipeline.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/137/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
