Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe method signature is currently `RegexMatchSpan(rgx: str, ignore_case: bool, search: bool=False, full_match: bool=True, longest_match_only: bool)`.\r\n\r\n`search=False` is equivalent to wrap the provided `rgx` with `^(<rgx>)` to match at the beginning of a span.\r\nOn the other hand, `full_match=True` wraps the provided `rgx` with `(<rgx>)$` to match at the end of a span.\r\nThe problem is that `full_match=True` fully matches only when `search=False`, which means the behavior of `full_match` depends on `search`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nRemove `search` and `full_match` args, and add a new arg like `mode` that takes \"search\", \"match\", or \"fullmatch\" (named after `re.search`, `re.match`, `re.fullmatch`).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nJust remove `search` and `full_match` args and give the user the full control over regex.\r\nIn this case, the `ignore_case` can also be removed.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
