I have only gone through it a little bit but am quite excited to explore its full capabilities.  \r\n\r\nI am going through the transistor_image_tutorial at the moment. Running the lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncorpus_parser = Parser(structural=True, lingual=True, visual=True, pdf_path=pdf_path, flatten=[])\r\n%time corpus_parser.apply(doc_preprocessor, parallelism=PARALLEL)\r\n```\r\nI get the following UnicodeEncodeError. \r\n\r\n![transistor_image_tutorial - unicodeencodeerror](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35154803/43555578-05f25406-95c9-11e8-886d-d9b4a7dc049c.PNG)\r\n\r\nAs a result, when I execute the next line, I get \r\n\r\nDocuments: 0\r\nSentences: 0\r\nFigures: 0\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is a workaround for this or if I needed to do something first to avoid the error and get the same result as the original transistor_image_tutorial file.
