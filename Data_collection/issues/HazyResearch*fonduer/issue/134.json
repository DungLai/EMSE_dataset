Please describe.**\r\nAt the moment we use `HtmlDocPreprocessor` to separately generate pre-processed documents that are fed into the parser.\r\n\r\nIf we want to extract visual features, we currently need corresponding pdf files for each input document. Fetching the pdf file path currently happens inside parser, which is initialized with a `pdf_path` argument. This couples the parser with input data generation. Furthermore, we can only test whether a matching pdf file exists, when the ParserUDF.apply() method is called, because we have no knowledge about the html input files before.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHave a (separate) generator that handles generation and checking of the matching pdf file paths, which are fed into the `parser.apply()` method, e.g. `parser.apply((doc,text), pdf_path, **kwargs)`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nExtend HtmlDocPreprocessor to return tuples of three values (doc,text,pdf_path), if a `visual_linking_pdf_path` is provided.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOne thing to consider is that there are also other ways of visual linking that would not require PDF files in the future.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/134/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HazyResearch/fonduer/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
