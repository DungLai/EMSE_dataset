The main reasons for this are:\r\n- To remain compatible with new releases of TF and Keras (the official version of which is now `tf.keras`) and make use of bug fixes, etc. some regression issues. As we have found (#42, #43), installing with newer versions of either package break installation and usage.\r\n- To address multiple vulnerabilities contained in `tensorflow < 1.15.2`.\r\n- To simplify the installation process; since TF 2.x now includes support for both CPU and GPU, we can now directly include tensorflow in the project dependencies, (as brought up in #39).\r\n\r\nA priori, it seems like the main things to do are:\r\n- Updating the dependencies in `setup.py` to include tensorflow\r\n- Modifying the model definitions to be `tf.keras` compatible\r\n- Porting the model files to a format that can be loaded by `tf.keras` with TF 2.x\r\n\r\nThe main concern that comes to mind is the regression tests. We have already seen that `tensorflow > 1.13` causes regression tests to fail. I imagine that this will only worsen as we introduce not only a new major release to TF, but also a divergence in Keras with `tf.keras`. @justinsalamon, what are your thoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"auroracramer","id":1388668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer","html_url":"https://github.com/auroracramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
