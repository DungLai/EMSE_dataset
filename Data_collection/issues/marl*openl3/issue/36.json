Assuming that a delay by 1 analysis window size (1 second) is acceptable. Is this use-case something you aim to support with OpenL3, and maybe have tested? If so it would be great to have an example or documentation for it.\r\n\r\nLooking briefly at the API docs and source code, it seems this could be possible by combining.\r\n`model = load_embedding_model(...)` with `get_embeddings(chunk, sr, model=model, ...`), where `chunk` is the just-received 1 second of audio. Any caveats?\r\n\r\nAlso, any estimates on what the hardware requirements would be to reach real-time performance?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
