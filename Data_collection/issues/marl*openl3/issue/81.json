It seems that you should leave it as a float, and round every time you use it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want embeddings every 25ms and have 44100Hz audio, then the sample hop length is 1102.5. In this\r\nexample, you will drift 25ms every 37 minutes of audio. This is just an example because the sample rate is 48000 here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/81/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/81/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
