If so do we save it in the same file?\r\n- What format should we use?\r\n    - h5: Nice compression options, but since these typically shouldn't be large, it might be more annoying to deal with than other options\r\n    - npy/npz: Standard approach, can easily load numpy arrays directly\r\n    - JAMS: Using JAMs would help expand its use and would have a natural way to associate the timestamps with each embedding, but storing all of the values as text might be cumbersome and make the files big, especially if they are long\r\n- Should we use the embedding type to name the embedding? e.g. `example_audio_openl3_6144emb_linear_music.<ext>` Or should we just keep it simple?\r\n    - It might be good if the user is comparing different embeddings, but it might be cumbersome if people just want to use a single type of embeddings. Of course we could add an option for this, but adding another option for something like this might be excessive.","closed_by":{"login":"auroracramer","id":1388668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer","html_url":"https://github.com/auroracramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
