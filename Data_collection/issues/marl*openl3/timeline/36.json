If you plan to use non-overlapping windows (i.e. just 1 prediction per second) it should be totally doable - I have a real-time demo running a similarly sized CNN (albeit in... wait for it... lasagne!) which runs happily on a macbook pro with CPU processing (no GPU required). With a GPU you'll be laughing. Just have to get the multiprocessing right to separate audio buffering, prediction, and UI updates into separate processes.\r\n\r\nClosing this out as this isn't actually an issue, but feel free to re-open if you encounter any specific problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/comments/570960543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2922774627,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyMjc3NDYyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/events/2922774627","actor":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-05T23:43:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
