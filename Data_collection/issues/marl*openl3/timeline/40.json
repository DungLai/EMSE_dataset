just installed openl3 intro a fresh conda environment (python 3.6) via `pip install openl3` and I was able to call `emb, ts = openl3.get_audio_embedding(audio, sr)` without any errors.\r\n\r\nHow did you install the repo? If you installed it from source (rather than via pip), note that the model files are stored on GH in a compressed format (.gz) and need to be uncompressed before they can be used (the pip installation takes care of this). Without further information, I'd guess your problem is related to this issue.\r\n\r\nInstalling via pip should fix your problem. If you need to install from source, make sure to uncompress the model files manually. The error you pasted is about not finding the model file on your file system, not about not being able to download it from GH. I'm guessing you have the files locally as .gz while the code is looking for the uncompressed .h5 file.\r\n\r\nIf you try the two suggestions above and are still experiencing issues please describe your system (OS, python environment etc.) and the exact process you followed to install openl3.\r\n\r\nIf the above suggestions fix your issue, please let us know so we can close this issue out.
