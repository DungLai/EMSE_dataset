using class attributes set before building. \r\n\r\nI left the old methods in btw and just used them to wrap the newer API.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n - you can extend the `OpenL3LinearAudioModel`, `OpenL3Mel128AudioModel`, and `OpenL3Mel256AudioModel` classes to change model parameters\r\n - the final pooling size is now calculated from the final output layer size and the requested embedding size, meaning that other embedding sizes are possible assuming that `embedding_size / n_filter_4` has integer factors and that the factors can divide evenly into the output shape of the final layer. \r\n\r\nSome things that I have yet to do:\r\n - Add docs\r\n - Add specific tests besides what was already in place\r\n - Add constraints to which parameters can be
