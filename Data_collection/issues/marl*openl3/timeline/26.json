updated the proposed API changes in #19. Regarding batch processing if we wanted to not add too many functions, then we could do this:\r\n\r\nFor `get_audio_embedding`, batch mode would be used if `audio` is a non-`np.ndarray` iterable. `sr` could be an iterable also of the same length as `audio` if there is variable sample rates. There would have to be a check to make sure that if `sr` is iterable, it matches `audio` in length (and `audio` must also be a non-`np.ndarray` iterable). We could also add a `batch_size` argument to control how big the batches are (and how much is loaded in memory at once).\r\n\r\nFor `get_vframe_embedding`, a similar approach would be taken where `image_arr` as a non-`np.npdarray` iterable would result in batch processing. Similarly, `frame_rate` could be an iterable of the same length as `image_arr` (if all of the items of the batch are videos). Again, we could also add a `batch_size` argument to control how big the batches are (and how much is loaded in memory at once).\r\n\r\nFor `process_audio_file`, `process_vframe_file` and `process_video_file`, if filepath is a non-`six.string_type` iterable, then we can run in batch mode. We would also add a batch mode here. Though for batch mode we'd have to do some extra stuff outside of the loop to make most efficient use of batching without loading all of the files in at once.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/comments/503683881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"auroracramer","id":1388668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer","html_url":"https://github.com/auroracramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/comments/504147378","html_url":"https://github.com/marl/openl3/issues/26#issuecomment-504147378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/26","id":504147378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDE0NzM3OA==","user":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T19:11:27Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T19:11:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sounds reasonable I guess?
