we've done is the following:\r\n* Update Kapre (lets call it v2) and try to match the old version (v1) as closely as possible\r\n* Implement a librosa front-end and try to match it as closely as possible to v1 as well\r\n* Compare the embeddings\r\n* Compare performance on downstream classification of the UrbanSound8K dataset\r\n\r\nAs you might expect, the embeddings don't match perfectly when we replace the audio front-end. However, performance on the downstream classification task was the same (or within the margin of error), which we hope is good enough.\r\n\r\nSo, the updated version of OpenL3 will let you choose between the Kapre and Librosa front-end, but they are not interchangeable. Models trained on embeddings from a specific front-end should continue to use the same front-end for inference. The same would apply if we incorporated a pytorch version - it would be close but probably not interchangeable with the TF versions.\r\n\r\nYes, I owe you an email.
