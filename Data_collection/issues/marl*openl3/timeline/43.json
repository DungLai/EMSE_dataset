some point in the somewhat near future, we should establish support for TF 2.x and `tf.keras`. The main reasons for this are:\r\n- To remain compatible with new releases of TF and Keras (the official version of which is now `tf.keras`) and make use of bug fixes, etc. some regression issues. As we have found (#42, #43), installing with newer versions of either package break installation and usage.\r\n- To address multiple vulnerabilities contained in `tensorflow < 1.15.2`.\r\n- To simplify the installation process; since TF 2.x now includes support for both CPU and GPU, we can now directly include tensorflow in the project dependencies, (as brought up in #39).\r\n\r\nA priori, it seems like the main things to do are:\r\n- Updating the dependencies in `setup.py` to include tensorflow\r\n- Modifying the model definitions to be `tf.keras` compatible\r\n- Porting the model files to a format that can be loaded by `tf.keras` with TF 2.x\r\n\r\nThe main concern that comes to mind is the regression tests. We have already seen that `tensorflow > 1.13` causes regression tests to fail. I imagine that this will only worsen as we introduce not only a new major release to TF, but also a divergence in Keras with `tf.keras`. @justinsalamon, what are your thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
