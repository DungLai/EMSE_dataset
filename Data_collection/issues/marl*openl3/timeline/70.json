You can use `--branch <branch-name> --single-branch` when cloning to only clone master. We can add it to the README for now.\r\n\r\nLonger term, I'm not sure where the best place to move it is. Hosting model files on GitHub is already kind of messy and frowned upon (and is limited to 100MB), though since the weight files aren't too big, maybe it's fine moving it to another repo? As far as other platforms, hosting on Google Drive seems risky as far as access and ownership. IIRC I've seen Zenodo used for model releases, maybe that could work?\r\n\r\nEither way, moving the models would break all of the previous versions, so maybe we could do another symlink-like hack to redirect to the new location. \r\n\r\nidk what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/comments/894431083/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"auroracramer","id":1388668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer","html_url":"https://github.com/auroracramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auroracramer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
