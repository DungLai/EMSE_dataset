If your audio file is longer, multiple frames will be extracted using a 1-second sliding window with a 0.1 second hop size by default (as per the [tutorial](https://openl3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)). You can change the hop size if you want. \r\n\r\nFor a 5 second audio file this means you'll get back (if you don't change any of the parameters) an array with 46 embedding frames (by default we zero-pad beginning of the signal so that the first frame is centered on time 0). In addition to the embedding array the API also returns a timestamp array which stores the timestamp corresponding to each embedding frame.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/comments/488532552/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2313389306,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMxMzM4OTMwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marl/openl3/issues/events/2313389306","actor":{"login":"justinsalamon","id":3009670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3009670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon","html_url":"https://github.com/justinsalamon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinsalamon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-02T01:54:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
