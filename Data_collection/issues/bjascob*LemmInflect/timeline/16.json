Using `getAllLemmasOOV()` requires a `upos` type, so this function would need to be repeatedly called for all possible lemmatizing values (NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV)\r\n3. In addition, `getAllLemmasOOV()` may return poorly formed words when trying to lemmatize using the wrong `upos` type. This means the function would likely inject a number of clearly incorrect words when the original word may simply have been misspelled.\r\n\r\nDue to the possibility of completely incorrect words when using OOV rules, it's probably best not to use that function at all when we don't know the `upos`.\r\n\r\nFor those that wish the ability to lemmatize without knowing the `upos`, it's easy enough for them to call `getAllLemmas()` and then filter the returned dictionary based on the specifc logic they wish to apply. \r\n\r\nGiven that there is already a simple function for the reasonable case of dictionary only look-up, I won't implement a new function here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/comments/1374993730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjascob","id":22728060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzI4MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22728060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob","html_url":"https://github.com/bjascob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8177527538,"node_id":"CE_lADOCxjdis5VcFcGzwAAAAHnayry","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/events/8177527538","actor":{"login":"bjascob","id":22728060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzI4MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22728060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob","html_url":"https://github.com/bjascob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-09T01:15:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
