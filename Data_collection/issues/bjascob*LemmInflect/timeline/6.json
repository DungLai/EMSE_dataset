However, I'm a little concerned that there might be instances where it only has the base form and falling back to the OOV rules for inflection allow things to work correctly for the user.\r\n\r\nThe right way to do this would be to have a defined list or set of rules for these exceptions and implement a lookup for them.  I can look in the base NIH lexicon to see if there's anything that would with that.  If you're aware of any resource that details this behavior, let me know.  I'll have to look into this some more.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/comments/695240407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjascob","id":22728060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzI4MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22728060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob","html_url":"https://github.com/bjascob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3785210251,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3ODUyMTAyNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/events/3785210251","actor":{"login":"bjascob","id":22728060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzI4MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22728060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob","html_url":"https://github.com/bjascob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-19T15:09:00Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
