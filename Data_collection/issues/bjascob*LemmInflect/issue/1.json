To prevent this consider...\r\n* Add hard-coded rules to choose the next best if the rule doesn't apply\r\n* Split the model into 3 parts (verb, noun, adj/adv) and run separately\r\n* Add contra-cases to training data so it learns not to do this\r\n\r\nIn addition, the model classes include the ending letters to remove.  However, similar above, there is nothing to prevent it selecting a \"remove ing\" rule for a word ending in something else.  I'm not aware of this causing issues but it should be investigated when looking into the first issue.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
