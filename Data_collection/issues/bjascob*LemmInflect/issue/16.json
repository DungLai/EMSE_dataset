This is problematic for words like \"painting\" which could either be \"paint\" for a verb or \"painting\" for a noun.  Regardless, it may be useful to simply return \"paint\" for use in Neural Network sentence classification, etc..\r\n\r\nProposed approach is to use the dictionary to find the shortest word. If the word is not in the dictionary then try OOV for Nouns and Verbs and choose the shortest.","closed_by":{"login":"bjascob","id":22728060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzI4MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22728060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob","html_url":"https://github.com/bjascob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjascob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bjascob/LemmInflect/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
