@usamabaig1 So there are two concepts here, first is the grid size, e.g. 768, the other is the patch size within the grid, e.g. 256. Each patch within the grid is modeled through CNN and CRF. We obtained the tumor/normal label of each patch within the grid by checking the center coordinate of each patch with respect to the ground truth annotation mask. Therefore, for a grid size of 768 of 3x3 256 patches, the label will also be 3x3 of 1/0. If you just want to randomly sample tumor or normal coordinates, the code is pretty much already there by using the tissue mask code as noted in #14 . But the performance won't be great without hard negative mining. However the code for hard negative mining is quite a bit painful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/463047118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yil8","id":1263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8","html_url":"https://github.com/yil8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2135613938,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzNTYxMzkzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2135613938","actor":{"login":"SamitHuang","id":8156835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTY4MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8156835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/SamitHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T03:53:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2135613939,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzU2MTM5Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2135613939","actor":{"login":"SamitHuang","id":8156835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTY4MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8156835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/SamitHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamitHuang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T03:53:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2135613944,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzNTYxMzk0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2135613944","actor":{"login":"usamabaig1","id":36220048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjIwMDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36220048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1","html_url":"https://github.com/usamabaig1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usamabaig1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-13T03:53:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2135613945,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzU2MTM5NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2135613945","actor":{"login":"usamabaig1","id":36220048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjIwMD
