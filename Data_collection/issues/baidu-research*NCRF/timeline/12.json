I actually feel what you got is already roughly the same as mine. First, I did not have any tricks for preprocessing/postprocessing. Everything is within the codebase. There are some important details when you try to sample the coordinates for training patches, but since I've already provided my sampled coordinates, it doesn't matter anyway. As for testing reproducibility, have you tried to use the [ckpt](https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF/blob/master/ckpt/resnet18_crf.ckpt) I provided within the codebase to generate the probability map before you trained your own? If you use my ckpt, you should be able to get a probability map of Test_001.tif as this:\r\n<img width=\"677\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-07-23 at 11 12 26 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1263739/43095330-565c3c1a-8e6a-11e8-8f70-066dc2fadb72.png\">\r\nI would highly recommend using `cmap=jet` to plot the probability map as compared to black/white in your case, which does not quite differentiate numbers around 0.5\r\n``` python\r\nIn [1]: import numpy as np\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nIn [3]: probs_map = np.load('./Test_001.npy')\r\n\r\nIn [4]: plt.imshow(probs_map.transpose(), vmin=0, vmax=1, cmap='jet')\r\nOut[4]: <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x7f35e994ca58>\r\n\r\nIn [5]: plt.show()\r\n```\r\nAnd I would subjectively argue this figure matches the ground truth annotation pretty well. If you could reproduce this probability map and the corresponding FROC score of ~0.8 (as already achieved by one user), then at least there should be no problems in the postprocessing steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/407155773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yil8","id":1263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8","html_url":"https://github.com/yil8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1748411003,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc0ODQxMTAwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1748411003","actor":{"login":"yux94","id":27813052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODEzMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27813052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94","html_url":"https://github.com/yux94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T18:27:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1748411005,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NDg0MTEwMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1748411005","actor":{"login":"yux94","id":27813052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODEzMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27813052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94","html_url":"https://github.com/yux94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T18:27:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/407257838","html_url":"https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12#issuecomment-407257838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12","id":407257838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzI1NzgzOA==","user":{"login":"yux94","id":27813052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODEzMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27813052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94","html_url":"https://github.com/yux94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-24T02:14:03Z","updated_at":"2018-07-24T02:14:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank

said that one user have already achieved good performance. And I am working on retraining the network again. Besides, it would be very nice if you could provide the detailed process of your sampling with hard mining.

Your last heatmap plot based on my ckpt also looks good, and I guess if you calculate the FROC score, it probably will be around 0.8 as well. For the training part, again due to non-determinism of GPU convolution, it's almost impossible to achieve numerical identical results for retraining. But I would still suggest you plot your training curve, so that I can get some rough ideas. I'm currently traveling for business trip, and will try to find some time to implement the hard-negative sampling part once I'm back to
