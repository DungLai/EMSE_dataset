Usually it includes two steps. The first step is easier, it starts with obtaining the tissue mask of each tumor slide. Then I randomly sample coordinates based on the tumor tissue mask and determine it's label based on the annotation. But only random sampling is not good enough, you have to include hard negative patches, and the second step is for this purpose. But the code for this hard negative mining part is messy, and it involves training a first model, obtain false tumor regions with high probability, and save them as coordinates. I'll see if there are many people demanding this functionality, I'll spare some time implement it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/408182775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yil8","id":1263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8","html_url":"https://github.com/yil8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1755661424,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc1NTY2MTQyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1755661424","actor":{"login":"LXYTSOS","id":8330006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzAwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8330006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS","html_url":"https://github.com/LXYTSOS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-26T17:59:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1755661426,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NTU2NjE0MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1755661426","actor":{"login":"LXYTSOS","id":8330006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzAwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8330006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS","html_url":"https://github.com/LXYTSOS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXYTSOS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-26T17:59:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"yux94","id":27813052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODEzMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27813052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94","html_url":"https://github.com/yux94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yux94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-27T07:24:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T07:24:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/12","id":343479927,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDM0Nzk5Mjc=","number":12,"title":"Some
