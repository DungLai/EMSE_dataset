Since we were doing binary classification, 1-d logit was used, where > 0 means tumor and < 0 means normal, and binary cross entropy loss was used. If you want to go multi-class, I guess you have to use N-d logits, where N is the number of classes, and softmax has to be used for the loss. I haven't thought about the details yet, but I think if should be minor modification on top of the current implementation, mostly on the expectation and normalization part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/407144768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yil8","id":1263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8","html_url":"https://github.com/yil8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1748336489,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc0ODMzNjQ4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1748336489","actor":{"login":"BeHappy1","id":26538531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM4NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26538531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1","html_url":"https://github.com/BeHappy1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T17:52:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1748336491,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NDgzMzY0OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/1748336491","actor":{"login":"BeHappy1","id":26538531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM4NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26538531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1","html_url":"https://github.com/BeHappy1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T17:52:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/407728370","html_url":"https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/13#issuecomment-407728370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/13","id":407728370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzcyODM3MA==","user":{"login":"BeHappy1","id":26538531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM4NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26538531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1","html_url":"https://github.com/BeHappy1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeHappy1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-25T11:54:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T11:54:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks

layer时，对这个公式\"probs * pairwise_potential - (1 - probs) * pairwise_potential\"有一点不理解，（通过 #13 已经知道在代码里有详细介绍，同时在看代码的时候也注意到了）\r\n这个是不是用的这个公式来的，我看是期望，期望的话，是不是\r\n![expectation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57225932/129444223-b691d58a-08f7-46eb-b197-cd8842e97950.png)\r\nprobs 是i 为tumor的概率，pairwise_potential 对应的是W的相似性的一个新的值，就像如果向量很相似，那角度就是0，对应的值就是cos 就是1，那他们的w就是一样的，如果角度是180那就是完全相反情况，那值w就是相反的为-1*w，所以在  1. i=T,j=T; 2. i=N,j=T; 3. i=T,j=N; 4. i=N,j=N\r\n 的四种情况的第一种和第四种，就是数据+pairwise_potential出现的概率为probs，所以case1 是‘probs * +pairwise_potential’，同理第四个就是 i 为normal,那其概率就是 1-probs, 事件 是相反的， 所以就是 -pairwise_potential，所以case 4 是 ‘(1 - probs) * -pairwise_potential‘ . \r\n![pair](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57225932/129444724-4d0d9241-17a7-4b88-a5f8-f18263bd2600.png)\r\n事件乘以概率，得到期望，然后23是根据’label
