Thanks for your suggestion. By default, we I have to first generate a tissue mask before obtaining the probability heat map. And this generated tissue mask is supposed to be at higher level, e.g. level 6 by default, and therefore its size should be much smaller than the size of the raw WSI at level 0. After obtaining the tissue mask, the probability heat map is then computed based on that. I did not remember run into issues of level_dimensions have inconsistent ratios, therefore I was curious which test slide has this
