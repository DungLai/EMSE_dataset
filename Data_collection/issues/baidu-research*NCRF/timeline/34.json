Then you know if you may have bugs either in the CNN part or the CRF part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/488176730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yil8","id":1263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8","html_url":"https://github.com/yil8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yil8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2311163804,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxMTE2MzgwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2311163804","actor":{"login":"OpenCv30","id":13656983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU2OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13656983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenCv30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-01T02:18:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2311163805,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTExNjM4MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/events/2311163805","actor":{"login":"OpenCv30","id":13656983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU2OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13656983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenCv30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-01T02:18:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/comments/489513069","html_url":"https://github.com/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/34#issuecomment-489513069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baidu-research/NCRF/issues/34","id":489513069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTUxMzA2OQ==","user":{"login":"OpenCv30","id":13656983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU2OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13656983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenCv30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenCv30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T06:30:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T06:33:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yil8 -
