Datasets about crack are really hard to find. But i've found out that some crack mask in dataset are much more wider than the real crack, let's take Volker_DSC01704_219_142_1156_1117.jpg in this dataset as example, crack width in the mask is about 10 pixels, while the real crack width is about 2 or 3 pixel width. \r\n        Is crack label width 3 times larger than the crack 's real width? I think mismatch crack width would effect the segmentation model' s performance, as the BCE loss would take crack pixel gray value into account, and i don't know how to generate accurate crack pixel width based on these wider masks\r\n       Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!
