Thanks a lot for your contribution to the open-sourced community!  \r\n\r\nBy the way,  would you mind adding a license such as MIT license to your github repository? This kind of license will confirm the open sourced usage of this repo and perhaps more people will use it without any license problem. \r\n\r\nIâ€™m looking forward to your reply and thanks by advance. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nxcqiutim\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/khanhha/crack_segmentation/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/khanhha/crack_segmentation/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
