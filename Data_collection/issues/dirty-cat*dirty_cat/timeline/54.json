PR aims at implementing an \"automatic column vectorizer\" as suggested by #54 (solves #54) : the SuperVectorizer.\r\n\r\nIt can be used to automatically apply encoders to columns, depending on implicit characteristic (such as the column `dtype`).\r\nUnder the hood, it is an interface for sklearn's `ColumnTransformer`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it selects columns based on their `dtype`, and divides them into several groups:\r\n- Numerical variables\r\n- Datetime variables\r\n- Low cardinality categorical variables\r\n- High cardinality categorical variables\r\n- Low cardinality string variables\r\n- High cardinality string variables\r\n\r\nAs you noticed, we differentiate categorical and string.  \r\nThe threshold used to categorize low or high cardinality can be specified by the user.\r\n\r\nAn experimental feature currently implemented is the `auto_cast`, which will try to cast each column to the best possible data type.\r\n\r\nPlease submit feedback and suggestions, I'd be happy to discuss it
