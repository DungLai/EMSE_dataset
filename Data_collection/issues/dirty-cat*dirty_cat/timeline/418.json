Add the possibility for the benchmark function to return a dictionnary, which is added to the results by the `monitor` decorator\r\n• Benchmark different encoders for fuzzy_join (issue #418, related to #420) . It seems that using the `HashingVectorizer` instead of `CountVectorizer` is always better (no cost for f1 score, and almost always faster, see plot). If the user want to tradeoff performance for speed, it seems better to play with the `ngram_range` than changing the encoder. Therefore I recommend to just use the `HashingVectorizer` for `fuzzy_join`, instead of using it only for big datasets like in #420.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing what other people think!\r\n<img width=\"1384\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45738728/209351202-43126bc1-72c9-46b7-ad41-5fe14e67acb4.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8236346539,"node_id":"CE_lADOB3LOgs5YBcUgzwAAAAHq7Kyr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/events/8236346539","actor":{"login":"jovan-stojanovic","id":62058944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDU4OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62058944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/jovan-stojanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-16T14:06:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
