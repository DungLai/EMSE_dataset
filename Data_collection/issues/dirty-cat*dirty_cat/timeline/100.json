That's a good remark.\r\n\r\nThere is a link to string kernels, but it's not as trivial as doing an expansion of a string kernel, because similarity encoding takes in account the \"shape\" of the categories. The correspond kernel does not boil down to a string kernel. If you look at the paper (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01806175), equation 12 gives the expression of the kernel: \r\n```\r\n<d_i , d_j>_sim = 𝚺_l sim(d_i , d_l ) sim(d_j , d_l )\r\n```\r\nWhere \"sim\" is the similarity used by the similarity encoding, d_i and d_j are two instances, and the sum goes over the reference categories.\r\n\r\nRather than a Nystrom expansion of the kernel, this is an expansion over prototypes, without whitening. Basically, it captures the \"covariance\" of the strings in the training set.\r\n\r\nHowever, you have a good intuition that following this lead can help understanding what similarity encoding is doing. We have been doing this lately, and this has enabled us to come up with a very different formulation that is faster in the sens that it does not have to compute costly string similarities, to sum over a large number of prototypes, and that it can be implemented online. We're submitting this to KDD in a week, and the code will follow online soon.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, validating these things is a lot of work (and the new submission will have twice as many datasets!).\r\n\r\nHappy to keep you posted, and maybe to discuss this IRL.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/comments/458569687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GaelVaroquaux","id":208217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODIxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux","html_url":"https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/comments/458586793","html_url":"https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/100#issuecomment-458586793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/100","id":458586793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODU4Njc5Mw==","user":{"login":"amueller","id":449558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller","html_url":"https://github.com/amueller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amueller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T15:38:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T15:38:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
