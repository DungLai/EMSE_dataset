pandas [`TextParser`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/06d230151e6f18fdb8139d09abf539867a8cd481/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py#L1289) (used in `read_csv`, as per @GaelVaroquaux suggestion in #234) instead of `convert_dtypes` in the SuperVectorizer `_auto_cast` method. This has several advantages:\r\n\r\n- Type detection works on string columns, e.g `[\"3\", \"2\", \"1\"]` would get detected as integer. Solves #234 \r\n-  Missing values encoded as strings get treated as missing values, and don't prevent type detection. For instance,` [1, 2, \"\", 4]` is detected as integers. (solves  #231). Which strings get detected as Nans is easy to change (see below).\r\n- Datetime columns are converted to datetimes, and the format is inferred by Pandas. Solve the first part of #233.\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n- TODO: I'd like to enable the user to specify a specific date format if he wants to.\r\n- Strings detected as NaNs are the default [`STR_NA_VALUES`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_libs/parsers.pyx#L1350), and I've added `[None, \" \", \"?\", \"...\"]`. I think we could find a more principled way to choose which strings to include.\r\n- I haven't properly measured the speed of the conversion.\r\n- To use TextParser, I need to convert the input data into a list of list. I don't think this is a problem, but tell me if you think otherwise.\r\n- All variables which are not numerics or datetimes are converted to object (and thus handled as categorical in the SuperVectorizer).\r\n- Right now, if a datetime column contains mixed timezones, it is encoded as an object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6771123993,"node_id":"MIE_lADOB3LOgs5AHuG3zwAAAAGTlycZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/events/6771123993","actor":{"login":"LilianBoulard","id":33222654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjIyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33222654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard","html_url":"https://github.com/LilianBoulard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-08T15:44:55Z","milestone":{"title":"0.3.0 release"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6896173866,"node_id":"CE_lADOB3LOgs5AHuG3zwAAAAGbC0Mq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/events/6896173866","actor":{"login":"LeoGrin","id":45738728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzM4NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45738728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoGrin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoGrin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-28T17:54:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
