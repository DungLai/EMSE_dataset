Usually this package is installed with conda as defined in the .travis.yml file, but it is not the case anymore. When looking at https://travis-ci.org/github/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/builds/637915880 (line to 868 to 976), it seems that the coverage package is pinned to version <5, which prevent codecov from being installed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33491786/79207172-a6394800-7e40-11ea-93b6-93fba3bf272b.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know how pinned specs are handled, for now a quick fix
