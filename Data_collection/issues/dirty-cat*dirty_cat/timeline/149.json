is a major refactor of the file ``fetching.py``, that is in charge of fetching datasets off the web.\r\nHistorically, they were fetched from various websites.\r\n\r\nOur aim with this update is to only use OpenML.org's API, through Scikit-learn's [``fetch_openml()``](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml.html) function.\r\nThis allows us to have a much more reliable and unified interface, and avoids losing access to datasets due to deletion, renaming, etc.\r\n\r\nFor instance, with the current system, 4 on the 7 datasets are unavailable (403 Access Denied, website down, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe user-interface stays the same with the functions ``fetch_*()`` (e.g ``fetch_open_payments()``), still returning a similar dictionary.\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing this, not all the datasets have been uploaded to OpenML ; I will take care of this in the coming week(s).\r\n\r\nNow unecessary code has been removed from ``utils.py`` files.\r\n\r\n*Note on the testing part: this is my first time experimenting with mocking

the file `count_3_ngrams.py` as it is a benchmark and is not used anywhere.\r\nFor the record, only the docstring seems interesting :\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuick benchmarking seems to show that pure Python code is faster when\r\nfor strings less that 1000 characters, and numpy versions is faster for\r\nlonger strings.\r\nVery long strings would benefit from probabilistic counting (bloom\r\nfilter, count min sketch) as implemented eg in the \"bounter\" module.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #149
