resolve issue #115. There was 2 problems with our implementation of the Jaro and Jaro-Winkler distance.\r\n- `search_range`, i.e. the maximum range when matching characters was different: `max_len // 2 -1` against `(min_len - 1) // 2`.\r\n- In some cases like `min_len <= 3`, the Jaro-Winkler distance wasn't computed even though we set `winkler=True`.\r\n\r\nI also added more thorough tests in `test_compare_implementations`.
