It then performs hierarchical clustering on the similarities between records to identify duplicates. There are three tricks/fancy things it uses on top of that:\r\n- It scales this by pre-selecting blocks of data to compare with each other based on (more computationally efficient) \"predicate functions\", e.g. only do full string comparison of records if they share the first three digits (+ many more predicate functions and combinations thereof), see [here](https://docs.dedupe.io/en/latest/how-it-works/Making-smart-comparisons.html#).\r\n- It computes a string similarity between two records for each field independently, i.e. 5 fields lead to 5 string similarities (between two records). Since not all fields are equally informative, it uses a logistic regression with similarity per field as features to predict whether something is a duplicate (and hence be able to down-weight certain fields via logistic reg. weights). It learns them via presenting the most uncertain examples to the user and collecting ground truth about whether they are duplicates from them.\r\n- It selects the cut-off for hierarchical clustering by precision/recall based on the ground truth data collected from the user via the active inference above.\r\n\r\nDisadvantage is clearly the complexity and maybe the reliance on user input, yet using logistic regression or similar for weighting different fields seems very useful.\r\n\r\n### Simplest alternative using native dirty_cat and scipy\r\n\r\n[This](https://mjboos.github.io/posts/2021/11/unsupervised-typo-finder/) example uses a similar principle, but much simplified using only dirty_cat and scipy clustering: For a single field compute similarities via `SimilarityEncoder`, then perform hierarchical clustering on this and let the user pick the cut-off. Basically the approach that dedupe takes using dirty_cat's string similarities without the fancy things above. It would struggle with scaling (always performs an all-to-all string similarity), doesn't have a principled way to do similarity across 2+ fields/columns jointly, and has no heuristic to pick the cut-off.\r\n\r\n### Building on FuzzyJoin\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to build this on the fuzzyjoin PR, since this already handles matching on multiple columns - but we might want to have better string similarity than n-gram CountVectorizer and for clustering (and potentially weighting columns differently) we might need user input/ground truth labels.\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\nIMO the biggest ones are:\r\n\r\n1. How much do we care about the ability to scale this to large datasets? Depending on this we might need to use a similar \"block comparisons only\" strategy that dedupe uses.\r\n2. Do you want to have a dirty_cat user experience that requires input by users, i.e. to get ground truth labels of duplicates?\r\n\r\nIt also would be interesting to allow generic similarities, e.g. using something like similarity in a gapencoder-derived vector space could be interesting.\r\n\r\n@GaelVaroquaux @LilianBoulard

PR implements a basic `deduplicate` function (see discussion in #306 ).\r\nIt is based on computing n-gram tfidf distances between unique words in a column (same as for `fuzzy_join`), hierarchically clustering the distance matrix, then deduplicating by picking the most frequent exemplar in each cluster as the \"correct\" spelling.\r\n\r\nOpen design question: Should this be a function or a class? It clearly has a state (and could be useful when \"trained\" on a large set of dirty categories and then applied to new incoming data) - but saving a translation table in a class would be costly. An alternative would be to go from a clustered distance matrix to a K-means representation based on string distances (where each centroid is the most frequent cluster exemplar).\r\n\r\nIt's currently WIP because I still want to add an example/documentation.\r\n\r\nFWIW this function was immediately useful in my work, but its usefulness depends on the structure of your data:\r\nIf there are few underlying categories, which might be corrupted by typos or alternative spellings, then it should work well out of the box.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/339/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7855964243,"node_id":"RTE_lADOB3LOgs5RDeOxzwAAAAHUQIBT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/events/7855964243","actor":{"login":"jovan-stojanovic","id":62058944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDU4OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62058944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/jovan-stojanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovan-stojanovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-21T10:23:02Z","rename":{"from":"FuzzyJoin / deduplication","to":"Deduplication"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
