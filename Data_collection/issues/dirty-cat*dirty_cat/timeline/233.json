pandas [`TextParser`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/06d230151e6f18fdb8139d09abf539867a8cd481/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py#L1289) (used in `read_csv`, as per @GaelVaroquaux suggestion in #234) instead of `convert_dtypes` in the SuperVectorizer `_auto_cast` method. This has several advantages:\r\n\r\n- Type detection works on string columns, e.g `[\"3\", \"2\", \"1\"]` would get detected as integer. Solves #234 \r\n-  Missing values encoded as strings get treated as missing values, and don't prevent type detection. For instance,` [1, 2, \"\", 4]` is detected as integers. (solves  #231). Which strings get detected as Nans is easy to change (see below).\r\n- Datetime columns are converted to datetimes, and the format is inferred by Pandas. Solve the first part of #233.\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n- TODO: I'd like to enable the user to specify a specific date format if he wants to.\r\n- Strings detected as NaNs are the default [`STR_NA_VALUES`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/_libs/parsers.pyx#L1350), and I've added `[None, \" \", \"?\", \"...\"]`. I think we could find a more principled way to choose which strings to include.\r\n- I haven't properly measured the speed of the conversion.\r\n- To use TextParser, I need to convert the input data into a list of list. I don't think this is a problem, but tell me if you think otherwise.\r\n- All variables which are not numerics or datetimes are converted to object (and thus handled as categorical in the SuperVectorizer).\r\n- Right now, if a datetime column contains mixed timezones, it is encoded as an
