Calling `GapEncoder.get_feature_names()` several times in a row can in rares cases return different labels between calls. This is because `get_feature_names` calls `transform` to encode potential labels and decide which ones are the most relevant for each topic. However `transform` returns slightly different activations H over multiple calls on the same input X, because it keeps the fitted activations H from the previous call to continue the optimization, instead of starting from scratch every time.\r\nThese slightly different encodings H can lead to small changes in topic labels.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
