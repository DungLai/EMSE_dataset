part of the work I'm putting in #277, I noticed the way we're handling the usage of `get_feature_names` since the transition to `get_feature_names_out` (sklearn 1.0) is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the `GapEncoder` and the `SuperVectorizer`, we raise a warning no matter the installed version of scikit-learn, and in the `DatetimeEncoder`, we don't warn at all.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we should be checking sklearn's version beforehand, and warn only if appropriate.\r\n\r\nHere's a template for this behavior: \r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef get_feature_names(*args, **kwargs):\r\n    if Version(sklearn.__version__) >= '1.0':\r\n        warn(\r\n            \"Following the changes in scikit-learn 1.0, \"\r\n            \"get_feature_names is deprecated. \"\r\n            \"Use get_feature_names_out instead.\",\r\n            DeprecationWarning\r\n        )\r\n    return self.get_feature_names_out(*args, **kwargs)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"LilianBoulard","id":33222654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjIyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33222654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard","html_url":"https://github.com/LilianBoulard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
