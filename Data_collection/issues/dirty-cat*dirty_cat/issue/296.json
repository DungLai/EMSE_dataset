a brief description of the bug.-->\r\nWhen passing an already \"clean\" dataset to the `SuperVectorizer` (which is common in generic pipelines), it raises a `RuntimeError` as `No transformers could be generated!`.\r\nThe doc mentions\r\n```\r\nRaises\r\n------\r\nRuntimeError\r\n    If no transformers could be constructed,\r\n    usually because transformers passed do not match any column.\r\n    To fix the issue, try passing the least amount of None as encoders.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, I think the message could be reworded, as it's not very clean what \"no transformers being generated\" means.\r\nSecondly, I think it should be a warning (at best), not an error.","closed_by":{"login":"LilianBoulard","id":33222654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjIyNjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33222654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard","html_url":"https://github.com/LilianBoulard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilianBoulard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/296/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
