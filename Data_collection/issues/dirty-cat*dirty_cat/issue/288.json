issue is linked with #287.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I used the `Literal` type hint, which allows us to specify a set of possible values a parameter can take:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Literal\r\n\r\n\r\ndef func(status: Literal['on', 'off']) -> bool:\r\n    return {\r\n        'on': True,\r\n        'off': False,\r\n    }[status]\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc('on')\r\n# True\r\n\r\nfunc('off')\r\n# False\r\n\r\nfunc('down')\r\n# ValueError, but if your IDE supports type hinting, it should have told you !\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realized this feature was introduced in `typing` (the builtin library for type hinting) in Python 3.8.\r\n\r\nOur current minimal requirement for Python is version 3.6, which was released in [December 2016](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/), and [has stopped receiving updates in December 2021](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/stop-using-python-3.6/).\r\n\r\nConsidering this, and the fact that it was released over 5 years ago, I think we should update.\r\n[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) (released June 2018) has a bunch of new features, notably dataclasses, which could be used for the dataset fetching code.\r\n[Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) (released October 2019) also has a bunch of new features, notably the walrus operator and the equal-ending f-strings.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, the main reason why I'm arguing here, the `Literal` type !\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the release is almost two and a half years old, [and so is our minimal requirement of numpy](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/releases/tag/0.22), so I think it should be safe to upgrade for dirty_cat 0.3.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think
