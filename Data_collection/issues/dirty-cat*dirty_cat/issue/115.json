The dirty_cat implementation uses the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) definition: two characters from s1 and s2 are considered matching only if they are the same and not farther than\r\n`int(max(|s1|,|s2|) / 2) - 1` = 1 in my example.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Levensthein implementation seems to use `int( (min(|s1|,|s2|) + 1) / 2)` = 2.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"GaelVaroquaux","id":208217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODIxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux","html_url":"https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
