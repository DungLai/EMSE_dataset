Msahraeian\r\nThanks for the quick response.\r\nI followed your instruction and successfully rerun a standalone test of chr1 of my sample data, but I have a couple of questions I’d like to get your help.\r\n\r\n  1.  I basically use the same code as the testing script, but substitute the ref genome, bed, tumor bam and normal bam, I use the NeuSomatic_v0.1.4_standalone_SEQC-WGS-Spike.pth as pretrained model and ran the three steps preprocess/call/postprocess, is this the right way?\r\n  2.  Is “work_standalone/NeuSomatic_standalone.vcf” the final variant call result? The reason I am asking is because the number of variant (270) is almost  triple that in the grand truth (95), which represent a lot of false positive even before a comparison. Maybe the parameters need to adjust or the pretrained model is not a good match?\r\n  3.  I saw in the paper, you use cll sample and got very good results. I al so have the sample and grand truth, I’d like to follow your protocol to do it, I also have the DREAM sets mentioned in your paper. Would you let me know the parameters and trained model you use so that I can re-run?\r\n  4.  If it is necessary, I’d like to learn bamsuegeon and produce my own trained model, so any information about how you did spike in would also be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\nXiaopeng Bian\r\nCBIIT/NCI\r\n\r\nFrom: msahraeian <notifications@github.com>\r\nSent: Sunday, November 24, 2019 3:17 AM\r\nTo: bioinform/neusomatic <neusomatic@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Bian, Xiaopeng (NIH/NCI) [E] <bianxi@mail.nih.gov>; Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [bioinform/neusomatic] failed at the last step (#53)\r\n\r\n\r\n@cbiitbian<https://github.com/cbiitbian> happy to see your interest in NeuSomatic.

\r\n1. Yes, it should be the right steps to go. You may also set the number of threads based on your resources. Another important note is that on the test script I used min AF of 5%. If it is too high for your sample, you can modify the parameters. For our new [SEQC-II robustness analysis paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/667261), we use the following setting:  `--scan_maf 0.01 --min_mapq 10 --snp_min_af 0.03 --snp_min_bq 15 --snp_min_ao 3 --ins_min_af 0.02 --del_min_af 0.02`. \r\n2. Each variant call is assigned a quality score in the VCF. Based on this score we categorized the calls to three classes PASS (score>=0.7), LowQUAL (0.4<=score<0.7), and REJECT (score<0.4). This is the default limits we use. You can modify these limits in the postprocessing step using input parameters. You should then use the PASS calls for analysis. \r\n3. For real samples in [NatureComm paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09027-x), we used DREAM challenge model `NeuSomatic_v0.1.3_standalone_Dream3.pth` to infer. There, we used 0.97 pass threshold for CLL1 and COLO-829 samples. For the DREAM challenge stage 3 we also used DREAM challenge model to infer with 0.7 pass threshold. For the [SEQC-II robustness analysis paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/667261), we used the default 0.7 pass threshold for whole analysis. With the [new SEQC trained models](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#trained-network-models), 0.7 pass threshold should give you similar accuracy on CLL1 and COLO samples. \r\n4. You can find the information on how to use BAMSurgeon to spike in mutations [here](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#creating-training-data).\r\n\r\nAlso note that the best performance is usually achieved in the ensemble

question, I am running WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) sample, do you have trained model for that or I can use WGS model? I saw you have a older model for WEX, “NeuSomatic_v0.1.0_standalone_WEX_100purity.pth”, is that a WES model I can use?\r\nThanks.\r\nXiaopeng\r\n\r\nFrom: msahraeian <notifications@github.com>\r\nSent: Tuesday, November 26, 2019 12:51 AM\r\nTo: bioinform/neusomatic <neusomatic@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Bian, Xiaopeng (NIH/NCI) [E] <bianxi@mail.nih.gov>; Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [bioinform/neusomatic] failed at the last step (#53)\r\n\r\n\r\n@cbiitbian<https://github.com/cbiitbian>\r\n\r\n  1.  Yes, it should be the right steps to go. You may also set the number of threads based on your resources. Another important note is that on the test script I used min AF of 5%. If it is too high for your sample, you can modify the parameters. For our new SEQC-II robustness analysis paper<https://doi.org/10.1101/667261>, we use the following setting: --scan_maf 0.01 --min_mapq 10 --snp_min_af 0.03 --snp_min_bq 15 --snp_min_ao 3 --ins_min_af 0.02 --del_min_af 0.02.\r\n  2.  Each variant call is assigned a quality score in the VCF. Based on this score we categorized the calls to three classes PASS (score>=0.7), LowQUAL (0.4<=score<0.7), and REJECT (score<0.4). This is the default limits we use. You can modify these limits in the postprocessing step using input parameters. You should then use the PASS calls for analysis.\r\n  3.  For real samples in NatureComm paper<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09027-x>, we used DREAM challenge model NeuSomatic_v0.1.3_standalone_Dream3.pth to infer. There, we used 0.97 pass threshold for CLL1 and COLO-829 samples. For the DREAM challenge stage 3 we also used DREAM challenge model to infer with 0.7 pass threshold. For the SEQC-II robustness analysis paper<https://doi.org/10.1101/667261>, we used the default 0.7 pass threshold for whole analysis. With the new SEQC trained models<https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#trained-network-models>, 0.7 pass threshold should give you similar accuracy on CLL1 and COLO samples.\r\n  4.  You can find the information on how to use BAMSurgeon to spike in mutations here<https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#creating-training-data>.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the best performance is usually
