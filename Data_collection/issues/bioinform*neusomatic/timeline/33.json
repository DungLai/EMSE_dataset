@kiranchari In the absence of real cancer samples with comprehensive ground truth, we are limited to measure sensitivity, and we are unable to accurately measure precision. So, we went one step further and also reported \"extrapolated precision\" as the percentage of predicted somatic mutations that have been called by at least two stand-alone methods, or have been reported as verified somatic mutations in at least two samples of the same cancer type in COSMIC database. We then compute extrapolated F1-score based on the harmonic mean of recall and this extrapolated precision. \r\nAs you said, it may be biased towards the other callers output to some extent.
