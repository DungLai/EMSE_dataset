For instance you can run `java -jar picard.jar ValidateSamFile I=chr19.bam R=ref.fa MODE=SUMMARY` and see if it reports any bugs. \r\n\r\nWe also need MD tag in the bam file. As explained in README, you can make sure your bam has MD tag by: \r\n```\r\nsamtools calmd -@ num_threads -b alignment.bam reference.fasta  > alignment.md.bam \r\nsamtools index alignment.md.bam\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/425427771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1873457876,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg3MzQ1Nzg3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1873457876","actor":{"login":"vendig","id":26358653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU4NjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig","html_url":"https://github.com/vendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-28T12:59:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1873457878,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NzM0NTc4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1873457878","actor":{"login":"vendig","id":26358653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU4NjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig","html_url":"https://github.com/vendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-28T12:59:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/425461344","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/10#issuecomment-425461344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/10","id":425461344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTQ2MTM0NA==","user":{"login":"roger-liu-bina","id":21229438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI5NDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21229438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina","html_url":"https://github.com/roger-liu-bina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roger-liu-bina/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T14:52:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T14:52:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vendig

So, we are almost there :)\r\nFor the new error, I tried to run your test case (Dream challenge stage 3 on chr19), but was not able to reproduce your error, and my run finished successfully. \r\nWould you please make sure you have the right pysam version (0.14.1)? \r\nAlso, please make sure you delete the work folder  (work_standalone) after you have fixed the MD tag problem, and do a fresh run again. \r\nAnother suggestions I can have is to restrict the region_bed file to your target region so if you only care about chromosome 19, restrict it to
