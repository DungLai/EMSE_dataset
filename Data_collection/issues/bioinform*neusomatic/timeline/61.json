For each sample run `preprocess.py`. This will you give you per sample candidate TSV files in the following paths: `sample_i_output/dataset/work.*/candidates*.tsv`\r\n2. Use all the candidate TSV files from multiple samples together to buil a NeuSomatic model using `train.py`. So, as `--candidates_tsv` argument you can provide paths to all candidate TSVs, like: \r\n\r\n`--candidates_tsv sample_*_output/dataset/work.*/candidates*.tsv` \r\nOR\r\n ```\r\n--candidates_tsv sample_1_output/dataset/work.*/candidates*.tsv \\\r\n sample_2_output/dataset/work.*/candidates*.tsv ... \\\r\n sample_n_output/dataset/work.*/candidates*.tsv ...
