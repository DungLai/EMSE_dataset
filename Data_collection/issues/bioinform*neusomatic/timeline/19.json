If it's from GATK3, this is the email I went to a previous user:\r\n\r\n> I think the reason is that my program assumes GATK4's MuTect2, where the header includes information regarding tumor/normal sample names, i.e., \r\n> ##normal_sample=WGS_NS_N\r\n> ##tumor_sample=WGS_NS_T\r\n> \r\n> It's probably better to use GATK4's mutect2. It's quite a bit faster, too.\r\n> \r\n> You can also try to add those two lines to your mutect2's header, i.e., \r\n> **##normal_sample=NORMAL\r\n> ##tumor_sample=TUMOR**\r\n> \r\n> So it'll know which column is
