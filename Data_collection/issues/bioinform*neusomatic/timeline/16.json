If you don't have specific preferences, you can use the whole-genome as your target region. You can obtain such bed file using your reference `.fai` index file:\r\n```\r\ncat reference.fasta.fai | awk -F \"\\t\" '{print $1 \"\\t0\\t\" $2}' | awk -F \"\\t\" '$1 ~ /^(chr)?[0-9XYMT]+$/' > region.bed\r\n```\r\n2- It depends on your goal. In general if you train and call on the same region of same tumor/normal pair, you will cause overtraining. But, if you want to train on a tumor/normal pair sample and call on other samples, the regions used for training and calling can be the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/429991211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1905067714,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkwNTA2NzcxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1905067714","actor":{"login":"sugyun","id":22545969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ1OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22545969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun","html_url":"https://github.com/sugyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-15T19:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1905067715,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MDUwNjc3MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1905067715","actor":{"login":"sugyun","id":22545969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ1OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22545969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun","html_url":"https://github.com/sugyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-15T19:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/430467838","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/16#issuecomment-430467838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/16","id":430467838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDQ2NzgzOA==","user":{"login":"sugyun","id":22545969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ1OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22545969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun","html_url":"https://github.com/sugyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sugyun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T02:31:28Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T02:31:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@msahraeian
