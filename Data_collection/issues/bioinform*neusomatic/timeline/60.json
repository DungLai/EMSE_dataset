If you don't have a training data with known truth VCF: as noted [here](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#creating-training-data) to generate training data  you should follow the BAMSurgeon workflow that gives you synthetic bams and truth vcf file (In fact it gives a `synthetic_snvs.vcf` and a `synthetic_indels.leftAlign.vcf`. you need to combine them to a single VCF). These training data can then be used in NeuSomatic.\r\n\r\n2. Regardless of how you get your data you can run NeuSomatic in standalone or ensmeble modes (in training or calling phases). Details can be found [here](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic#ensemble-mode). The process you mentioned with give you `ensemble_ann.tsv` that can be used in ensemble mode. So, this tsv file is only output of other callers for your data and should not be used as truth vcf.\r\n\r\nIn addition, from the few lines of the VCF you have provided, I see that the VCF is in the wrong format. You need a header line like `##fileformat=VCFv4.2` in the first line of VCF that specifies the format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/609089958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3200546908,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIwMDU0NjkwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/3200546908","actor":{"login":"gianfilippo","id":10429140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI5MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10429140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo","html_url":"https://github.com/gianfilippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-04T21:14:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3200546909,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMDA1NDY5MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/3200546909","actor":{"login":"gianfilippo","id":10429140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI5MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10429140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo","html_url":"https://github.com/gianfilippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-04T21:14:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/609115300","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/60#issuecomment-609115300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/60","id":609115300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTExNTMwMA==","user":{"login":"gianfilippo","id":10429140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI5MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10429140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo","html_url":"https://github.com/gianfilippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianfilippo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-05T01:46:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T
