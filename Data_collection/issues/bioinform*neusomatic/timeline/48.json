The SEQC models (like `NeuSomatic_v0.1.4_standalone_SEQC-WGS-Spike.pth` for standalone mode and `NeuSomatic_v0.1.4_ensemble_SEQC-WGS-Spike.pth` for ensemble mode) are shown in [our preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/667261) to have high robustness across different conditions. So, you may try to use those models. Although as in other deep learning frameworks, users should note that there may be situations that the pre-trained models may not always work as perfectly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/526879329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2599114968,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU5OTExNDk2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2599114968","actor":{"login":"kokyriakidis","id":33731293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzMxMjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33731293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis","html_url":"https://github.com/kokyriakidis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-01T02:05:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2599114969,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1OTkxMTQ5Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2599114969","actor":{"login":"kokyriakidis","id":33731293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzMxMjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33731293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis","html_url":"https://github.com/kokyriakidis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokyriakidis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-01T02:05:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
