What you can do is to split the WG region to smaller chunks (like 1M bases) and run neusomatic on each separately. You can split your region file using \r\n\r\n```\r\npython split_bed.py \\\r\n\t--region_bed region.bed \\\r\n\t--output work \\\r\n\t--num_splits 3000\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/552177148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2785877518,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc4NTg3NzUxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2785877518","actor":{"login":"jingmeng-bioinformatics","id":35085665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDg1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35085665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics","html_url":"https://github.com/jingmeng-bioinformatics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-10T09:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2785877519,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3ODU4Nzc1MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2785877519","actor":{"login":"jingmeng-bioinformatics","id":35085665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDg1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35085665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics","html_url":"https://github.com/jingmeng-bioinformatics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-10T09:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/552247581","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/52#issuecomment-552247581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/52","id":552247581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjI0NzU4MQ==","user":{"login":"jingmeng-bioinformatics","id":35085665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDg1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35085665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics","html_url":"https://github.com/jingmeng-bioinformatics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingmeng-bioinformatics/subscriptions","o
