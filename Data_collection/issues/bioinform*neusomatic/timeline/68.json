I guess you are running `somaticseq_parallel.py` in single sample mode (tumor-only). But, you need to run it in tumor-normal paired mode. You can find the example command [here](https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq#run-somaticseq-with-an-example-command).\r\n\r\n2. You need both of `Ensemble.sSNV.tsv` and `Ensemble.sINDEL.tsv`. If you have them ready, you can run the following command to combine them:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat <(cat Ensemble.sSNV.tsv |grep CHROM|head -1) \\\r\n    <(cat Ensemble.sSNV.tsv Ensemble.sINDEL.tsv |grep -v CHROM) | sed \"s/nan/0/g\" > ensemble_ann.tsv\r\n```\r\nand provide `ensemble_ann.tsv` as `--ensemble_tsv` argument in `preprocess.py`.\r\n\r\n3- Take note that if you are using the pre-trained models, you should use the same set of callers used for training. For instance if you are using the SEQC-II models (which are the recommended ones), you should use MuTect2, MuSE, Strelka2, SomaticSniper, VarDict.\r\n\r\n4- We also have a Dockerized solution for running all of the individual somatic callers and a wrapper that combines their output [here](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/tree/master/ensemble_docker_pipelines). It has not been updated lately, so the tools may be old. But, it is an alternative for you. Just please drop VarScan if you are using SEQC-II model.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/745760147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4117797295,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDExNzc5NzI5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/4117797295","actor":{"login":"JunhakAhn","id":37726041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI2MDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37726041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn","html_url":"https://github.com/JunhakAhn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-16T04:43:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4117797297,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMTc3OTcyOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/4117797297","actor":{"login":"JunhakAhn","id":37726041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI2MDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37726041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn","html_url":"https://github.com/JunhakAhn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunhakAhn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-16T04:43:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
