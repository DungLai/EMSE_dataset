Currently the code is designed based on Pytorch v0.3.1 and only works with that version. I think there are several other compatibility issues as well if you use v0.4.1. In future, we try to extend the code to make it work with later Pyorch versions. \r\n\r\nI would suggest to do a fresh miniconda installation; and then, try to follow the instructions in README to install python packages with right versions. You should be able to get all python packages through conda.\r\n\r\nBTW, please pull the latest commit on master as we have done some bug fixings.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/421618616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1847702880,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0NzcwMjg4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1847702880","actor":{"login":"vendig","id":26358653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU4NjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig","html_url":"https://github.com/vendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-15T19:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1847702881,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDc3MDI4ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/1847702881","actor":{"login":"vendig","id":26358653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU4NjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig","html_url":"https://github.com/vendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-15T19:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/421836101","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/8#issuecomment-421836101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/8","id":421836101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTgzNjEwMQ==","user":{"login":"vendig","id":26358653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU4NjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26358653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig","html_url":"https://github.com/vendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vendig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-16T21:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-16T21:24:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
