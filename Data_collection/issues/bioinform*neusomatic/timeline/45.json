What you need to do is to run preprocessing step for each sample separately. Then in the training process where you should provide `--candidates_tsv` you can include all the candidate files from all samples. Here is the detail:\r\n\r\n1-Preprocess for each sample. For example for sample 1:\r\n```\r\npython preprocess.py \\\r\n\t--mode train \\\r\n\t--reference GRCh38.fa \\\r\n\t--region_bed region.bed \\\r\n\t--tumor_bam tumor_1.bam \\\r\n\t--normal_bam normal_1.bam \\\r\n\t--work work_train_1 \\\r\n\t--truth_vcf truth_1.vcf \\\r\n\t--min_mapq 10 \\\r\n\t--number_threads 10 \\\r\n\t--scan_alignments_binary ../bin/scan_alignments\r\n```\r\n2-Train on sample_1 to sample_n:\r\n```\r\npython train.py \\\r\n\t--candidates_tsv work_train_1/dataset/*/candidates*.tsv work_train_2/dataset/*/candidates*.tsv \r\n ... work_train_n/dataset/*/candidates*.tsv \\\r\n\t--out work \\\r\n\t--num_threads 10 \\\r\n\t--batch_size 100 \r\n```\r\n3-Use the checkpoint from this multi-sample training to call variants on other samples.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/511668294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2484922212,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ4NDkyMjIxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2484922212","actor":{"login":"ggoodstudydaydayup","id":46480129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDgwMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46480129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup","html_url":"https://github.com/ggoodstudydaydayup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T05:16:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2484922213,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0ODQ5MjIyMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/events/2484922213","actor":{"login":"ggoodstudydaydayup","id":46480129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDgwMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46480129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup","html_url":"https://github.com/ggoodstudydaydayup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T05:16:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/comments/511691496","html_url":"https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/45#issuecomment-511691496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/45","id":511691496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTY5MTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"ggoodstudydaydayup","id":46480129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDgwMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46480129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup","html_url":"https://github.com/ggoodstudydaydayup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggoodstudydaydayup/repos","events_url":"https://api.
