I create a bed file as suggested in [issue 16](https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/16) and followed your recommendation for distributed data processing on a cluster. Unfortunately there are no candidates found in the preprocessing. Are there certain specifications for the vcf_truth file?
