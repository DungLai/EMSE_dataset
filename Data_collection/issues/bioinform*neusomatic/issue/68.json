I tried to run ensemble mode neusomatic.\r\nSince there was no 'SomaticSeq.Wrapper.sh' on 'https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq/blob/master/SomaticSeq.Wrapper.sh',\r\nI ran 'somaticseq_parallel.py' using recommended command on 'https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq/' and got 'Ensemble.sSNV.tsv' \r\n\r\nHowever, when I tried to run 'preprocess.py' of  NeuSomatic with Ensemble mode using 'Ensemble.sSNV.tsv' I got, \r\nI faced this exception.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nextract_ensemble     The following features are missing from ensemble file: ['nBAM_Z_Ranksums_EndPos', 'tBAM_Z_Ranksums_MQ', 'nBAM_Z_Ranksums_MQ', 'nBAM_Z_Ranksums_BQ', 'tBAM_Z_Ranksums_EndPos', 'tBAM_Z_Ranksums_BQ']\r\n\r\n  File \"preprocess.py\", line 435, in <module>\r\n    args.scan_alignments_binary)\r\n  File \"preprocess.py\", line 241, in preprocess\r\n    ensemble_bed = extract_ensemble(work, ensemble_tsv)\r\n  File \"neusomatic/python/generate_dataset.py\", line 1296, in extract_ensemble\r\n    raise Exception\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSeems the issue is related to the 'Ensemble.sSNV.tsv' and the problem is that it does not have upper features including 'nBAM_Z_Ranksums_EndPos', ... \r\n\r\nIs there any process did I do wrong? or How can I get an exact ensemble SNV file with whole features to run Neusomatic ensemble mode without any issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAhn\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
