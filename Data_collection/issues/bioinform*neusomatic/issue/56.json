Do I have that right?  Are there any plans to develop a similar pipeline using [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity)?  \r\n\r\nLooks like the somaticseq project has already created a [similar variant](https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq/tree/master/utilities/singularities) so perhaps development would not be too complicated.  \r\n\r\nThanks for considering this request!
