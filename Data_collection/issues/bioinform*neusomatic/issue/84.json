Most of the somatic mutations called can be confirmed visually through IGV.\r\n\r\nHowever, we found that very small proportion of the called variants (~1%) have no rare allele at all (AO=0), despite passing QC. The variant is not seen through IGV, nor is it within any of the VCFs created before the Ensemble step. For each of these false SNVs, I've found a corresponding deletion (~20-40nt in length) called pre-ensemble with a starting coordinate 1nt upstream of the SNV (e.g. if the false variant was called chrX:123456C>A, a deletion would have been called at position chrX:123455). I've evaluated 7 examples, and in all 7 cases, this corresponding deletion was present.  \r\n\r\nIs this a known bug, and if so, do you know how it could be avoided in the future?
