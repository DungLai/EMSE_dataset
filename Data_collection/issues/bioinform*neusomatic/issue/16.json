How do I make bed file from my bam file? Do you have any recommand?  (ex bedtools bamtobed) which bam file (ref / normal / tumor) should I use?\r\n\r\n2. If i use different bed file for calling, do I have to train the model again with different bed file?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"msahraeian","id":11095648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk1NjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11095648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian","html_url":"https://github.com/msahraeian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msahraeian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
