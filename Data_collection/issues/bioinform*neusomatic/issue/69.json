I think this is one of the most impressive works in the field of somatic mutation calling. I'm very interested in it. And I'd like to reproduce some evaluation results mentioned in your paper. But now I've problem in producing synthetic training data with different tumor purity and normal contamination ratio. It seems that this [link](https://github.com/bioinform/somaticseq/tree/master/utilities/dockered_pipelines/bamSimulator) didn't describe the details about producing training data with different tumor purity. I hope you can help me solve this problem.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nZekun\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ZekunYin","id":2842153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2842153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZekunYin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZekunYin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
