(I have had a good experience using the stand-alone method so first off I just want to say thanks for the great tool!)\r\n\r\nError:\r\n    line 1350, in extract_ensemble:   s = ensemble_data[:, np.array(i_s)]\r\n    IndexError: arrays used as indices must be of integer (or boolean) type\r\n\r\nSome background: I am currently running a test of one sample where I have a matched tumor & normal bam files, in addition to mutect2, strelka2 (indels/SNV), and vardict vcf files. I have generated the ensemble_ann.tsv as described in the documentation but when providing it to the preprocess.py script, this error is thrown. \r\n\r\nThe line of this error is from the generate_dataset.py script https://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/blob/d2dd889c9deaa2ca8490496284f3e48fb381abd8/neusomatic/python/generate_dataset.py#L1350 \r\nAnd so my question is that I'm hoping someone could explain and help me understand better, where and what the variable **\"i_s\"** is being defined as. \r\n\r\nI noticed earlier on in this function, that on the lines 1267 & 1268, float values are being appended to \"ensemble_data\" so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the above error. I do think that understanding the **\"i_s\"** variable more could help me narrow down the source of my error, so if anyone has any suggestion or other opinions, they would be greatly appreciated!\r\nhttps://github.com/bioinform/neusomatic/blob/d2dd889c9deaa2ca8490496284f3e48fb381abd8/neusomatic/python/generate_dataset.py#L1267\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nStephanie\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"smalysz1","id":17073297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDczMjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17073297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1","html_url":"https://github.com/smalysz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalysz1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bioinform/neusomatic/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
