If, for example, I have segmentations depicting two different structures, do I populate the 'label array' with two values that correspond with the given structures.\n\nSo, 'labels' will be of the form : [x,y] where x and y are equal to the intensity values of the 2 structures, respectively?\n\nOr do I need to populate an array that's of the size of the image, such that each entry (each pixel) has a value associated with it?  Thank you, again.
