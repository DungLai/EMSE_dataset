The first one is for \"Registration With Auxiliary Data\" (as referenced to Voxelmorph- A learning framework for Deformable Medical Image registration). Is there an implementation for training with known segmentation labels in the github source (with Lseg loss from paper)?\r\n\r\nThe second one concerns the learning error curve that is oscillating near a small value as you can see below. I tried different lamdas (cvpr model with mse) without any chance. Is there any idea why this is happening?\r\n![cvprloss_slurm-109846](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32677031/70379010-54336380-1930-11ea-9575-4bdff3ad2ec4.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, I need a clarification for training. I understand that at an epoch the training concerns a 3d volume (for batch size=1). Could you specify what happens at every iteration inside each epoch?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":{"login":"theoVag","id":32677031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc3MDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32677031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag","html_url":"https://github.com/theoVag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
