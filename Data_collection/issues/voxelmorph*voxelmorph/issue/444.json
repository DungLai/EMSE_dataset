working on image reconstruction from motion corrupted MRI images and 2D/3D image registration.\r\n\r\nI would like to use your implementation of the ncc loss in pytorch.\r\n\r\nWhen adopting to pytorch it seems to me the \"compute_local_sums()\" function is only working for 3d data:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef compute_local_sums(I, J, filt, stride, padding, win):\r\n    I2 = I * I\r\n    J2 = J * J\r\n    IJ = I * J\r\n\r\n    I_sum = F.conv3d(I, filt, stride=stride, padding=padding)\r\n    J_sum = F.conv3d(J, filt, stride=stride, padding=padding)\r\n    I2_sum = F.conv3d(I2, filt,

np.prod(win)\r\n    u_I = I_sum / win_size\r\n    u_J = J_sum / win_size\r\n\r\n    cross = IJ_sum - u_J * I_sum - u_I * J_sum + u_I * u_J * win_size\r\n    I_var = I2_sum - 2 * u_I * I_sum + u_I *
