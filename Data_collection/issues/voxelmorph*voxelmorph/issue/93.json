Given a fixed (atlas image) and a moving image. In the training, we try to find a displacement field between the moving and the atlas image. Then the testing, we apply the trained displacement field to the new moving image. This step likes register a moving to the atlas image.\r\n\r\nIn real application, we have to regisger image of a subject to other subject. So, we cannot apply your method in this case but ants or flirt still work well. The reason is that your trained displacement filed is trained with paired of moving and atlas. And in my case, the fixed subject is not your atlas. Am I right?\r\n\r\nIf I am right, so your method may limited application. For example, we have t1 and t2 that capture from same subject. We have to register t2 to t1 to make them are alignment for segmentation. So, the moving is t2 and fixed is t1, not atlas. Do you think your idea still work for that case? For example, I have 10 subjects with t1 and t2 for training, and 5 subject with t1 and t2 for validation. After training 10 subjects, Can we make a displacement field that can register for 5 subjects. \r\n\r\nSorry if I ask so many question","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
