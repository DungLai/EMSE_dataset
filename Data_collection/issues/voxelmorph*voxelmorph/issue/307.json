The error is as follows:\r\nTypeError: Cannot convert a symbolic Keras input/output to a numpy array. This error may indicate that you're trying to pass a symbolic value to a NumPy call, which is not supported. Or, you may be trying to pass Keras symbolic inputs/outputs to a TF API that does not register dispatching, preventing Keras from automatically converting the API call to a lambda layer in the Functional Model.\r\nI guess the problem might be the LocalParamWithInput layer, but I don't know how to fix it.\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n![0Y{{@PD$21 MRUW08){3I%K](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32567042/117538255-ee24a180-b037-11eb-8865-8a84343f4e0c.png)\r\n![BQEO`JSC6$5 _XX~`%5JHDW](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32567042/117538257-f086fb80-b037-11eb-9c90-02d77e70ee49.png)\r\n![E }SE$8AD$MUI63V3TUI1UV](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32567042/117538258-f11f9200-b037-11eb-853a-c9a6db6f6d25.png)\r\n![R2S87H4%L _W R6B$J24B1V](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32567042/117538259-f1b82880-b037-11eb-9017-bfab4a45f4a3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
