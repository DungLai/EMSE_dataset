During the test, I tried to get the integration of the velocity field at different time points. I modified the scaling_and_squaring method to get it.  Core code here：\r\n```\r\n    if out\\_time\\_pt == 0:\r\n        pass\r\n    else:\r\n        vec = vec // (2 ** nb_steps)\r\n        for _ in range(out_time_pt): #here out\\_time\\_pt changes from 0~7\r\n            vec += my\\_transform(vec, vec)\r\n```\r\nHere are the results of pos\\_flow: (test only on one task, digital 7 here)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31833999/113610549-93b9af00-964d-11eb-8264-cd9e1492ce6d.png)\r\nI found that changing the variable out\\_time\\_pt  will not cause a big change of final pos\\_flow, and there is already a relatively good registration field at the initial point t=0. To further prove, I visualized the output of the flow layer (the layer before the VecInt layer)：\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31833999/113611391-bac4b080-964e-11eb-9a5e-d9273b47d5c5.png)\r\nIt seems that the model can learn a good registration field before the integration layer; the function of the integration layer is more like to ‘refine,’ resulting in a more refined registration result.\r\n\r\nBut according to my understanding, the results should be as shown in the picture in your another article: Unsupervised Learning\r\nof Probabilistic Diffeomorphic Registration for Images and Surfaces\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31833999/113611635-14c57600-964f-11eb-81c2-7ad2862e3349.png)\r\nCan you give me some suggestions on how to get the results shown in the image above?\r\nI would be grateful for your advice!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Fjr9516","id":31833999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODMzOTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31833999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516","html_url":"https://github.com/Fjr9516","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
