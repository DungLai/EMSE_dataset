Why is the KL term averaged over volume size instead of summed?\r\n2. Why is setting λ=10000 equivalent to a diagonal standard deviation of 1 voxel for phi_z?\r\n\r\nExamples of averaging are here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/699d754f2ffb6b7a73aa471c83d510f1ac2d3268/src/losses.py#L228\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/699d754f2ffb6b7a73aa471c83d510f1ac2d3268/src/losses.py#L198\r\n\r\nI can imagine this averaging helps to keep the KL term in sensible range. However, I do not find any references of such averaging in the [MICCAI 2018](http://www.mit.edu/~adalca/files/papers/miccai2018_voxelmorph-pd.pdf) and [MedIA 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03545) papers. For as far as I understand the derivations, the averages should be summations. It would be nice if you could elaborate on this?\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that in the [MICCAI 2018](http://www.mit.edu/~adalca/files/papers/miccai2018_voxelmorph-pd.pdf) paper it is mentioned that \"the lambda factor is set to 10 000, which is equivalent to a diagonal standard deviation of 1 voxel for phi_z\". To me, lambda would be the precision of the gaussian prior. It is not completely clear to me how a precision of 10 000 matches a standard deviation of 1 voxel in phi_z.\r\n\r\nVery much looking forward to hearing your thoughts about this. \r\n\r\nBest, Tycho","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
