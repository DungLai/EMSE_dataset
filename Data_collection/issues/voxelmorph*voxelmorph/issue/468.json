I converted the segmentation labels from .png to .nii. and chose all the permutations of volumes as fixed and moving images.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why my registered/warped moving image has a very different intensity distribution than the original image. Sometimes with erroneous hollow patches. Please check the outputs below, the first image is the fixed image, the second image is the moving image and the third image is the registered moving image. This is causing very low dice scores (<10%) although similarity scores are in the range of 60-70%.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10846405/187094929-8cb6440f-eac3-4c13-8310-cf214547c3c3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10846405/187094941-952e7cb1-f125-46e5-836f-60f19d47c175.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10846405/187094956-559d5bfd-52a0-4eda-9d13-7fb45ffa0c6f.png)\r\n\r\nI have trained the same model on MSD http://medicaldecathlon.com/ and it works just fine.
