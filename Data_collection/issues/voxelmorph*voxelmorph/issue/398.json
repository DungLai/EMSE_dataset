Split each image to small patches. 0-1 norm for each patch. Use default parameters to train the model. Use NCC loss and lambda  = 1.\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\nThe loss didn't decrease. I try to print the result, and find that the moving image doesn't change a lot at first and the loss stay at [-0.2, 0.15]. Then after a few epoch, moving image starts to distort, the loss start to increase. The the output will be a black image or white image.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52573031/155763043-415f8cfb-1e6f-4343-93f0-27310395de7c.png)\r\nThe first subplot is the output, the second subplot is the moving image, the final subplot is the target.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52573031/155763223-6abcbd1e-1b40-4b8a-acaa-3cfb2d67c685.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Charles-Hu","id":52573031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTczMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52573031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu","html_url":"https://github.com/Charles-Hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charles-Hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
