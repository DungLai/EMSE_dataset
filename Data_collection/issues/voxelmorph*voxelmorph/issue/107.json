I use ANTs to execute the following command: \r\n```\r\nantsApplyTransforms \\\r\n-d 3 \\\r\n-i moving.nii.gz \\\r\n-o ANTs_warped.nii.gz \\\r\n-r Fixed.nii.gz \\\r\n-t wrap.nii.gz\r\n```\r\nI noticed that `wraped.nii.gz` and `ANTs_wraped.nii.gz` are different..`ANTs_wraped.nii.gz` just has a very small  change compared to `Moving.nii.gz`.\r\nWhy is `wraped.nii.gz` different from `ANTs_wrap.nii.gz`? Can you give me some tips?","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
