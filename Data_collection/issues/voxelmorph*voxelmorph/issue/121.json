Could you give me some reference (article or part of voxelmorph code) or the pipeline about the unconditional template construction? Also could you explain a bit the part of (s_m o Ï†) derivation (by spatial transforming each channel of s_m using linear interpolation) or spot it in the code?\r\nThanks in advance","closed_by":{"login":"theoVag","id":32677031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc3MDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32677031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag","html_url":"https://github.com/theoVag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theoVag/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
