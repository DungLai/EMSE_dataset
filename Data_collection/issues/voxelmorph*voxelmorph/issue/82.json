I really appreciate your decision of making it public and your availability in answering questions.\r\n\r\nI am currently trying to use the code for the registration of pre- and post-contrast breast mri volumes. I am using the miccai2018 network and, as I read in other posts, I normalized the intensity of the images in the range [0, 1]. I do not use any affine alignment because in principle pre- and post-contrast images should be already affinely aligned. The images are non-isotropic with a spacing of approximately [0.6, 0.6, 1.3].\r\n\r\nI lowered the learning rate because all the losses were going to NaN and I tried to run the miccai network both with the original parameter for image_sigma and prior_lambda and also with slightly different ones (0.07 and 1 respectively) but all the losses stay constant and I get weird warped images.\r\n\r\nDo you know what it can be possibly go wrong? Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nI hope I gave enough information about the problem and please feel free to ask any clarification.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"riccardosamperna","id":6599726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTk3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6599726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna","html_url":"https://github.com/riccardosamperna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
