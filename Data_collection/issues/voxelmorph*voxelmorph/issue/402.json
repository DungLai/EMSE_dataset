We do not need to change y.\r\nsee https://www.toolsou.com/en/article/220276803 \r\nOnly in this way, the second line in (4) can be derived to the third line in (4) using p(z|x,y)=p(x,y,z)/p(x,y).\r\n\r\nBesides, formula (5) has also verified my assumption.\r\n<img width=\"445\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13451757/157845035-daf6bc33-fb00-4b30-8f63-67dd085ed2e4.png\">\r\nthe z|x;y in the left should be changed to z|x,y as it is in the right. \r\n\r\nSo I assume that some of the semicolons( ; ) should be changed to comma( , ).
