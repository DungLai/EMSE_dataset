We work with worms brain data, some of the volume are segmented.\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nFor unsupervised, it works when we use arrays as input (\"generator\" similar to the one presented in the tutorial) and arrays as validation_data (homemade function, inspired by the generated mentioned above). It works but it's very slow and limited by the memory.\r\n\r\nFor semi-supervised and \"unsupervised 2.0\", we use the generator found in your repository (respectively semisupervised and volgen) for the x data but when we use the same generator for the validation_data, at the end of the first epoch, the fitting is stuck in an infinite loop or return val_loss equals to 0 at the end of each epoch. This also occurs when the semisupervised generator is called in a comprehension list in order to \"convert it\".\r\n\r\nThe training work just fine when the argument validation_data is left empty.\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\n\r\nWe want to train semi-supervised with a mix of segmented (segmentation with integer values between 0 and 7) and non-segmented data (segmentation is array of zeros)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
