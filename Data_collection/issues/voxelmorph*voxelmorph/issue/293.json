I have tried to run [train_hypermorph.py](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/dev/scripts/tf/train_hypermorph.py) these days. when I test the result,there is only the code of  [test.py](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/dev/scripts/tf/test.py), I don't know whether it is to test hypermorph. it seems that it is not used for test hypermorph in my opinion beacuse HyperVxmDense is not called in test.py.\r\nI would appreciate it if you could provide the test code for hypermorph.\r\n  I have read the [test.py](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/dev/scripts/tf/test.py), I don't  understand how the data is emitted in pair.txt . My test data and fixed image have been processed into. Npz format. I don't know if I need to change it. there are very few materials related to HyperMorph since it is released not so long ago. As a beginner, I am very eager to learn your latest research on HyperMorph. I will be very grateful if you can add some materials about how to test HyperMorph.\r\n Thank you again! I have learned a lot from your excellent work. Your rigorous attitude towards scientific research and the spirit of selfless dedication have always inspired me. thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"daxuemi","id":81818702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODE4NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81818702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi","html_url":"https://github.com/daxuemi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxuemi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
