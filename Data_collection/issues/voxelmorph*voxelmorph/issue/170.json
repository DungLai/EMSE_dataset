I am currently trying to reimplement the Miccai2018 model in PyTorch, but noticed that the model for it is not fully scripted. I have no problem designing the model myself based on the older Keras/TF model, but I was wondering if the `VecInt` and `SpatialTransformer` layers are fully functional.","closed_by":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
