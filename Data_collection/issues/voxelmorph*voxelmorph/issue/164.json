The base-net architecture is as [32, 32, 32, 32, 16, 6] where 6 refers to the fully-connected last layer, and the other early layers are exactly like with the Affine model of voxelmorph. Here is some paired CT/MR slices:\r\n\r\nhttp://s6.picofile.com/file/8392190192/myplot1.png\r\n\r\nThe model trained with adam (lr=1e-4) for 1000 epochs on 731 2D CT/MR pairs (80 ones for validation). The history is as follows:\r\n\r\nhttp://s6.picofile.com/file/8392190242/MI8_ep1000.png\r\n\r\nBut, finally, the outcome was not satisfying both on the validation and test data, like the followings:\r\n\r\nA validation data: http://s6.picofile.com/file/8392190226/1_val.png\r\nA test data: http://s7.picofile.com/file/8392190234/2_test.png\r\n\r\nI do not know why?! but the model with 'mse' loss function on 500 epochs was more satisfiable, though we are speaking about multimodal registration. I should note that both the train (val), and test data contain both T1 and T2 MRIs to make the problem more challenging, yet with image normalization we have done as a pre-processing, it should not be the source of problem, I am not sure. \r\n\r\nAs a random guess, I am suspicious about MI loss with only 8 bins, and what do you think about 16 bins (unfortunately, the system cannot progress with more bins). \r\n\r\nYour help is highly appreciated. Thanks and regards. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
