I have some questions about voxelmorph as follows.\r\n(1)  What is the difference between setting indexing as \"ij\" and \"xy\" in the spatial transformer network?  \r\n       Will these two different values affect the deformation field?\r\n(2) In the tensorflow version code, if I have the position of a point in the  fixed image, how can I get the position of \r\n     the corresponding point in the moving image?  the  corresponding point  is calculated as follows:\r\n \r\n\r\n-    \r\n![企业微信截图_16627153218758](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40224130/189319667-0270c9ed-55f6-49a4-8d6b-489daef487f0.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
