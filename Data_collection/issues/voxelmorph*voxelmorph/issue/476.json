The dimension of my scans is 192,192,256, as per the tutorial the vol_shape comes out to be (192,192). In the tutorial it was similar, however the last dimension for the images was 1. When I sent these images to the model it gave an input dimension error  \"expected 192,192,1 got 192,192,256\". I tried changing src_feats to 256, this seemed to fix the input dimension issue but I get a very blurry template from this. \r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\nAs in the tutorial, adam loss is being used.\r\nAt the time of writing this issue I cannot provide inputs and outputs since they were discarded and I am unable to re run it due to some tensorflow issues. A detailed approach on template creation for 3d data would be really helpful. I have attached my code for reference.\r\n[vxm3DTemp.zip](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/files/9543361/vxm3DTemp.zip)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
