I had previously tried this in ANTs but was not getting the desired accuracy. Therefore, I was hoping to do it in Voxelmorph. So my questions are:\r\n\r\n1) Can I create a surgical atlas? (is there a function or code I can use for this?)\r\n2) For registration of the atlas (fixed) to moving image, I'd like to perform label propagation from the atlas to the new CT. What is the best recommended way to go about this?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!","closed_by":{"login":"codeenthusiast","id":6239462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6239462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast","html_url":"https://github.com/codeenthusiast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeenthusiast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
