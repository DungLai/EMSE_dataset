So instead of using voxelmorph to predict the affine/rigid (homography - H) matrix directly, we would use it to find keypoints between a pair of images (and then calculate H using cv.findHomography or similar). \r\n\r\nAny feedback much appreciated. Not asking/looking for a new package but for some general guidance/explanation on where this _link_ is and how this could be achieved. \r\n\r\nThanks ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
