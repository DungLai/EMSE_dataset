Currently I only have age (as a continuous variable, normalized to 0 to 1) as the pheno attribute. And I am wondering how to set up the model. Will the model work with only age as its pheno input?\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nI have build the model in PyTorch with the same setup as following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/7cf611ab283b22424d82650d6e17d49b986e7981/scripts/tf/train_cond_template.py#L140-L150\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have set `inshape` to [160, 192, 160], `pheno_input_shape` to 1, `src_feats` and `trg_feats` to 1 and left the rest of the arguments as default.\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\n\r\nI used MSE loss, and the same optimizer setting. I trained the model till convergence. But the model doesn't seem to be learning anything. For visualization of the result I got, see the images I uploaded to #450. It looks like the decoded pheno attribute (i.e. the residual) is still just a volume of random noise. I am not sure what is going on. I think @adalca mentioned in #450 that for your experiment two pheno attributes are used (i.e. age and sex). So I am guessing it might be the case that the model does not work with single pheno attribute. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/460/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
