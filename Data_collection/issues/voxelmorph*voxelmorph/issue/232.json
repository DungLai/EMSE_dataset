I am currently training a model for abdominal registration. However, I do face some problems when the data is input into the training pipeline in the 3D UNet step.\r\n\r\nI have resampled the moving image to the same resolution and dimension of the atlas target image. However it popped up some errors related to the size of feature. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54121206/98090165-4a202a80-1e49-11eb-849b-5a4107ae0485.png)\r\n\r\nThe image dimension is 512 x 512 x 434 and the resolution is. 0.86 x 0.86 x 0.86. Do you mind to take a look what the issue is?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
