In the beginning, I use the loss is [MI](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/ed94aa2c7f43565ef5220a087c1fa4b072348b51/voxelmorph/tf/losses.py#L318). I am not sure whether the Bins(bins = np.arange(0, 32, 1, dtype=np.float32)) is set correctly and the data is normalized. But MI is super heavy on GPU memory, so I gave it up. \r\nThen see the [MIND](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/pull/145#issue-372397584), it friendly to GPU memory, and seems to be effective.\r\nHowever, my data are real clinical data, that is, MRI images are incomplete and tilt at any angle after rigid registration . \r\n![Snipaste_2020-06-22_11-12-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7993631/85245289-b8a3b380-b479-11ea-90f3-3663147a8932.png)\r\n\r\nAfter registration with MIND ( tf version with diffeomorphic), I found that after deformation, MRI images would be forced to match to CT images, perhaps these pixels are not in MRI at all. I can't guarantee that the rigid body transformation is completely correct, so I can't just calculate where the MRI corresponds to the CT. Also because some of the data was too small I used the same size but difference spacing to ensure that the data I was cropping out would be padding the volume of fixed size.\r\n![Snipaste_2020-06-22_11-19-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7993631/85245476-4089bd80-b47a-11ea-85e8-0d9235e21d89.png)\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions to make my deformation small and correct, provided that the result of rigid body registration is robust? \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
