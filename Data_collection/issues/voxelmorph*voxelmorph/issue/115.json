I utilized similar parameters for Syn (including iteration times for each resolution and step size), however it only takes me ~20s for one pair of images, which was claimed to be ~9000s in the paper. \r\n\r\nI know the registration time can be heavily depadent on the parameter setup. Can I know what is the exact commend line for Ants Syn that you use to get the runtime stat in the table.
