I found the level of resolution pyramids an important parameter when using the iterative approach ([SimpleElastix](https://simpleelastix.github.io/)) on my data. Perhaps `--blurs` is the way to do something similar in VoxelMorph?\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\n- When training with the default `--blurs 1`, the convergence looks fine, but the test samples got very little transformations, which is similar to when using <3 resolution levels in the iterative approach.\r\n- I tried `--blurs 5 4 3 2 1`, the model did not converge well and gave strange transformations on test samples. In comparison, the results are very successful when using 5-7 resolution levels in the iterative approach.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am not using it correctly?\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\n\r\nI am using NMI loss with `--bidir`. \r\n\r\nThank in advance!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
