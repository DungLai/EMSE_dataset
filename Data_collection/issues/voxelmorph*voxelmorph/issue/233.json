For my use of voxelmorph, I need to apply some change to the deformation field and apply the deformation field back onto the moving image. I am having difficulty with applying the saved deformation field back onto an image. I tried looking at the registration code and using the `SpatialTransformer` to accomplish this. \r\nI have tried using this code:\r\n\r\n`y = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='linear', indexing='ij')([moving_img, warp])`\r\n\r\nwhere `moving_img` and `warp` are numpy images corresponding to the moving image and the warp transformation found from the registration. \r\n\r\nHowever, this gives me an error saying:\r\nAll inputs to the layer should be tensors.\r\n\r\nI have tried making both the `moving_img` and `warp` into tensors:\r\n\r\n`y = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='linear', indexing='ij')([tf.convert_to_tensor(moving, np.float32), tf.convert_to_tensor(warp, np.float32)])`\r\n\r\nThis gives me this error:\r\nException: Offset flow field size expected: 1, found: 3\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can apply the warp transformation from register.py back onto an image in voxelmorph?\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
