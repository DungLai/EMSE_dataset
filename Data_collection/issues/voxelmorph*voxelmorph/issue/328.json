I thought the unit of deformation amount was millimeter. But the exported deformation amounts didn't match the manually calculated one.\r\nPlease help me. what is the unit of the predicted amount of deformation (mm, voxel, or something else?)?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Rcnlover","id":47130227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTMwMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47130227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover","html_url":"https://github.com/Rcnlover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rcnlover/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
