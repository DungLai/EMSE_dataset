I also want to wrap the contour (annotation points). The Red curve is the contour of left ventricle (LV) of fixed_image, the blue curve is obtained by wrapping the red curve.  I was thinking: the wrapping of contour in the fixed_image would match the moving_image, but it seems not doing so. \r\nFrom ES to ED, comparing the moving and moved images, I can see the LV is obviously enlarged, however, the warped contour (blue curve) does not obviously shrinkedâ€¦ did I wrap the contour correctly?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148211043-bb0aa209-8657-4b7c-8c55-835062162a49.png)\r\n\r\nI use these code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148211201-9169275e-933e-4cb4-b967-2f1baf99e6b0.png)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for helping out!
