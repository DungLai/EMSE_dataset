Dear author. Great work! I am using voxelmorph for pulmonary image registration\r\nI trained the model using `miccai2018.py`, and then registered a pair of images using` register.py`. \r\nThe ` register.py` outputs the `warp image` and the `displacement vector field`. My image size is `224x144x192`. \r\nI noticed the size of  `warp image` size is `224x144x192`, and  the size of  `displacement vector field` size is `112x72x96x6`. I'm a bit confused. \r\n1. Why is the size of  `displacement vector field` `112x72x96x6` instead of `224x144x192x3`? \r\n2. What does a displacement vector field of size `112x72x96x6` mean?\r\n3. Can I get a `displacement vector field` of size `224x144x192x3`, just like cvpr model.","closed_by":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
