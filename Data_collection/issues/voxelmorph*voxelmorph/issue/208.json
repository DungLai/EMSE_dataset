I'm trying to register paired CT / MR images of the brain and I'm using a combination of MI and displacement field smoothness loss, with regularization parameter of 2.0 following recommendation from the master thesis of Courtney Guo. However, I noticed that the smoothness loss is on the scale of 1e-5, while the MI term is on the scale of 1e-1. Is the range of the smoothness loss value typical?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel_losses= [losses.localMutualInformation(np.linspace(0,1,32), config['image_size'],patch_size=16), losses.Grad('l2').loss]\r\nloss_weights = [1.0 2.0]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/208/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
