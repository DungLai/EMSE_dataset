Now, using the saved weight, I tried to register the two images (register.py is used) but got the following error. I'm assuming it may be linked to how the semi-supervised model was saved? I would really appreciate it if you guys can take a quick look. Registration runs just fine with unsupervised trained .h files. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1589\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74314232/166194879-f6e55aa2-4482-407a-b25c-ae458a9e6de8.png\">\r\n\r\n(II) Also, I had trouble using the bw_grid() function to warp a grid - grid looks just fine before warping but seems very weird after warping. (III) Also, do we necessarily have to see convergence in all losses during training? i.e. val_vxm_dense_flow_resize_loss) \r\n\r\nThank you for developing and maintaining such a wonderful project, allowing undergrads like myself to learn and work on meaningful biomedical projects.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
