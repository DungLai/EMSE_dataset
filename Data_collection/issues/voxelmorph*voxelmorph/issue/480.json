One of the reasons is the artifacts formed outside warped image - for more details please refer [previous issue](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/468) This could be because of the global misalignment between the volumes. Vocelmorph paper mentions that the voxelmorph assumes the global/affine alignment between volumes, in the case of CHAOS dataset there seems some rigid misalignment.
