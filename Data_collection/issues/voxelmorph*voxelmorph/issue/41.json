In the readme you mentioned that is unsupervised - _\"Unsupervised Learning with CNNs for Image Registration\"_ and later there is a training phase (after setup), so I become confused... If training with annotation is needed, would it work with a landmark annotation such as [ANHIR](https://anhir.grand-challenge.org)?","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
