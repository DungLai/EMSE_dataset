I am not able to get a nice grid anymore and I am also not sure about the correctness of the implementation. \r\nYou recently added a thickness parameter but I think the thickness should be taken into account also in this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/adalca/pytools-lib/blob/7013bcc40b686bf94eb5bd2f2de2793cc1711660/pynd/ndutils.py#L134\r\nand in line:\r\nhttps://github.com/adalca/pytools-lib/blob/7013bcc40b686bf94eb5bd2f2de2793cc1711660/pynd/ndutils.py#L135\r\nthere is a warning about deprecation that I guess could be solved by using tuple() for indexing.\r\n\r\nThis is a small example:\r\n`grid_img = bw_grid((128, 256, 512), 10)\r\nplt.imshow(grid_img[55, :, :], cmap='gray')`\r\n![example1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6599726/81430463-bc94a400-915f-11ea-9dd7-a0e8f609d8d8.png)\r\n\r\n`grid_img = bw_grid((128, 256, 512), 10)\r\nplt.imshow(grid_img[: , 55, :], cmap='gray')`\r\n![example2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6599726/81430518-d635eb80-915f-11ea-9dd1-f9d8a850ae61.png)\r\n\r\n`grid_img = bw_grid((128, 256, 512), 10)\r\nplt.imshow(grid_img[: , :, 55], cmap='gray')`\r\n![example3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6599726/81430588-f1086000-915f-11ea-80d5-31835ce9aeb6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
