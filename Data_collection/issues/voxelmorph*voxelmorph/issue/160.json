I really appreciate it!!  \r\nSo, I have successfully trained a network in Voxelmorph and would like to validate my registration using label comparison statistics (such as Dice, etc.).  I am able to pass two CT volumes into the network and get a good looking registered CT.  However, if I apply this corresponding warp field to a label map of the source CT's segmentations the boundaries of each label become mixed in values. With these mixed values I cannot use the label comparison methods.  \r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nI used the nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer with nearest interpolation.  However there still appears to be some interpolation occurring on the boundaries.\r\n\r\ncode used:\r\n\r\n**y_seg = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='nearest', indexing=indexing)([src_seg, flow])**\r\n\r\n-y_seg is the resulting deformed segmentation label map\r\n-indexing is set to 'ij'\r\n-src_seg is the original source undeformed segmentation label map\r\n-flow is the flow field output from the Voxelmorph network.\r\n\r\n\r\nexample of output:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28455475/75955616-1aa8c080-5e6b-11ea-8d8e-d4012fa9d4e1.png)\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\n\r\nI have dug through the source code a bit trying to see where the interpolation was occurring and if it was somehow possible for me to fix, however after several hours of searching I decided to post here and ask for help.  I'm not sure if you have seen this happen?  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n-E\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emckenzi123","id":28455475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDU1NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28455475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123","html_url":"https://github.com/emckenzi123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emckenzi123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
