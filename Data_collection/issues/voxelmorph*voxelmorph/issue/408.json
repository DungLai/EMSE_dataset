I have met some questions.\r\n**Task** (what are you trying to do/register?)\r\n\r\nI'm using my own data about abdominal CT. I want to registerdifferent ct images of the same patient to account for positional changes caused by respiration. But the result seems the same to the original image.\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nI have already change the data in range(0,1).with mse loss , I use the default model and train 450 epoch.\r\nthe loss result are follows:\r\n loss: 0.0012 - transformer_loss: 9.8923e-04 - flow_resize_loss: 0.0181\r\n\r\nthe input and output are as follows:\r\n\r\nthe moving image\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55624370/160268637-1bea5a83-3fae-4fae-82ca-79edd5e37c65.png)\r\nthe fixed image\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55624370/160268646-4144dd61-75f4-4d75-90d2-1057a5d18159.png)\r\nthe result\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55624370/160268654-38dc57b7-faa0-4aec-802a-5027a55c83ba.png)\r\n\r\nyou can see that the result looks same to the moving image(such as in the red box).\r\n\r\nhope for your help.thank you!","closed_by":{"login":"sun-sc","id":55624370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjI0Mzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55624370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc","html_url":"https://github.com/sun-sc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-sc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
