I need to find the points to which the landmarks are transformed to after deformation. If the landmark is located at position _(x, y, z)_ in image **I** and the image is transformed to image **I'** after deformation, I need to compute the location in **I'** to which _(x, y,z)_ is mapped to. I guess **neg_flow** can be used but am not exactly sure how the location can be computed efficiently.
