I am trying to train a conditional template vxm model on the MNIST dataset. I only have one attribute, namely, 0-9 classes. But the generated templates look very strange. As I understand, the trained model suppose to generate ten templates(0-9 digital images). \r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\nFirst, I set:steps_per_epoch=100, since it is given in the demo. And the epoch is set to 1500. The loss weights are set to  γ = 0:01, λd = 0:001, λa = 0:01, and σ = 1, which is given in paper. When the model is trained, I first build the model by model = vxm.networks.ConditionalTemplateCreation(), then load weights by: model.load_weights('1500.h'). Then I extract the model between the input and atlas layer. I input 0~9 into this network and visualize the output. The output is very strange; since only 0 is correctly generated, all others just look like number 3(But there is a little difference between them).\r\n\r\nThen I found that steps_per_epoch should be set to x_train.shape[0] // args.batch_size. So I retrain the model and use tensorboard to visualize the output of layer 'atlas', but the same problem exsits.\r\n\r\nCould you tell me what I did wrong? I am so confused.\r\n\r\nHere is the outputs of layers 'atlas_gen' and 'atlas' (from 0-9)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31833999/110079523-8036d200-7d89-11eb-88ec-728fa9c36502.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Fjr9516","id":31833999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODMzOTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31833999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516","html_url":"https://github.com/Fjr9516","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fjr9516/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
