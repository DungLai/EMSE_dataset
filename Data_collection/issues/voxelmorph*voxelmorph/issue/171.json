I am not sure where is the code this is happening. I have added these:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nos.environ[\"OMP_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\"\r\nos.environ[\"OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\" \r\nos.environ[\"MKL_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\" \r\nos.environ[\"VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\"\r\nos.environ[\"NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the system still jumps up to take all CPU threads available.
