(GPU: RTX 3090, 24GB memory)\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nI used ```voxelmorph/scripts/train.py``` to obtain the scan-to-scan deformation field model\r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\n\r\nThe CT scans I used are in high resolution which are 512x512x(# of slices). If I did not downsample the scans and start training directly, the GPU memory will run out of. However, if I used ```Scipy``` to pad and downsample images to 256x256x128, the training result was very bad. Can anyone help me solve this issue and provide me some suggestions?
