This can be quite limiting for registration of large 3D images. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I was wondering if you have encountered these resource-usage issues when using PyTorch models and if you are aware of any potential discrepancies between the TF and PyTorch model architectures that may result in differences in the computing resources required (using CPUs) for registration of similar images. \r\n\r\nThank you !","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
