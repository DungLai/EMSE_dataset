Of course, it is one of best loss functions for multi-modal registration, and I know you have implemented a vectorized differentiable version. Please let us know about its time and space complexity to help selecting proper batch-size based on the amount of memory in the system or GPU. It is appreciated if you could open up the issue with some simple examples.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and energy.
