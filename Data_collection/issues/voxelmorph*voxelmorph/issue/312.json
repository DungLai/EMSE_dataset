After producing the affine parameters in the shape of (?,6) by the network, I want to use affine_to_shift() function implemented in the neuron.utiles to produce the displacement filed and submit it to the SpatialTransformer() layer. It produces some opportunities for me instead of sending the affine parameters directly to the SpatialTransformer() layer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found that the affine_to_shift() function implemented in the neuron.utiles does not support batch data processing i.e. it gets affine parameters in the shape of (6,) instead of (?,6) needed for batch processing.\r\n\r\nIt is appreciated if you could tell me how I can fix the problem. Another question is that: Is this function (affine_to_shift) differentiable i.e. Could I exploit it in the model?\r\n\r\nI am using the voxelmorph based on TensorFlow v1.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and energy.\r\nRegards,\r\n- Hamidreza    ","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
