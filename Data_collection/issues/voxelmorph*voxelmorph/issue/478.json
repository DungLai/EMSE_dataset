Thank you for providing this as an open source project. \r\n\r\nI was attempting to run the shapes file on some of my own data. Each of the shapes are sized (200, 200) as numpy files, and don't have batch nor channel dims. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, I ran into the following error message. I was curious if this is resolved potentially perhaps resizing? \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6611182/193337199-af1730ef-feaa-47a9-9e16-d7959f5705b7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem info is provided below (and more than happy to provide further information as well):\r\n\r\nMacOs: 12.6 (Intel Core i9)\r\npython version: Python 3.10.5\r\n\r\n\r\ntensorflow==2.9.1\r\nkeras==2.9.0\r\nnumpy==1.12.1\r\nvoxelmorph==0.2\r\nneurite==0.2","closed_by":{"login":"KBlansit","id":6611182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTExODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6611182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit","html_url":"https://github.com/KBlansit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
