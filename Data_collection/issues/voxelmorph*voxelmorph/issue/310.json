I wanted to replace this with the KL loss function. However, I am getting the following error:\r\n\r\n> TypeError: An op outside of the function building code is being passed a \"Graph\" tensor. It is possible to have Graph tensors\r\nleak out of the function building context by including a tf.init_scope in your function building code. For example, the following function will fail:\r\n  @tf.function\r\n  def has_init_scope():\r\n    my_constant = tf.constant(1.)\r\n    with tf.init_scope():\r\n      added = my_constant * 2\r\nThe graph tensor has name: loss_1/Conv3D:0\r\n\r\nI am assuming that I am just doing something wrong in my code, but I don't understand what it would be and the error is very nondescript so any help would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n**What have I tried**\r\nTo test the problem, I have tried to see if I can get the loss function to work on a toy registration problem with just one scan.\r\nHere is the basic `vxm` code:\r\n```\r\nlosses = [vxm.losses.NCC().loss]\r\nweights = [1.]\r\nlosses += [KL(prior_lambda=25, flow_vol_shape=vol_shape).loss]\r\nweights += [1.]\r\n\r\nmodel = vxm.networks.VxmDense(shpe, nb_features, int_steps=7, int_downsize=1, use_probs=True)\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=lr), loss=losses, loss_weights=weights)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe loss calculation works through if I do the following: \r\n```\r\ninput, output = next(dataloader)\r\npred = model.predict(input)\r\n\r\ny_true = tf.convert_to_tensor(output[1])\r\ny_pred = tf.convert_to_tensor(pred[1])\r\nprint(KL(prior_lambda=prior_lambda, flow_vol_shape=flow_vol_shape).loss(y_true, y_pred))\r\n```\r\nwhich returns a normal output, e.g. `tf.Tensor(15.010109, shape=(), dtype=float32)`;\r\nbut then in the actual training with `model.fit()`, I run into the aforementioned error. \r\n\r\n**Details of experiments**\r\nI am currently using the `dev` branch, as in the `master` branch I could not get the `use_probs` argument to work, and also [some other features](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/discussions/306). From a quick scan it seems that the KL loss has not been changed between the branches. \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
