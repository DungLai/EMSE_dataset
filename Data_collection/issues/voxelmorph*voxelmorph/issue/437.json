I would like to use it to register 2D skin images, which are in .tiff format, however, I don't know what would be the correct conversion format or if I would have to make any changes to the code. \r\n\r\nIn case the code is not available for use in 2D images, I would like to know if you have any recommendation of paper or research to do it please.\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance:)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
