I'm a bit confused, regarding the need to create a _sampling grid_ that is applied to an image to morph/warp it.  Why is not possible to apply a geometric transform directly to an image; in other words, why go through the trouble of creating a sampling grid?\r\n\r\nAny insight would be appreciated.
