So when we try to run the scripts, it has some errors. Also, we have a question about the model settings. When we create a model and our template shape is (1, 512, 512, 129), when we call model.set_atlas(template), it gives an error that the dimension of layer wights is not same to the template dimension (512,512,129).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1167\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-08 at 19 15 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70731556/153097682-c147798a-1f5f-4645-9f99-c51d4be6e4ff.png\">\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
