I've started to read Voxelmorph-related papers and I'm excited about the project.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether I find the right place to report something about papers, but I hope it will reach to you somehow.\r\n\r\nCaption for Table 1, Voxelmorph-dff description comes with\r\n\"while also having nearly zero **non-negative** Jacobian locations\". For me, zero **non-positive** Jacobian locations makes more sense and matches with the Table 1. Is it still true statement, \"while also having nearly zero **non-negative** Jacobian locations\"?\r\n\r\nIf it is, would you mind to explain it to me?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Joeycho","id":29337166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzM3MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29337166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho","html_url":"https://github.com/Joeycho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joeycho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
