I mean I do not know, how to load the .npz file in this folder when I train.\r\nFor example, which .npz file is Moving image or Fixed image, respectively?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37217354/135755824-29539a50-53a4-43e2-90b8-a093ec59c331.png)\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tphankr","id":37217354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjE3MzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37217354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr","html_url":"https://github.com/tphankr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
