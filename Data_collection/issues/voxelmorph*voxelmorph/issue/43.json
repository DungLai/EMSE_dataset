I use Colin27 volumes as my atlas and ADNI volumes as the subject images. The maximum intensity of the Colin27 volumes is about 0.62 and that of the ADNI volumes is about 0.86 after intensity normalization to [0,1] by simply using “ img = img/255 ” and the minimum intensity for both is 0. \r\n\r\nThe model I am using is your miccai voxelmorph, and the prior_lambda is 15, the image_sigma is 0.02, batch size is 1, the rest of parameters are as default. I find that no matter how I change the two sigma and lambda parameters, the loss values are no less than 8 during training process. I use the trained model to generate deformation field, and then use the deformation field to warp the Colin volume, I find that the warped images are all blurred, I don’t know the specific reason for that. I really appreciate that if you can help me with that, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n-Shuo","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
