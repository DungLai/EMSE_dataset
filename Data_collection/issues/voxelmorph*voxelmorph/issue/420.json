If you used synthesized images, then did you fix seed numbers for the label_to_image generator to consistently generate same images among epochs?\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your great work!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nohsoocheol","id":96034069,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbldFQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96034069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol","html_url":"https://github.com/nohsoocheol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nohsoocheol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
