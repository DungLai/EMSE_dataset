I trained the conditional template generation model using train_cond_template.py for 1500 epochs (default). The output of the model training was '.h5' files of the parameters, saved every 20 epochs. I used the final model file '1500.h5' to generate templates based on specific values of attributes. The atlases look decent, though a little blurred and similar to each other (may require some parameter tuning). Now, I am looking to register a new test image with the generated atlas. How can I extract the registration model and use it to register? Any pointers/code to do this would be helpful.\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"keshavak","id":32077076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDc3MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32077076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak","html_url":"https://github.com/keshavak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keshavak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/421/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
