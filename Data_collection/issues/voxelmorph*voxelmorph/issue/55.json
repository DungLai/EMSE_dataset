I am new to this field.\r\nI have some low-level questions as below that I could not find any answer on the internet.\r\n\r\n1. When training, input image pair is the same person of the same brain MRI pair ?\r\nWhat I mean and am confused is that \r\n(fix one person brain, moving the same person brain) >>> next (fix one person brain, moving the same person brain)\r\nor\r\n(fix one person brain, moving the same person brain) >>> next (fix one person brain, moving the same person brain but different image and same scan machine)\r\nor\r\n(fix one person brain, moving the same person brain) >>> next (fix one person brain, moving the same person brain but different image via different scan machine)\r\nor\r\n(fix one person brain, moving the same person brain) >>> next (fix one person brain, moving the another person brain with/without the same scan machine)\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Now I have 2D color image need to do image registration.\r\nHow should I do ?\r\nShould I just input single 2D color for training.\r\nOr preprocess 2D color to gray color ? Or compact all color or gray image to volume size for training?\r\n\r\nAny idea and suggestion would be appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
