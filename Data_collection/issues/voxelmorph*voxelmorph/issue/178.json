I tried the NCC loss function, with default hyperparams (window of 9, eps of 1e-5). \r\n\r\nRandomly during training, the loss goes to -inf, and the execution stops with InvalidInputArgument and saying that the matrix is not invertible. \r\n\r\nIt does happen randomly, so it is difficult for me to reproduce the code. I tried a couple of things, like checking the input data, just running train_on_batch with that specific batch where it fails, try to check the output after the error was thrown as so on. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that I cannot really figure out there in the code an inf is generated. \r\n`cc = cross * cross / (I_var * J_var + self.eps)`\r\nThere is a eps on the denominator of the loss function, so it cannot be a division by zero. It must be from the numerator, but then that has to be inf. Given that cross is computed via \r\n`cross = IJ_sum - u_J*I_sum - u_I*J_sum + u_I*u_J*win_size`\r\none of the term has to be inf. There is where I got stuck cuz, given that these terms are either convs activation maps or hyperparams, there is no way these can generate inf. \r\n\r\nAnyone with the same problem? any clue why?","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
