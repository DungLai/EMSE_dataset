I am getting very good results however, prior to registration using synthmorph I need to affinely align the thermal images. Now due to the nature of the thermal images which I have, the affine transformation pre-processing step is non-trivial and very difficult. I would like to automate the whole process including the affine transform and I came to the conclusion that the easiest and neatest way to do this would be to include the affine transformation in the synthmorph network. I am lost as to which part of the code I need to edit to do this if it is even possible.
