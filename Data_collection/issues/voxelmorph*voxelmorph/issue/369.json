I am looking to build a conditional template using train_cond_template.py. I am a little unclear on how to specify data attributes such as gender, disease state. For e.g., in function load_pheno_csv(), it says \"each attr is a floating point number\". Do we just assign some number to gender and disease state, which are categorical variables?  \r\n\r\nThank you!
