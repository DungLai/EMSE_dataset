For the shape of 3T MRI image is [256,176,256] and the shape of 7T MRI image is [310,314,208], that is to say, 3T MRI image has 256 slices and 7T MRI image has 208 slices. If I want to train a model to register 3T MRI image to 7T MRI image, what should I do first to prepare my dataset? I am a novice in this area, any suggestions are welcome.
