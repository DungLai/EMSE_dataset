I am attempting to make use of the dice loss function in pytorch.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, why is the definition of the loss function under the `Dice` class different from that of which is found in`utils.py`?  The latter makes use of labels, whereas the former does not.  Why is this so?\r\n![dice_in_loss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70844260/95660033-7f28ae00-0b25-11eb-86fb-994589134e8d.PNG)\r\n\r\n![dice_in_utils](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70844260/95660034-8059db00-0b25-11eb-9947-ac35e33f6a35.PNG)\r\n\r\nSecondly, my current progress is as follows: I made some rough segmentations of my region of interest.  They are images of size: 256x256.  Does the 'label' refer to the pixel value of the segmentations?  I ask this because of how the of how the `dice` function is defined (with the use of logical ands).  If so, would this mean that my segmentations should be of a single pixel value in order to make use of the dice function?  Thank you in advance. \r\n\r\nI attached my segmented image below\r\n\r\n![segmentation(top)_corresponding_image(bottom)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70844260/95660036-80f27180-0b25-11eb-8864-8e571ac7a45b.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
