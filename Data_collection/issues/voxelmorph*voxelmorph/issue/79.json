Recently, I am working on the stationary velocity field integration method, I notice that you mentioned 3 methods, including scaling and squaring, quadrature and ode. Is the quadrature method the forward Euler method? Because it seems like they have similar integration process, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nAnd you mentioned the inverse-consistency error of the forward and the inverse deformations, I want to know how to compute it, does your code give that part? Is the composition of the two deformations the same with that of the scaling and squaring method? If they are the same composition, then I know where the find the code, it is the 'transform' part of the integrate_vec. \r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n   ","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
