This maybe ambiguous when performing image transform in other software like Slicer 3D/ITK. \r\n\r\nAlso the warp field is stored as 4D image instead of 3D vector image. SimpleITK only accepts vector pixels for displacement field transformation.\r\n\r\n# **What have you tried**\r\n\r\nI am much familiar with SimpleITK while VXM using nibabel as the backend. I use the following code to convert the voxelmorph warp field to the one comparable with ANTs SyN output.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n# convert voxelmorph field to vector image\r\nwarp_np = sitk.GetArrayFromImage(warp).astype(np.float64)\r\nwarp_ = sitk.GetImageFromArray(np.moveaxis(warp_np,0,-1), isVector=True)\r\nwarp_.SetOrigin(warp.GetOrigin())\r\nnew_dir = [warp.GetDirection()[int(4*np.floor(i/3)+i%3)] for i in range(9)]\r\nwarp_.SetDirection(new_dir)\r\nwarp_.SetSpacing(moving.GetSpacing())\r\nwarp = warp_\r\n\r\n# note that transformation field is in direction of NIFTI coordinate (RAS), ITK coordinate system use RAI direction by default. Here for coding convenience we use ITK system.\r\n# please note that voxelmorph export warp field in ijk coordinate, need to rescale back to real space\r\n# warp field from moving to fixed space should be scaling of spacing then translate by difference in image origin\r\nscaling = [warp.GetSpacing()[i] for i in range(warp.GetNumberOfComponentsPerPixel())]\r\nwarp_ = sitk.Compose([sitk.VectorIndexSelectionCast(warp,i)*scaling[i] + (moving.GetOrigin()[i]-fixed.GetOrigin()[i]) for i in range(warp.GetNumberOfComponentsPerPixel())])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if the voxelmorph should change the warp field output to XYZ coordinate (or add an option for this). Image directions may also need to consider during the conversion.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
