I downloaded your dataset from here: https://github.com/adalca/medical-datasets/blob/master/neurite-oasis.md. 314 data were used for training and 100 data were used for testing. However, when I train the model, it always shows the ’Resource exhausted: OOM’ error.\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\nFirst, I tried to reduce the batch size to 1, but OOM still exists. \r\nThen, I tried to use distributed training, using two GPUs for training. (Batch size should be a multiple of the number of GPUs, so I just set it to the number of GPUs). But OOM still exists.\r\n\r\nI used two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 11GB,  computeCapability: 6.1\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what GPUs you used to successfully train the model? Or do you have any suggestions for me to train this model on my machine?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
