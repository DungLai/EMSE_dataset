In the TMI paper (extention of cvpr 2018), you said that\r\n> We also assume that f and m are affinely aligned as a preprocessing step, so that the only source of misalignment between the volumes is nonlinear\r\n\r\nDoes it mean \"affinely aligned\" or rigid aligned\"?\r\n\r\nI am asking it because the affine transform requires 12 dof (for 3D: rotation+translation+scaling), while the rigid align requires 6 dof [source: [flirt](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT/UserGuide)]\r\n\r\n>Restrict the transformation type. For 3D to 3D mode the DOF can be set to 12 (affine), 9 (traditional), 7 (global rescale) or 6 (rigid body).\r\n\r\nSo, if we register a subject to the atlas by affine transform, normally the shape of the subject brain will be scaled to be similar to atlas brain. While the rigid transform will maintain the shape/size of brain subject.\r\n\r\nThe second question I want to ask is that, do you think the normalization range is importance? How about the other range such as [-1,1] or even zero mean and unit variance.\r\n\r\nThe third question is that interpolation method. For given a displacement field, it is clear that we should use nearness interpolation for making a warped label. However, for the moved image, do you think bilinear or nearness which one is better? In my testing, I found that the bilinear often smooth the intensity (also constant between tissues), while the nearness can ignore it but it has some artifact in the boundary (likes zigzag artifact)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
