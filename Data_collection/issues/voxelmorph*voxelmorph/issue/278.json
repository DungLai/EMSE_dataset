Then to test the predictions, I ran the \"vxm_model.predict()\" on my validation data of list length 2.\r\nStructure of the list passed in predict(): [(1, 288, 288, 96, 1), (1, 288, 288, 96, 1)]\r\n\r\nThen as the tutorial suggests I saved the outputs in the following fashion:\r\nmoved_pred = val_pred[0].squeeze()\r\npred_warp = val_pred[1]\r\n\r\nFor \"moved_pred\" I was able to generate images from the predicted numpy array but for **pred_warp** I'm getting the numpy array with **only 0s** in them.\r\nsimply put : pred_warp = val_pred[1] = 0\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.
