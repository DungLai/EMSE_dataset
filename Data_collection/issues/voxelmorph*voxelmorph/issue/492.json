In \"SpatialTransformer\" you reverse the order of the (grid) channels:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-23 16-27-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29921239/203584744-1aa27906-33b2-4640-a98f-a69032d4e65a.png)\r\n\r\nI got the point, that this is because of the function \"torch.nn.functional.grid_sample\", where this is required.\r\n\r\nFrom this I assume the following: \r\n\"torch.nn.functional.grid_sample\" expects the grid to have shape (N, D, H, W, 3) = (N, D, H, W, [d, w, h]). So this then means, that the flow originally has shape (N, [h, w, d], D, H, W). \r\n\r\nIs this assumption correct? \r\n(This information is important to me, since I am transforming points and need to make sure to have the appropriate shape.)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
