this is correct. Sorry for the confusion. I've updated the README with new instructions.\r\n\r\nBasically, you'll need some file that lists the unique image filenames in your training dataset. This doesn't necessarily have to include the full paths though, as you can use the `--img-prefix` and `--img-suffix` flags to add information. For example, in the OASIS dataset that Adrian linked, you can use `subjects.txt` (included in the dataset) as your file list, and use `--img-prefix /path/to/downloaded/dataset/` and `--img-suffix /norm.nii.gz` to specify where the data is stored and which image file to use from the subject folders.\r\n\r\nFrom the updated README:\r\n\r\n>  For a given image list file `/images/list.txt` and output directory `/models/output`, the following script will train an image-to-image registration network (described in MICCAI 2018 by default) with an unsupervised loss. Model weights will be saved to a path specified by the `--model-dir` flag.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ./scripts/tf/train.py --img-list /images/list.txt --model-dir /models/output --gpu 0\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n>
