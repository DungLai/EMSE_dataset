We currently default to `npz` files because this iss what we used in our experiments. We have a line in the training file: `train_vol_names = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_dir, '*.npz'))`. If you have nifti files, you would need to change this use `*.nii` instead of `*.npz`.\r\n3. We tested voxelmorph on affinely-registered, normalized and cropped images, but of course it always depends on the data.

works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/477625462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2236512670,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIzNjUxMjY3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2236512670","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-28T14:43:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2236512675,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIzNjUxMjY3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2236512675","actor":{"login":"zzx332","id":45729525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzI5NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45729525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332","html_url":"https://github.com/zzx332","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-28T14:43:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2236512677,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMzY1MTI2Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2236512677","actor":{"login":"zzx332","id":45729525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzI5NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45729525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332","html_url":"https://github.com/zzx332","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzx332/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-28T14:43:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/477892267","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/29#issuecomment-477892267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/29","id":477892267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzg5MjI2Nw==","user":{"log

Yes, voxelmorph is meant for registration (alignment). You can use VoxelMorph to learn to register images to an atlas, or image-to-image as well.

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/4900\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/517268153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/517300132","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/29#issuecomment-517300132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/29","id":517300132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzMwMDEzMg==","user":{"login":"qiheihelan","id":52766070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzY2MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52766070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan","html_url":"https://github.com/qiheihelan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T13:59:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T13:59:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@adalca\r\nHi.\r\nI running on a GPU and  tf version is 1.13.1.\r\n When I feed the two images you provided as a pair of inputs (e.g. atlas_nomal.nii as moving image,and its duplicate as fixed), the program works fine. But when I feed my own two image, an error occurs. So it may still be because the image is not processed correctly.\r\nso，venture to ask a question, could I  send two images I processed to your mailbox. Could you help me see what is wrong?  \r\nThank you very much for your continued help. I will continue to improve and strive to get my results as soon as possible.\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/517300132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"qiheihelan","id":52766070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzY2MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52766070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan","html_url":"https://github.com/qiheihelan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2526668598,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUyNjY2ODU5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2526668598","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T13:59:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2526668599,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MjY2Njg1OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2526668599","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T13:59:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
