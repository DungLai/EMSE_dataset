In the course of our registration work more broadly, we ran pretty thorough searches over parameters, and included these in the papers. For example, bottom of page 7 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05231.pdf. The same with NiftyReg -- we made only tiny modifications to the default parameters to improve accuracy a bit. For example in the linked pdf, we only modified the cost function (CC instead of NMI) grid spacing of 5, and 500 iterations. \r\n\r\n> if the script for generating NiftyReg registrations could be shared as well\r\n\r\nWe have several registration publications where we may have tuned niftyReg differently depending on the task -- for example in multi-modal registration @mu40 used default NiftyReg parameters because those seemed to work well for that task (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10282.pdf). In terms of running, i think just something like \r\n\r\n```reg_f3d -ref atlas.nii -flo vol.nii -res result.nii -cpp result_cpp.nii``` or `reg_aladin ` as appropriate, see
