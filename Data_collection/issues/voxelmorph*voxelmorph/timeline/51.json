I agree, it looks like the field is not regularized enough. Since it's a very different problem from the brain MRIs we worked on, this is not surprising. There's a couple of things you can do, the simplest being to increase the regularization penalty. The second would be to make the field diffeomorphic, which would simply involve adding a call to the `VecInt` layer after the `flow` layer is created in the cvpr network.\r\n\r\n2. I would assume this is related to #1 as the field is probably trying hard to fit other features and sometimes will kill some aspects by squishing them too much. It might help to visualize the deformation fields themselves (as images, to start)\r\n\r\n3. The default model will give you the displacement field in the target (fixed) space as the second output. This means that you can take the landmarks in the fixed (second) space and warp them to the moving (first) image easily -- (a) you can simply use scipy's `interpn` to get the displacement values *at* the locations of your \"fixed\" landmarks, (b) add this displacement do their  location, (c) compare with the landmarks in the 'moving' space. \r\n\r\nWe have tensorflow code that warps points with a given flow that I am happy to share (it would be more efficient than numpy and you could do it directly when running a network), but I warn you that this hasn't been tested thoroughly and we're only using it internally for now. Or you can build your own tensorflow version using the `interpn` in https://github.com/adalca/neuron/blob/master/neuron/utils.py.

this goes much deeper than voxelmorph, but basically we use NCC when the relationship of anatomical intensities between the two images is monotonic. So if structure A is \"darker\" than structure B in scan 1, it's also darker in scan 2. For example, you might use this in T1 to T1 registration when you have a lot of noise of you haven't normalized the T1s. We use MSE when these intensities are the *same* modulo noise (e.g. in cleanly normalized T1 to T1). Mutual information of intensities has no such requirement, and you could use it between modalities (E.g.
