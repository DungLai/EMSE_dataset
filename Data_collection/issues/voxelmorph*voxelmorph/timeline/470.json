I am confused that after you creating the conditional template based on age, for example, how do you examine the quality of your created conditional template? after I read the paper, I think it is based on dice score, but it requres the segmentation map, so that is why I want to know how to get the segmentation map and how to quantitively examine the created conditional atlas. \r\n\r\nMany

the atlas using phi --> this gives you warped seg map\r\n> \r\n> Then take the average over the 10 one-hot warped segmentation maps (you could weight these by the age difference between the subject and the atlas.\r\n\r\nHi thanks for replying me, I just wonder how to take the average? using ants tool or just simply using python code to average it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1238910013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bingcheg","id":69607047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjA3MDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69607047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg","html_url":"https://github.com/bingcheg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bingcheg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1239313973","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/470#issuecomment-1239313973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/470","id":1239313973,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285J3m41","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T12:17:47Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T12:17:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"python
