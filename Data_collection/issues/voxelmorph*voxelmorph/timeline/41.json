There *is* a training phase, and a loss function, but this training and loss do not use any annotations, rather they measure the 'goodness' of the deformation produced by the network by checking if warping the first image with this deformation gives you the second image (plus some regularization).\r\n\r\nThis is described in more details in our papers, see for example: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05231\r\n\r\nIf you happen to have landmarks during training, you can optionally use them (the paper above describes the concept behind this as well), but you don't *need* annotations to train.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489368196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2319264061,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMxOTI2NDA2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319264061","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:47:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319264062,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxOTI2NDA2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319264062","actor":{"login":"Borda","id":6035284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6035284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda","html_url":"https://github.com/Borda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:47:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319264063,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTkyNjQwNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319264063","actor":{"login":"Borda","id":6035284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6035284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda","html_url":"https://github.com/Borda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:47:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319264454,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMTkyNjQ0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319264454","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","h
