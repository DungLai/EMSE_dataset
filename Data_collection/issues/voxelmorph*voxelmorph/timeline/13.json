interesting, seems like it's right, although I'm quite unclear as to why your data is [56, 56, 56] \r\n\r\nis that two slices of your data, or your data next to the atlas? \r\nIt would be good to see your data next to the atlas, and also with colorbars, especially since there seems to be a size issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/455803227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/455803564","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/13#issuecomment-455803564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/13","id":455803564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTgwMzU2NA==","user":{"login":"yellowgardenia","id":19528651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTI4NjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19528651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia","html_url":"https://github.com/yellowgardenia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellowgardenia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-19T18:24:32Z","updated_at":"2019-01-19T18:24:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The
