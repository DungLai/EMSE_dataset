These are, essentially, the velocity field mean and the uncertainty (standard deviation) around that. Since both are 3D, together they are 6 channels. The reason they are half the size is because we estimate them at every 2 voxels (for memory limitations).\r\n\r\nTo get the displacement field, you can look at how we deal with it in `test_miccai2018.py`. Specifically, you can use \r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff_net = keras.models.Model(net.inputs, net.get_layer('diffflow').output)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere net is your `miccai2018_net`. The output of this new model is the deformation field only. Does this make sense?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/552446676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2787946352,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc4Nzk0NjM1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2787946352","actor":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T13:31:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2787946353,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3ODc5NDYzNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2787946353","actor":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T13:31:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2787948278,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3ODc5NDgyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2787948278","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-11T13:32:11Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/552780960","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/122#issuecomment-552780960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues
