With reference to previous pytorch code (https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/pull/145/commits/389274436263ef0cd9a32a566f12bf7f048f6843), and modified to tf version. MIND has been successfully used in CT-MR. Because it is head and neck data, the deformation is relatively small, but MR data is incomplete (the slice number is very small), so it relies heavily on rigid registration.\r\nHowever, the known loss function is not applicable to multi-mode rigid registration, especially for large rigid displacement. Therefore, I returned to the traditional optimization algorithm and now the registration has been completed.\r\nThanks to Voxelmorph for helping me solve the actual clinical problems, I hope it will become more perfect ~\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/713387173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shchojj","id":7993631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj","html_url":"https://github.com/shchojj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shchojj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3902464449,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkwMjQ2NDQ0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3902464449","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T08:02:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3902464452,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MDI0NjQ0NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3902464452","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T08:02:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
