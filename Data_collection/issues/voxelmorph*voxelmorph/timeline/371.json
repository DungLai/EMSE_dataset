I used the [ParamsToAffineMatrix](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/f14939a6db68e14b0e1b1fefe4b97ce90852809e/voxelmorph/tf/layers.py#L447) layer to convert a dense layer to an affine matrix. I noticed that it expects inputs of translations first, then rotations. So a 45 degree rotation on the y-z plane would be something like 0, 0, 0, 45, 0, 0. \r\n\r\nThen I sent this to the [AffineToDenseShift](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/f14939a6db68e14b0e1b1fefe4b97ce90852809e/voxelmorph/tf/layers.py#L502) layer. The output of this works together with the [SpatialTransformer](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/f14939a6db68e14b0e1b1fefe4b97ce90852809e/voxelmorph/tf/layers.py#L34) layer. \r\n\r\nSo in the output of my model, I received the transformed image from the SpatialTransformer layer, and the six parameters (translations and rotations) that are sent to ParamsToAffineMatrix layer.\r\n\r\nI hope that this made sense, and that it could help you with your experiment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1004337318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thomasediolausson","id":90185739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTg1NzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90185739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasediolausson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasediolausson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1181262139","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/371#issuecomment-1181262139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/371","id":1181262139,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285GaKE7","user":{"login":"dfvr1994","id":45764991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzY0OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45764991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994","html_url":"https://github.com/dfvr1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dfvr1994/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T03:05:53Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T03:05:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @thomasediolausson , mind sharing the code used to such approach?
