Using standard processing, using freesufer affine alignment and normalizing to 0-1.\r\nI used a variety of hyperparameter settings during training.mse: (lambda=0.01,lambda_weight=10,image_sigma=0.02).NCC(lambda=1,lambda_weight=25,image_sigma=0.02) and so on.use_prob=True.int_step=7.\r\n\r\nI am using the latest version of the code downloaded from the official website.\r\nI used a variety of hyperparameter settings during training. But Dice always drops to around 0.41. I don't know where the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/895676486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SLKaMiHi","id":73085198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDg1MTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73085198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi","html_url":"https://github.com/SLKaMiHi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5132914962,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTEzMjkxNDk2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5132914962","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-10T02:17:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5132914964,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxMzI5MTQ5NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5132914964","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-10T02:17:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
