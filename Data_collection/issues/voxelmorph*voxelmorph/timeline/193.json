We've been hard at work on releasing a new version of VoxelMorph, which we've now launched on our Master branch.\r\n\r\nDid you manage to get this to work? Affine registration is a bit tricky -- you can design one of many simple encoder networks to predict the affine parameters, and it often works, but as you say may not generalize well. In the last month we've really been pushing this and have developed a couple of much more elegant/cleaner networks, but have not quite yet released them. I expect we'll release them soon, though.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, how have your results been?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/678528495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3681235410,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY4MTIzNTQxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3681235410","actor":{"login":"ludles","id":37469405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDY5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37469405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles","html_url":"https://github.com/ludles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-21T21:40:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3681235411,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2ODEyMzU0MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3681235411","actor":{"login":"ludles","id":37469405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDY5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37469405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles","html_url":"https://github.com/ludles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-21T21:40:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/680707671","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/193#issuecomment-680707671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/193","id":680707671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDcwNzY3MQ==","user":{"login":"ludles","id":37469405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDY5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37469405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles","html_url":"https://github.com/ludles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ludles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T07:23:13Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T07:23:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your reply! \r\n\r\nI still haven't got it working as expected.
