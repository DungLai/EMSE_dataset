We recommend using the larger network designs for this (e.g. double the numbers in `nf_enc` and `nf_dec`).\r\n\r\nYou can also use voxelmorph to register between modalities (like `t1` to `t2`) -- simple change the cost function to mutual information.\r\n\r\nIn short, to answer your question, voxelmorph can definitely be used to do scan-to-scan, it does not have to be only for scan-to-atlas.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/525561017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2589050797,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU4OTA1MDc5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2589050797","actor":{"login":"John1231983","id":24875971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODc1OTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24875971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983","html_url":"https://github.com/John1231983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T02:46:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2589050798,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1ODkwNTA3OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2589050798","actor":{"login":"John1231983","id":24875971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODc1OTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24875971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983","html_url":"https://github.com/John1231983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T02:46:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2589050893,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1ODkwNTA4OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2589050893","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T02:46:29Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2589051098,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU4OTA1MTA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2589051098","actor":{"logi
