worries, I managed to get it working in the meantime. As for the first problem, I found out that I had previously installed a different pytools package from a different project. Simply uninstalling that one solved the problem. \r\n\r\nFor the second problem I couldn't find the culprit, so I ended up just adding the \\src directory to the python path and `import networks` directly. Perhaps not the most pythonic way but it works fine for now.
