@John1231983 yup this sounds good to me -- at training, you can just load the weights into a model that's the full size.\r\n\r\nI would be careful about training with patches, since having the correct deformation at the edges of the images is hard in that case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/527970377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2607597844,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwNzU5Nzg0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2607597844","actor":{"login":"jeanyves-yang","id":8050762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTA3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8050762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeanyves-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-04T16:05:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2607597848,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDc1OTc4NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2607597848","actor":{"login":"jeanyves-yang","id":8050762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTA3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8050762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeanyves-yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanyves-yang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-04T16:05:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2607597849,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwNzU5Nzg0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2607597849","actor":{"login":"John1231983","id":24875971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODc1OTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24875971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983","html_url":"https://github.com/John1231983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John1231983/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-04T16:05:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2607597850,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDc1OTc4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelm
