The amount of memory required depends on a bunch of things -- your volume sizes, the model you choose, etc. For the model and volumes we worked with, we needed about 10Gb. You could try smaller images or a smaller model (fewer features per conv layer).\r\n\r\nRight now the data has to in npz files in the training folder, but you can easily change this by basically changing the line in `train.py`: https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/2ce0fc197174ef35debc373dcb6b111632441690/scripts/tf/train.py#L58\r\n\r\nI believe our data loaders work with npz files or nifti files or mgz files etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/724013442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3973750283,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk3Mzc1MDI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3973750283","actor":{"login":"Rasoul20sh","id":32484434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32484434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh","html_url":"https://github.com/Rasoul20sh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T13:29:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3973750287,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NzM3NTAyODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3973750287","actor":{"login":"Rasoul20sh","id":32484434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32484434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh","html_url":"https://github.com/Rasoul20sh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasoul20sh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T13:29:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3973750898,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5NzM3NTA4OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3973750898","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T13:29:12Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3988831201,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk4ODgzMTIwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3988831201","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":32196
