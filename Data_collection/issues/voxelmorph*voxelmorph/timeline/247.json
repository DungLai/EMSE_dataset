originally, the model files used in the tutorial were just pure weights-only files - they didn't contain any information about model structure. That's why in the tutorial, the model is first constructed with a given input and unet shape before the weights are loaded with `vxm_model.load_weights('model.h5')`.\r\n\r\nThe `register.py` script will not be able to load a weights-only model file correctly, since it contains no information about the network architecture (number of layers, input size, etc). Though, I see how this might be an issue for people wanting to try out the tutorial-provided models, so I just updated the `tutorial_data.tar.gz` archive with weight files that contain model configuration information. If you redownload the data, your `register.py` command should run correctly (assuming the input images are correctly sized).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/754237409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4166889025,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE2Njg4OTAyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4166889025","actor":{"login":"ixy40","id":56242371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQyMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56242371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40","html_url":"https://github.com/ixy40","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-04T21:42:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4166889029,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNjY4ODkwMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4166889029","actor":{"login":"ixy40","id":56242371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQyMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56242371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40","html_url":"https://github.com/ixy40","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-04T21:42:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/759369201","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/247#issuecomment-759369201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/247","id":759369201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTM2OTIwMQ==","user":{"login":"ixy40","id":56242371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQyMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56242371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40","html_url":"https://github.com/ixy40","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ixy40/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T10:51:42Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T10:51:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"than
