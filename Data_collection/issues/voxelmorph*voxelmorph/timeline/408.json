(what are you trying to do/register?)\r\n\r\nHello, I am trying to register 3D head&neck CT images and use hypermorph to find the best regularization parameters.\r\n\r\n**What have you tried**\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 (--image-sigma):\r\nI first trained with the default --image-sigma in train_hypermorph.py (0.05). The results didn't look good probably due to the mse loss being scaled too large. Then I tried --image-sigma =1 and it worked much better. I found in another issue saying --image-sigma hasn't been really used (https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/408). So I just want to make sure: do I need to have a good estimation of image noise or I can just ignore this hyperparameter by setting it to 1.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 (hyperparameter sampling distribution):\r\nL = L_sim + γ * L_reg (γ ∈ [0,+∞])\r\nL = (1-λ) * L_sim + λ * L_reg (λ ∈ [0,1])\r\nI noticed in train_hypermorph.py that λ is uniformly sampled from [0,1]. If the optimal γ is too small or too large (e.g. γ* = 0.01, λ* = 0.0099; γ* = 100, λ* = 0.99), very few samples will be drawn around the optimal value. Will this be an issue? My personal intuition is that if we don't have any prior knowledge about the optimal λ or γ, we could design the distribution of λ such that the corresponding distribution of γ is log uniform. The end-point oversampling (code below) seems to be addressing this issue, but why only oversampling exactly at the endpoint instead of oversampling around the endpoint. I am wondering if you have already conducted any experiment showing that this strategy is robust no matter what value the optimal λ takes?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\n```\r\n# random hyperparameter generator\r\ndef random_hyperparam():\r\n    if np.random.rand() < args.oversample_rate:\r\n        return np.random.choice([0, 1])\r\n    else:\r\n        return np.random.rand()              \r\n```                                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help and thank you for this fantastic work!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
