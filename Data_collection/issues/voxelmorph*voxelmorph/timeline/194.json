am using the voxelmorph legacy branch and I used the register.py script to register two images and save the deformation field found from the registration. For my use of voxelmorph, I need to apply some change to the deformation field and apply the deformation field back onto the moving image. I am having difficulty with applying the saved deformation field back onto an image. I tried looking at the registration code and using the `SpatialTransformer` to accomplish this. \r\nI have tried using this code:\r\n\r\n`y = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='linear', indexing='ij')([moving_img, warp])`\r\n\r\nwhere `moving_img` and `warp` are numpy images corresponding to the moving image and the warp transformation found from the registration. \r\n\r\nHowever, this gives me an error saying:\r\nAll inputs to the layer should be tensors.\r\n\r\nI have tried making both the `moving_img` and `warp` into tensors:\r\n\r\n`y = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='linear', indexing='ij')([tf.convert_to_tensor(moving, np.float32), tf.convert_to_tensor(warp, np.float32)])`\r\n\r\nThis gives me this error:\r\nException: Offset flow field size expected: 1, found: 3\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can apply the warp transformation from register.py back onto an image in voxelmorph?\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
