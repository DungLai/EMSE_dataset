I did not make any progress with it. But I have been testing the PyTorch code with some data that did work (well, train to some degree) with the Keras/Tensorflow model. However, it did not train at all with the PyTorch version (the loss function did not decrease at all). I thought there was a `VecInt` layer in the PyTorch code, but looking at it more, it seems to just call the `SpatialTransformer` function. \r\n\r\nIs there another reason why the PyTorch code is not working properly? I have not delved too deep into the specifics (go through both the Keras/TF and compare with the PyTorch line-by-line to look for differences) but that may be the only way for me to determine the potential issue. It does seem to be \"training\" in the sense that the loss function is not constant, but it is only changing a tiny few decimal places. By that, I mean the model is at least set to `model.training = True` and not `model.eval()`. However, it is not performing as it should be when compared to the Keras/TF version.

appreciated","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/621517946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3286863331,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4Njg2MzMzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3286863331","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg","html_url":"https://github.com/balakg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-29T23:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3286863334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODY4NjMzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3286863334","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg","html_url":"https://github.com/balakg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-29T23:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3286863337,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4Njg2MzMzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3286863337","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-29T23:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3286863342,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODY4NjMzNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3286863342","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"ht
