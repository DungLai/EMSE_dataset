Visually or with a metric (like mse) evaluate how good the images are aligned after you run voxelmorph. This is usually not a good idea to do by itself, since an algorithm could give you well-matching results with really irregular deformations. So:\r\n2. Visually or with a metric (like a Jacobian determinant) look at the deformation field itself and make sure it's regular.\r\n\r\nThe best thing you could do is take some time to put some consistent landmarks on a few images (not many, even 5 would be helpful) and use the distance between landmarks as a measure of improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/455547097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2082916749,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA4MjkxNjc0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2082916749","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T13:32:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/470098562","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/23#issuecomment-470098562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/23","id":470098562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDA5ODU2Mg==","user":{"login":"ZQYzqyZ","id":37853680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUzNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37853680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ","html_url":"https://github.com/ZQYzqyZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZQYzqyZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T13:01:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T13:01:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
