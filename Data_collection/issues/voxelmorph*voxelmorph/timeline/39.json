Are you using ismilar data and processing? If not, I do recommend you train a new network (probably best to train from scratch, in fact, so there are not biases, but you should feel free to initialize with our models.).\r\n\r\nvm1 and vm2 are simply different architectures, vm2 is slight bigger which takes longer to train but gives slightly better results. We recommend you use `vm2` or `vm2double`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489167069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2317945569,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMxNzk0NTU2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2317945569","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T17:00:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2317945573,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxNzk0NTU3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2317945573","actor":{"login":"JianshuiChen","id":49380862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgwODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49380862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen","html_url":"https://github.com/JianshuiChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T17:00:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2317945574,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTc5NDU1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2317945574","actor":{"login":"JianshuiChen","id":49380862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgwODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49380862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen","html_url":"https://github.com/JianshuiChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-03T17:00:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489327519","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/39#issuecomment-489327519","

@adalca \r\nI am a collaborator of @JianshuiChen . Our data (fundus images) is different from yours. So what we need to do is train a new registration model for the fundus image. We used ```vm2``` as the pre-training model during training, but the model's prediction results were ugly. We are wondering if not using your pre-training model will make the registration result better. In addition, how do we change the code so that we don't use any pre-trained models? We are newcomers in Tensorflow.\r\nthank you very
