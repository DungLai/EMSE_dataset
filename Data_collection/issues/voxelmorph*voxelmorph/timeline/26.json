I believe any way you do this splitting will lead to comparable results to what we have in the paper.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/464083008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2142719277,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE0MjcxOTI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2142719277","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T15:08:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2142719283,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE0MjcxOTI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2142719283","actor":{"login":"lihaoliu-cambridge","id":19239227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM5MjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19239227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge","html_url":"https://github.com/lihaoliu-cambridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T15:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2142719285,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNDI3MTkyODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2142719285","actor":{"login":"lihaoliu-cambridge","id":19239227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM5MjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19239227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge","html_url":"https://github.com/lihaoliu-cambridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lihaoliu-cambridge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-15T15:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319176131,"node_id":"MDEyOkxh
