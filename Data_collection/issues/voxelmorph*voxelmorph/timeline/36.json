Thi sis an intermediate field that is used to reconstruct the deformation field. By default, the velocity field is only computed every 2 pixels, which is why you get the different size.\r\n\r\nI would recommend sticking to the cvpr version for now and seeing why it fails. Could you see if simply doing `keras.models.load_model(...)` works with the `cvpr2018_vm2_cc.h5` file, and the vm2 parameters?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489367937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2319262552,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxOTI2MjU1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319262552","actor":{"login":"zoujinger","id":27009979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDA5OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27009979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger","html_url":"https://github.com/zoujinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:43:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319262553,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTkyNjI1NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2319262553","actor":{"login":"zoujinger","id":27009979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDA5OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27009979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger","html_url":"https://github.com/zoujinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoujinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T21:43:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
