Changing these means to sums won't affect the behavior\r\n\r\n2. Your intuition is right. This was because of a discrepancy in our implementation with our math (which I believe we fixed in the MedIA paper) -- at the time, the network was predicting the scaled velocity field in 'scaling and squaring'. I don't recall the exact details, but as a back-of-the-envelope calculation, with lambda ~ 10000 you would get a variance of roughly `2/(6 x 10000)`, (6 because of the degree of grid connections) so standard deviation = 0.08. This was the variance of the *scaled* velocity, scaled by the number of integration steps: `2^nb_steps` = 128, so the real standard deviation is 0.08*128 = 1 (roughly).
