@XXZhou25 Thanks for your comment on voxelmorph\r\n> \r\n> Just to be clear, are you saying that the code you used, `gradientLoss` is the one that worked or the one that didn't ?\r\n\r\nHi, sorry to probably confused you! The `gradientLoss` I used in voxelmorph, which is `voxelmorph.losses.Grad('l2')` didn't work. Actually I am not sure if it is this loss didn't work. \r\nMore accurately, the combination: `losses = [vxm.losses.NCC().loss, vxm.losses.Grad('l2').loss]` didn't reduce the dvf loss as expected. I got out-of-image displacements. \r\n\r\nBtw, I am also not sure if it is my data's problem. I standardized it before training. It worked fine with my own loss code.
