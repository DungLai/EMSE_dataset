BTW, one thing to try, since `vxm` is all about learning to approximate the registration output, is to feed voxelmorph image pairs similar to the one you've built, but slightly different each time. E.g. at each iteration, initialize one image with two boxes randomly placed, and another image with those boxes shifted. Seeing multiple examples will slowly teach `vxm` about this sort of exercise, and it may well perform better than if it trains on a single instance (what you've been doing).\r\n\r\n> Anyway, thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nGlad to help. I'm going to close this but feel free to comment if you try more things. I might also move this `issue` to a `discussion` since it turns out to not really be an issue it seems, but more just ... research :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/806621719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4507456599,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUwNzQ1NjU5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4507456599","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T12:11:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4507469297,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1MDc0NjkyOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4507469297","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T12:14:03Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4507552742,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDUwNzU1Mjc0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4507552742","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T12:32:41Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
