The SynthMorph models are fully convolutional and support varying image sizes (within the constraint specified by @adalca above), but they use 3D convolutions and cannot be applied to 2D images. For 2D data, you may wish to follow our demo at https://synthmorph.voxelmorph.net/, which shows you how to train a model and also points to a 2D weights file you could try.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1266574608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mu40","id":29034767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM0NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29034767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40","html_url":"https://github.com/mu40","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu40/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7513940713,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd285TBPq6zwAAAAG_3aLp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/7513940713","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T08:21:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7513940718,"node_id":"SE_lADOB_Nd285TBPq6zwAAAAG_3aLu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/7513940718","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T08:21:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7573780117,"node_id":"CE_lADOB_Nd285TBPq6zwAAAAHDbraV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/7573780117","actor":{"login":"KBlansit","id":6611182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTExODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6611182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit","html_url":"https://github.com/KBlansit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KBlansit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-12T17:04:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1276483531","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/478#issuecomment-1276483531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/478","id":1276483531,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285MFZfL","user":{"login":"KBlansit","id":6611182,"node_id"
