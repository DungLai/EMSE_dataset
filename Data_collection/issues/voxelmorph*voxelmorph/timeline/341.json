Adrian, thanks for your quick and clear reply. I have two questions and hope you can help me.\r\n\r\n1. Since making moving images to the fixed ones is `scan_to_atlas`, why is the atlas only one volume? For example, there are 30 subjects in my datasets and every subject has a pair of moving and fixed. I think the `scan_to_atlas` does not fit the scene.\r\n\r\n2. For the example, I mean that since fixed-moving is the `scan_to_atlas`. Is there some setting like moving-moving which is suitable for `scan_to_scan`?\r\n\r\nThanks for your explanation.

It's just saying that the model *moves* one image to \"match\" the other. \r\n\r\nThe generators are python constructs that feed a pair of images to the models, which are then treated as *moving* and *fixed*. How the generators come up with the two images is up to the generators. We have two generators prepared for you, assuming you have a list of 30 images and one atlas:\r\n\r\n`scan_to_scan` this will randomly grab two images from the 30. Training a model with such a generator means the generator will assume that both the *moving* and *fixed* images are just random scans, and will learn to register scans together.\r\n`scan_to_atlas` will randomly grab one image from the 30, and use the atlas as the other image. A model trained with this generator will only know how to register different scans *to an atlas*. \r\n\r\nThose are essentially two different ways to use registration.\r\n\r\nIf you have a situation where you have 30 **subjects**, and each subject has two images, you'd need to write your own generator (since I don't think we have one written in the `dev` branch, right @ahoopes ?), although it should be fairly easy.
