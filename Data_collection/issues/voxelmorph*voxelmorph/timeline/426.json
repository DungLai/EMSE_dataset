what loss did you use? how much data did you use to train? etc.\r\n\r\n@adalca Thanks for your response. \r\n1. I checked the dimension of each image. As I observed, most of my data has number of slices less than 256 and others are same, which means the third value of its dimension is less than 256 and first two are same. So, if the third value of dimension is less than 256, I will pad it to 256, otherwise, I will crop it to 256. \r\n2. I used ```Scipy.zoom.interpolation``` to downsample by 2 to get 256x256x128.\r\n3. I normalized CT scan using the 0.05, 95 clipping % z-score normalization. Here is the simple demo:\r\n```\r\nmean = np.mean(scan)\r\nstd = np.std(scan)\r\nlb = np.percentile(scan, 0.05)\r\nub = np.percentile(scan, 99.5)\r\nscan = np.clip(scan, lb, ub)\r\nscan = (scan - mean) / std\r\n```\r\n5. The loss I used was MSE and my training data is 28 scans.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to your response!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1124434831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikami520","id":70731556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzMxNTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70731556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520","html_url":"https://github.com/mikami520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikami520/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6594494726,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd285JgvVNzwAAAAGJEAEG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/6594494726","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T01:18:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6594494732,"node_id":"SE_lADOB_Nd285JgvVNzwAAAAGJEAEM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/6594494732","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T01:18:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1124436587","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/426#issuecomment-1124436587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/426","id":1124436587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285DBYpr","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T01:22:26Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T01:22:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"you
