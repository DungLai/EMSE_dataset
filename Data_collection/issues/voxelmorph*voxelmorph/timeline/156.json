First thank you for making the codebase openly available. \r\n\r\nI have been working on this since my comment above. I have managed to solve the -inf issue. Usually the best (lowest) loss value I get is 0.93 or 0.94, which (I think) is a minor improvement over ~0.98 loss value from my first epoch.
