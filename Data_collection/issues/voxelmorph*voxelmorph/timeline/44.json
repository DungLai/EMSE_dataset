Yes, you would lose sharpness with a moved image, since the warp uses linear interpolation (you could also use NN interpolation, but I don't recommend that for warping images.\r\n\r\n2. I think this is an issue with extracting the right labels -- it seems that your warped segmentations is using the freesurfer label IDs and your fixed is in [0, 31]. Can you make sure that for your warped segmentation, you re-mapped the labels according to `labels.mat`? \r\n\r\n4. Looks like a header issue -- how did you save the `nii` of the warped image and which `nii` are you using for the atlas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/523255328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2571496902,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU3MTQ5NjkwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2571496902","actor":{"login":"hassaanmahmood","id":20740538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzQwNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20740538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood","html_url":"https://github.com/hassaanmahmood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T01:17:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2571496903,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NzE0OTY5MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2571496903","actor":{"login":"hassaanmahmood","id":20740538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzQwNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20740538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood","html_url":"https://github.com/hassaanmahmood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hassaanmahmood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-21T01:17:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
