Right now, getting the full miccai version running in pytorch isn't a high priority for us since our preffered running setting for vxm is without sampling, and if necessary the miccai2018 is available in keras for anyone who needs to test it.\r\n\r\nWhat did you need from the miccai version?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/726039854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3988363682,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk4ODM2MzY4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3988363682","actor":{"login":"HP192080042","id":53810832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODEwODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53810832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042","html_url":"https://github.com/HP192080042","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-12T12:11:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3988363691,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5ODgzNjM2OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3988363691","actor":{"login":"HP192080042","id":53810832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODEwODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53810832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042","html_url":"https://github.com/HP192080042","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HP192080042/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-12T12:11:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3988363956,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5ODgzNjM5NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3988363956","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-12T12:11:17Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3988364327,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5ODgzNjQzMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3988364327","actor":{"login":"adalca
