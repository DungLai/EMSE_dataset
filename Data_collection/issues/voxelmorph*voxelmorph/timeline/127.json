loss is changing in the 3rd decimal. And eventually it is just oscillating around these values. The result in registration is just satisfying.\r\n> Then tried to use ncc loss in order to check if I can improve registration but after 5-10 epochs the losses becomes inf and nan as you can see below:\r\n> ![Screenshot from 2019-11-25 18-59-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32677031/69564128-15f68580-0fbb-11ea-9e9c-3712771ef4d5.png)\r\n> \r\n> Do you have any ideas why is this happening?\r\n\r\nI also encountered the same problem. When using ‘ncc’ there will be -inf and nan, but I can’t learn anything with mse training. I wonder if you can introduce your solution. Thank you very much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/748723763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SLKaMiHi","id":73085198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDg1MTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73085198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi","html_url":"https://github.com/SLKaMiHi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLKaMiHi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/748727262","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/127#issuecomment-748727262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/127","id":748727262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODcyNzI2Mg==","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-21T02:49:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T02:49:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@907613871
