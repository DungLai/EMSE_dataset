Proposed changes (copied from 2022-04-05 meeting minutes)\r\n\r\n- Include preprocessing steps\r\n- Load the models weights and build the architecture (using [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) functions)\r\n- Use the models to produce the warping field\r\n- Transform the warping field so it can be used with sct_apply_transfo\r\n- Call this function from the [register function](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/spinalcordtoolbox/scripts/sct_register_to_template.py#L1189) of `sct_register_to_template` \r\n    - And/or `sct_register_multimodal`? (TODO: Needs clarification)\r\n\r\n### Remaining work\r\n\r\n- [ ] Investigate if model can be converted to ONNX, or if we need to depend on VoxelMorph directly\r\n   - NB: If it can't be converted, then SCT will have to depend on Tensorflow once more, which conflicts with the vision for #3735.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1124443124","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/425#issuecomment-1124443124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/425","id":1124443124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285DBaP0","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T01:35:38Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T01:35:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for letting us know.
