Can you please just continue asking on the previous issue #226 ? Even if it's closed, you can continue the discussion :) This allows us to track issues more easily.\r\n\r\n1. Oh, we agree that the code could be simplified -- in fact, in the keras implementation we have a comment with a `#TODO` to simplifythe expression. So I agree on computational complexity. But we've found to not matter much in practice that's why we haven't rushed to it. But I don't think it's wrong :) I don't quite know why you say \"(1) is definitely not the paper means to be\" -- if you expand the top of (6) I do think that's exactly what it comes out to, unless I am misunderstanding your point. Again, I'll tag @balakg  who might comment.\r\n\r\n2. Hmm, I don't believe so. Maybe you can write out the math and show us why you are confused? If you expand the sum, and then imagine doing a conv only for the terms that have a $p_i$ dependency (not those that have `p`), \r\n\r\n3. and 4. I apprecaite you sharing the code, but unfortunately we don't have time to go over and debug code right now. I will note that errors of 1e-8 might be within the precision of various computations involving tensorflow's float16 (not sure)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/709338146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3881693298,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4MTY5MzI5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3881693298","actor":{"login":"flealq","id":7707974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDc5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq","html_url":"https://github.com/flealq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-15T13:49:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3881693306,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODE2OTMzMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3881693306","actor":{"login":"flealq","id":7707974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDc5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq","html_url":"https://github.com/flealq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-15T13:49:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3881693322,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4MTY5MzMyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3881693322","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg","html_url":"https://github.com/balakg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-15T13:49:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3881693328,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODE2OTMzMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3881693328","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/us

I see that by subtracting I_sum (which in your case should probably be named I_avg) from I directly, you are trying to do the \"normalizing\" step. But what you have really done there is just left out the voxels in that window other than the one in the middle.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I am wondering if calc_cross_my has any sort of mathematical significance given that you mentioned that this loss has been working for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1150569770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kvttt","id":99367900,"node_id":"U_kgDOBew73A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99367900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt","html_url":"https://github.com/kvttt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvttt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6774046502,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd284rCdvlzwAAAAGTw78m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/6774046502","actor":{"login":"flealq","id":7707974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDc5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq","html_url":"https://github.com/flealq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-09T01:18:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6774046505,"node_id":"SE_lADOB_Nd284rCdvlzwAAAAGTw78p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/6774046505","actor":{"login":"flealq","id":7707974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDc5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq","html_url":"https://github.com/flealq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-09T01:18:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
