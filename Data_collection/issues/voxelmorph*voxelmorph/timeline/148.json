We've implemented the scaling and squaring in pytorch in the `redesign` branch, which is our current effort to refactor and organize voxelmorph which I'm hoping we'll be able to release soon (but is a branch you can look at). We have not implemented the probabilistic aspect. If you'd like to help with that, we would certainly consider pull requests -- but just keep in mind that the redesign branch is what we'll be using soon.\r\n\r\nDoes this make
