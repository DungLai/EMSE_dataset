Obviously there might be a dependancy on the data and  Can you tell us which part does not work for you? \r\n\r\nThe obvious things to pay attention to are what data are you using, and how is it normalized (the noise parameter will affect this, which will indirectly control the regularity of the field)? What were the loss parameters you used, and how many velocity integration steps?\r\n\r\nThe velocity field integration will lead to diffeomorphism up to numerical issues. You can see a numerical analysis of our integration code in this paper (end of experiments): https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03545 .
