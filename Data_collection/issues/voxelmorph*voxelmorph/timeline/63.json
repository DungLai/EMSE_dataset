If you used the tralairach transform, you should not have to do any more affine warping.\r\n\r\n> yes, this sounds right. We use\r\n> `mri_convert` with the option `--apply_transform`.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to confirm, did you use \"mri_convert on norm.mgz with the option --apply_transform talairach.xfm\"?\r\n\r\nThanks in
