It works but it's very slow and limited by the memory.\r\n\r\nis it slow without the validation generator?\r\n\r\n> For semi-supervised and \"unsupervised 2.0\", we use the generator found in your repository (respectively semisupervised and volgen) for the x data but when we use the same generator for the validation_data, at the end of the first epoch, the fitting is stuck in an infinite loop or return val_loss equals to 0 at the end of each epoch. This also occurs when the semisupervised generator is called in a comprehension list in order to \"convert it\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I fully understand, would you mind providing some code? @ahoopes  did you happen to see any of this?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/767861283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4252974370,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI1Mjk3NDM3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4252974370","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-26T22:12:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4252974372,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNTI5NzQzNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4252974372","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-26T22:12:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4252974378,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI1Mjk3NDM3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4252974378","actor":{"login":"madtoinou","id":32447896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ3ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32447896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou","html_url":"https://github.com/madtoinou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madtoinou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-26T22:12:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4252974381,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNTI5NzQzODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4252974381","actor":{"login":"madtoinou","id":32447896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ3ODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserco
