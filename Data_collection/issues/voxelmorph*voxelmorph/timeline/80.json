wanted to train my own model（miacci2018）, using CT images of the lungs. The image has no additional segmentation data. The image size is 282×208×224. I've learned that images need affine changes and normalization. I don't know how to modify the program next, where to modify, and how to import the data.\r\nI run test.py to see if the environment is configured correctly. I didn't make any changes or input to test.py. But found error: File\"test.py\",line83,in test(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]) list index out of range.\r\nThank you very much for your reply. I just started to learn python, but my friends and teachers gave me few instructions, so it was quite difficult. So some simple questions I do not understand, I hope it didn't cause you trouble.
