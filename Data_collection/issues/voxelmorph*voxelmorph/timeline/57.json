The latter implementation is a more \"consistent\" one with the physical definitions of the paper -- that is, `VecInt` takes in the actual velocity field, which is integrated in several ways (including scaling and squaring). This process (of scaling by 2^N and integrating) is described in the Paper, and really comes from classical work. If you think about numerical integration (e.g. via quadrature, which i find easier to explain), you want to break up the field into small steps and integrate over those, which is what is going on here (except the squaring enables faster integration, as discussed in the paper).\r\n\r\nThe original implementation essentially had a typo -- it should have divided by 2^N.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/498470643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2386577698,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4NjU3NzY5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2386577698","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T00:10:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2386577701,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4NjU3NzcwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2386577701","actor":{"login":"Barnonewdm","id":22175925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc1OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22175925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm","html_url":"https://github.com/Barnonewdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T00:10:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2386577702,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODY1Nzc3MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2386577702","actor":{"login":"Barnonewdm","id":22175925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc1OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22175925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm","html_url":"https://github.com/Barnonewdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barnonewdm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T00:10:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2399480508,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzOTk0ODA1MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2399480508","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_

Thanks for your fast response. And yes, it is my confusion. Most of important, why the \"mean folding vox\" decreases with the larger integration step?
