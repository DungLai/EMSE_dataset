Currently I am testing the CVPR one with reg_param of 1.5 and it seems to be doing a much better job.\r\n\r\nI have a question about the losses, I attached a txt file where you can see the values of the losses in ~150 epochs. It looks like that all the losses, both for training and validation, are not changing or have just small variations, is this behaviour normal? I have seen it in all runs I made so far, similar behaviour when I was using MSE loss.\r\n\r\n[07082019T162303_log.txt](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/files/3480346/07082019T162303_log.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/519399075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"riccardosamperna","id":6599726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTk3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6599726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna","html_url":"https://github.com/riccardosamperna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riccardosamperna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/519543936","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/82#issuecomment-519543936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/82","id":519543936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTU0MzkzNg==","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T14:31:37Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T14:31:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"- if the CVPR version works and the MICCAI version does not with NCC, I think it just requires a better choice of hyper-parameters.

MICCAI model gives you diffeomorphisms and probabilities -- which of these do you need, if any? If you want both, the KL loss is a clean thing to use, and this includes a smoothing factor since the KL term includes a graph laplacian. \r\n\r\nHowever, if all you desire are diffeomorphisms, then you could just avoid using the sampling layer that adds probabilities, and use Grad('l2') on the final displacement after diffeomorphisms. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to continue this discussion, though,
