If you have some sort of manual annotation common to both modalities (segmentations or markers) that would be easiest. Otherwise, we could provide you with some initial implementations of mutual information losses we have, but don't know how well it would work for you.\r\n\r\nRegistering (Fundus+CT) to another (Fundus+CT) is another story. You need to stack each pair and use that as input. You should be able to use our network, except make a change such that when the unet_core is called, `src_feats` and `tgt_feats` are each `2` (to represent the fact that you have two modalities as input). So, for example if you want to use the `cvpr` network, you could modify `cvpr2018_net` so that when it calls `unet_core`, it passes those arguments. All else should work\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n-

We have encountered some issues when using your project in our research.\r\nThere are about 40 patients in our dataset, and each patient contains one OCT scan and one fundus image. Our task is to register OCT scans to  fundus images and we hope to train the model by adopting all 40 patientsâ€™ data.\r\nCurrently the option we take to do this task is:\r\n> The fundus image is treated as the fixed image while the OCT scan is treated as the moving image. Then, we attempt to change the \"datagenetater.py\" so as to load the moving iamge (OCT scan) and the fixed image (fundus iamge) simultaneously. At last, we train the model.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of in-depth knowledge of Tensorflow, we hope that you can point out how we can load a fixed image while loading a moving image in your code. We are also thinking about whether we need to use a new loss function to optimize our model? Can you give us some guidance on how to better solve our tasks?\r\nWe would be grateful for your help!\r\n\r\n![example](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/005CmS3Mly1g2q6htkcdgj30bu08lglq.jpg)\r\nThe left is color fundus and the right is OCT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489378821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JianshuiChen","id":49380862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgwODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49380862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen","html_url":"https://github.com/JianshuiChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JianshuiChen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/489438575","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/38#issuecomment-489438575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/38","id":489438575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQzODU3NQ==","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-05T15:52:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T15:52:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"From the looks of it, this is it's own research project, and it won't be trivial.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to start with voxelmorph and writing a new generator that is similar to how we load both images and segmentations in `example_gen`.

Just to confirm, the returned \"zero\" matrix (in [[oct, fundus], [fundus, zeros]]) is expected to be same shape/size with the moving image, correct? Seems this is how it works both in the sample code and the code in datagenerator.py.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/509736120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"norris9410","id":32683143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjgzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32683143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410","html_url":"https://github.com/norris9410","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/509764047","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/38#issuecomment-509764047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/38","id":509764047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTc2NDA0Nw==","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T18:55:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T18:55:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"the
