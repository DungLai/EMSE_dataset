You can therefore create a new model from your current model: something like `new_model = keras.models.Model(model.inputs, model.get_layer('diffflow').outputs)` . Now the new model will output that deformation field. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that you can continue commenting on closed issues -- they are only closed if we think that issue has been solved, but if you

am following up again on this issue of the deformation field output from VoxelMorph. I need the warp from VoxelMorph in order to measure the recovery error from my images, and compare the recovery error from ANTs SyN and a few other non-linear techniques. I want to make sure that I am best representing VoxelMorph results. \r\n\r\nThe warp was obtained as suggested, and thus outputs as an npz file. I take this file and convert to a minc grid (with correct orientation) + corresponding xfm file. I then resample the labels with the warp externally from VoxelMorph. However, I noticed that the recovered label does not look like the recovered output from VoxelMorph. For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12600191/82130452-6e078b00-9799-11ea-862a-3e7f5b7dbdef.png)\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is the label is resampled differently than how VoxelMorph resamples the output image. However, there is no way to access the resampler within VoxelMorph. I was hoping you could help determine the best way to extract the warp? I have thought of a few methods to approach this problem:\r\n\r\n- Use the resampler externally? \r\n- Pass the label through VoxelMorph such that it is resampled by the exact same warp as it's recovered output? \r\n- Create a 3D grid internally such that a transform can be created externally from x-x', y-y', z-z'?\r\n\r\nIf you have the time to help I would sincerely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/629713764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vmadge","id":12600191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjAwMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12600191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge","html_url":"https://github.com/vmadge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/629806573","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/81#issuecomment-629806573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/81","id":629806573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTgwNjU3Mw==","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T14:24:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T14:24:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @vmadge ,\r\n\r\nApologies, I'm not quite sure I understand the problem (I should also mention that I dont know what system you are using and what your process is -- I assume a \"minc grid\" is ANTs terminology?). \r\n\r\nYou said \"there is no way to access the resampler within VoxelMorph\" -- what do you mean by this?

\r\n\r\nGiven two images, VoxelMorph gives you to warp between them (e.g. warp from src to target, so the vectors are in the space of the target).\r\n\r\nWith this warp you can warp anything from the source space. You can warp the original image, or a label map, or whatever you want. \r\n\r\nWhich version of voxelmorph you are using or trained? We are currently in a transition to a new structure of the code, but if you are using the `master` branch and the `cvpr` model for example, then I recommend you look at https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/blob/master/src/test.py to see how we registered two volumes, then used the resulting field to warp a label map.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/629825672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/629833288","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/81#issuecomment-629833288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/81","id":629833288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTgzMzI4OA==","user":{"login":"vmadge","id":12600191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjAwMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12600191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge","html_url":"https://github.com/vmadge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T17:33:41Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T17:33:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\"same warp\" refers to the warp between two images (fixed + moving).
