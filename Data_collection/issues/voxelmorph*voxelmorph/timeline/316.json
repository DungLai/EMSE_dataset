I'm sorry to bother you again, these questions may seem silly!\r\n> \r\n> 1. I want to use two GPUs for training，and run `pythontrain.py /mnt/home/lqu/lx/vox1/input  --model-dir /mnt/home/lqu/lx/vox1/output --batch-size 2 --gpu  0,1 `\r\n>    I got an error`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0,1'`，I confirm that these two GPUs can be used separately. Looks like something went wrong with my commands，so what is the correct command？\r\n> 2. `transformer_loss` and `flow_resize_loss` How did they figure out？ What do they stand for？\r\n>    Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nexcuse me, can you tell me what in your input file???","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/958753868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WwwwJX","id":93645262,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZTpzg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93645262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX","html_url":"https://github.com/WwwwJX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5575507268,"node_id":"CE_lADOB_Nd284122onzwAAAAFMU31E","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5575507268","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-05T16:29:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
