For training your own model, we provide train.py and train_miccai.py, to which you will need to provide the path where all your files are. It would be optimal if your data is normalized to `[0, 1]`.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to transform `.nii` files to `.npz` files -- our datagenerators work with `.nii` as well (see `load_volfile` in `datagenerators.py`. You might need to make a small change in the training file where `train_vol_names` is set, but that should be it.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/455422068/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2081992023,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA4MTk5MjAyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2081992023","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T04:14:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2081992027,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA4MTk5MjAyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2081992027","actor":{"login":"takerujason","id":33355267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzU1MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33355267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason","html_url":"https://github.com/takerujason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T04:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2081992028,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwODE5OTIwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2081992028","actor":{"login":"takerujason","id":33355267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzU1MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33355267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason","html_url":"https://github.com/takerujason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takerujason/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-18T04:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/455468460","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/22#issuecomment-455468460","issue_url":"https://api
