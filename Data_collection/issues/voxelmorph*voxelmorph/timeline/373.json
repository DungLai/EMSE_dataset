It is easyly understand becuase the second time Image registration output is similar than with Groudn Truth. The problem: we have to determine exactly where the image is the \"train_fixed.nii path\", where is the \"test_moving.nii\".\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  @WwwwJX, Can you capture your pair.txt file or comment when you run your test code. because I am confused to run this test step?. I mean : How do you setting with command line args in the test.py file. or **How does look like the pair.txt file for the \"test_moving.nii\" and \"train_fixed.nii\" path?** Aslo  --img-suffix, --seg-suffix, --img-prefix, --seg-predfix that is arguments in the test.py file. Thanks.\r\n\r\n- ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n3) Dear @adalca, @ahoopes and everyone,\r\nFor example, with the brain data from( https://github.com/adalca/medical-datasets/blob/master/neurite-oasis.md)\r\nPlease guide us to something, thank you @adalca @ahoopes .\r\n\r\n+ About setting --pairs, --img-suffix, ...in the test.py file. I also tried to do **but I do not image yet about how do we create the --pairs ( pairs.txt)** to have the pair image input although read your comments the \"--pairs\" is the pairs.txt file of pair image input include fixed image and moving image? Does it mean a .txt file, like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37217354/147455448-667962c5-33f6-4b2c-9294-e69143c78a93.png)\r\n\r\nMy status: \r\n-

Each line in the 'pairs' text file should define a (moving, fixed) image pair to align, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOASIS_OAS1_0001_MR1 OASIS_OAS1_0002_MR1\r\nOASIS_OAS1_0003_MR1 OASIS_OAS1_0004_MR1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you could, for example, use the corresponding 35-label segmentations to compute accuracy using a command similar to:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython test.py  \\\r\n    --pairs pairs.txt  \\\r\n    --img-prefix /path/to/oasis/data/  \\\r\n    --seg-prefix /path/to/oasis/data/  \\\r\n    --img-suffix /aligned_norm.nii.gz  \\\r\n    --seg-suffix /aligned_seg35.nii.gz  \\\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@WwwwJX are you asking why the Dice scores differ depending on the deformation direction? or why these scores are in the 60s?\r\n\r\nThe scores will differ depending on the direction for multiple reasons. The two *individually-computed* warps are not perfect inverses of each other since the moving image differs in both cases. Even if the two deformations were perfect inverses, the moving segmentation is still different and therefore resampling noise will be introduced.\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about the Dice scores, you could modify `test.py` to save the moved images/segmentations and look into which label(s) are poorly aligned. Maybe it's an issue with the model or maybe not. If the alignment result is bad, we can troubleshoot further, but keep in mind Dice is not a perfect measure of registration accuracy. It's possible the alignments are quite good in reality, so you should look for yourself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1004200091/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5836082835,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd284_eYXuzwAAAAFb246T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5836082835","actor":{"login":"WwwwJX","id":93645262,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZTpzg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93645262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX","html_url":"https://github.com/WwwwJX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T16:16:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5836082840,"node_id":"SE_lADOB_Nd284_eYXuzwAAAAFb246Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5836082840","actor":{"login":"WwwwJX","id":93645262,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZTpzg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93645262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX","html_url":"https://github.com/WwwwJX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WwwwJX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T16:16:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1004207193","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/373#issuecomment-1004207193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/373","id":1004207193,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd28472vxZ","user":{"login":"tphankr","id":37217354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjE3MzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37217354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr","html_url":"https://github.com/tphankr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tphankr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-03T16:26:57Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T13:02:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
