After training and testing, I got the image The dice score for registration is about 0.73, which is excellent.\r\n\r\nNow I have trained the model with **hypermorph**. I hope to calculate the **dice score** on my test set to better judge the result of image registration.

score**) if possible.\r\n\r\nthank you

the code to sweep across lambda values or even optimize lambda for a specific set of images is not yet in the repository - that will be added very soon. In the meantime, you could customize the `test.py` script a bit for HyperMorph by adding a couple lines to loop over and evaluate lambda values. Something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor hyp_n, hyp_lambda in enumerate(np.linspace(0, 1, 20)):\r\n    ...\r\n    hyp = np.array([[hyp_lambda]], dtype='float32')  # reformat hyperparam\r\n    moved = model.predict([moving, fixed, hyp])[0].squeeze()\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut yes, I should definitely add a `test_hypermorph.py` script for this.

professor,\r\n  Considering that you haven't provided **test_hypermorph.py** yet to calculate dice score, we try to implement this code ourselves under your guidance.([voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/293])\r\n   Our implementation as follows:\r\n```python\r\n         for hyp_n, hyp_lambda in enumerate(np.linspace(0, 1, 20)):\r\n              hyp =

print(\"warp.shape = \", warp.shape)\r\n              # warp_vol = nib.Nifti1Image(warp, fix.affine)\r\n              # nib.save(warp_vol, \"wrap1\")\r\n              warped_seg =

need your help. We would be grateful if you could help us to analyze the possible causes. thank you professor！\r\n\r\nWe will share our  implement code to test hypermorph later if the problem is solved. \r\n\r\n At the same time, we are looking forward to your release of the official version of  ` test_hypermorph.py ` so that we can use hypermorph more easily\r\n\r\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
