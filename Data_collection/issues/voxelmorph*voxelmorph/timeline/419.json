you both for the great comments!!!\r\nI tested a few values for --image-noise (0.05, 0.2, and 1) and got something similar to Figure 12 in the paper.

So image noise of 0.2 would correspond to ~ 800 HU, which doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what is wrong but the following are my random thoughts:\r\n> I am thinking of this sigma as a scaling constant instead of the real image noise. I guess for MRI image reconstruction, it is fair to normalize the MSE by image noise as we know the noise is Gaussian. But in image registration, the MSE seems to be a mixture of Gaussian noise and registration error (non-Gaussian). So, I am wondering in this case, does this optimal sigma value still have the physical meaning of image noise.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1136978717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiaogengen-007","id":45641353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjQxMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45641353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaogengen-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1139881608","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419#issuecomment-1139881608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419","id":1139881608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285D8TaI","user":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T17:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T17:41:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"In reality, sigma shouldn't really represent intrinsic 'image noise' across a dataset.

Or at least we need to run hypermorph with an estimated sigma and then we can calculate a better estimation of it based on the Dice-lambda curve. Is that correct, or does a better way to estimate this sigma exist?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1142715181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiaogengen-007","id":45641353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjQxMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45641353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaogengen-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaogengen-007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1142905547","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419#issuecomment-1142905547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/419","id":1142905547,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285EH1rL","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T00:48:19Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T18:03:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Well
