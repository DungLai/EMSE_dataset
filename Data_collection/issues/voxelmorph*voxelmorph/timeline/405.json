To evaluate voxelmorph's performances with DICE score you are using segmentations labels of anatomical regions/area, I'm wondering how do you obtain them on the warped images obtained after the

you asking how to segment the original images or how to warp segmentations?\r\n\r\nto segment original images we sometimes have manual segmentations or something done with algorithms (see e.g.
