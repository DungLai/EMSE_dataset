 Dear author. I am also reading your paper ' An Unsupervised Learning Model for Deformable Medical Image Registration'. My task is to register the lung 4D CT by unsupervised model. I want to use voxelmorph to do it. I have the a lot of data now and size is 25625694. I want to train my model. What should I do next? Here are the steps I guessed, I hope you give more detailed steps.\r\n1.making sure the data is the same size (pad if necessary) and a multiple of 16,\r\n（e.g 25625694——>256256256）normalizing to [0-1].\r\n2.The format of the CT is dicm, which needs to be given as npz. Or change the npz in the code to DICM.\r\n3.run train.py.\r\nWhat else do you need before the third? What is the order in which the programs in these files （data,ext,models,src and unified_seg） are run?\r\nLooking forward to your answer.

Hi！\r\nIn the author's work.There are three `.py` files that can be run separately: `register.py` ` train.py` and `test.py`. \r\n`register.py` is responsible for registering two images; `train.py `is responsible for the training model; `test.py` is responsible for testing the model(the overlap of different anatomical structures in two images can be calculated, and the Dice score is the measurement index). Check out the author's `README.md` for details.\r\nFirstly, you can try to run `register.py` to register  two images(atlas_norm.nii.gz/test_vol.nii.gz) provided by the author and you will get an interesting result, which is helpful to understand the image registration.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the author's papers has helped me a lot and I hope you can also benefit from reading it again and again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/510966616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2479701491,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ3OTcwMTQ5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2479701491","actor":{"login":"qiheihelan","id":52766070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzY2MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52766070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan","html_url":"https://github.com/qiheihelan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-12T17:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2479701492,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0Nzk3MDE0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2479701492","actor":{"login":"qiheihelan","id":52766070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzY2MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52766070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan","html_url":"https://github.com/qiheihelan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-12T17:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/511072994","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/49#issuecomment-511072994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/49","id":511072994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTA3Mjk5NA==","user":{"login":"qiheihelan","id":52766070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzY2MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52766070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan","html_url":"https://github.com/qiheihelan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiheihelan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-13T00:51:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T00:51:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@white-hy
