that sounds good. I can add one. The soon-to-be-released redesign branch will be TF2 compatible, but as you mentioned, there are a few issues in the master branch preventing current 2.0 compatibility. If you manually update the neuron distribution in `ext/neuron` and replace all references to `tf.Dimension` with `tf.compat.v1.Dimension`, that might get things working.
