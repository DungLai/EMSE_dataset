VoxelMorph from pip (`voxelmorph-0.1`), which was released on Sep 5, 2020.\r\n* Version 0.1 does not have the `unet_half_res` argument.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue:\r\n\r\n* Don't install VoxelMorph from `pip`, or\r\n* Limit your scripts to only using features included in `voxelmorph-0.1`, or\r\n* Perhaps the VoxelMorph devs could release a new version on PyPI so that people who run `pip install voxelmorph` can access the newest changes to the model architectures. \r\n\r\nThank you kindly! :)

issue is for planning the integration of @EvanBeal's [contrast agnostic registration model project](https://github.com/ivadomed/multimodal-registration) into SCT's registration scripts.\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes (copied from 2022-04-05 meeting minutes)\r\n\r\n- Include preprocessing steps\r\n- Load the models weights and build the architecture (using [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) functions)\r\n- Use the models to produce the warping field\r\n- Transform the warping field so it can be used with sct_apply_transfo\r\n- Call this function from the [register function](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/spinalcordtoolbox/scripts/sct_register_to_template.py#L1189) of `sct_register_to_template` \r\n    - And/or `sct_register_multimodal`? (TODO: Needs clarification)\r\n\r\n### Remaining work\r\n\r\n- [ ] Investigate if model can be converted to ONNX, or if we need to depend on VoxelMorph directly\r\n   - NB: If it can't be converted, then SCT will have to depend on Tensorflow once more, which conflicts with the vision for #3735.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kousu","id":987487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/987487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu","html_url":"https://github.com/kousu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T20:56:38Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T20:56:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/432","id":1239149378,"node_id":"I_kwDOB_Nd285J2-tC","number":432,"title":"Update
