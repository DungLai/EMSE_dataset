I actually had to manually install pystrum, neurite and voxelmorph as well. In your project folder, clone the three repos:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/adalca/pystrum\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/adalca/neurite\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph.git\r\n\r\nAnd then, run `pip install .`, in the respective subfolders ./pystrum | ./neurite | ./voxelmorph (mind the order).
