Good question, I think the most specific way to answer is to send you to the code that we use to resize this deformation, and specifically look at how we treat the voxel shifts there -- https://github.com/adalca/neuron/blob/f356f3519b1ff2f1d10701b07c32afbf7361ce01/neuron/utils.py#L185. \r\n3. assuming you are usign the `miccai2018_net`, we use the SpatialTransformer (the last layer) (see last lines in that function) to warp. This references a layer we wrote, which calls `transform` in `neuron.utils`, which uses `neuron.utils.interpn`. \r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n- Adrian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/509781287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2470478095,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ3MDQ3ODA5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2470478095","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-09T19:46:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2470478099,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ3MDQ3ODA5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2470478099","actor":{"login":"vmadge","id":12600191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjAwMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12600191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge","html_url":"https://github.com/vmadge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-09T19:46:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2470478100,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NzA0NzgxMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2470478100","actor":{"login":"vmadge","id":12600191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjAwMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12600191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge","html_url":"https://github.com/vmadge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmadge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-09T19:46:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
