Yes, it is possible (in fact we use it in the MedIA 2019 paper to warp surface points!)\r\n\r\nCan you tell us which version of voxelmorph you are using? Once you tell us that, we'll be able to help.\r\n\r\nThe summary is this: If you run voxelmorph to warp moving image B to fixed image A, then you can just apply that warp field to warp any given coordinate in image A back to image B (note the flip in direction). We have some utilities written in the repository, but if you tell us a bit more of your problem we can help more specifically.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/766461541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4243081791,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI0MzA4MTc5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4243081791","actor":{"login":"mariakesa","id":7431201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzEyMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7431201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa","html_url":"https://github.com/mariakesa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-24T23:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4243081792,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNDMwODE3OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4243081792","actor":{"login":"mariakesa","id":7431201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzEyMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7431201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa","html_url":"https://github.com/mariakesa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariakesa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-24T23:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4243081856,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyNDMwODE4NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4243081856","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-24T23:42:33Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/766766774","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/264#issuecomment-766766774","issue_url":"htt
