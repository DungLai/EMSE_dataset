Hello again.  I've been reading an [article ](https://kevinzakka.github.io/2017/01/18/stn-part2/) by Kevin Zakka on STNs.  If I am understanding it correctly, the output of the localisation network should be in the shape that corresponds to the type of transform you are trying to account for (so for an 2D affine transform, the output must be in the shape: 2x3).  I have taken a look at his code and he does reshape his transformation to 2x3, which makes sense as he was trying to account for affine misalignment in images.\r\n\r\nNow, for VM, in the `SpatialTransformer` layer, there are no signs of you reshaping the output of the localisation network.  Instead, you have the output of the localisation network as the same shape as the input image-pair.  Is this what enables VM to be capable of non-linear (deformable) transforms?\r\n\r\nCould you please provide some insight on this, such that I may be better understand it? Thank you.
