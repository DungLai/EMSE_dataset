Yes, I mean warping not wrapping. \r\nI trained a model on the MNIST data following the tutorial on https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WiqyF7dCdnNBIANEY80Pxw_mVz4fyV-S?usp=sharing#scrollTo=joVczQLTPXMZ. \r\nTrain 10 epochs, the loss looks decaying:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148416898-ff13dd71-0405-4f7b-8010-68cbd06175b6.png)\r\nI use the trained model to predict deformation between a moving and fixed image pair, and deformed the moving_image to get the moved_image, which looks fine:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148416970-5d624f6a-810e-45a7-bc34-98f738259f5e.png)\r\nI created some key points (Red points) on the fixed_image,  the blue points are obtained by warping the red points using the exact code I post here. It seems the blue points not quite matching the moving_image. Could it be the problem of bad registration model or the annotation warping  code(method)?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148417045-5949f6d0-99ad-4aea-8ad1-9936f47fcae0.png)\r\nThe code I use:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96538810/148417138-b02e896d-bb07-4a39-9d7c-c10fbf429285.png)\r\nAnother problem I found is: when I run \"vxm.utils.point_spatial_transformer(data)[0, ...].numpy()\" on Windows PC, it got error:\r\n\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Anaconda3\\envs\\voxelMorph\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\python\\framework\\constant_op.py\", line 96, in convert_to_eager_tensor\r\n    return ops.EagerTensor(value, ctx.device_name, dtype)\r\n\r\nValueError: Failed to convert a NumPy array to a Tensor (Unsupported numpy type: NPY_INT).\r\n\r\nWhen I run the same code on a Linux PC using same conda environment as windows, it's fine. How can I make it works on windows?\r\n\r\nI am still working on how to do warping image grid…before this,  I try to visualize the flow, just found it hard to interpret as not knowing the location correspondence  between the myocardium and the flow vectors….. By setting axis on, I can see the origin of image is at upper left corner, while the origin of flow is at lower left corner,  are they presenting the same view/orientation?

vxm utilities, the affine matrix shape should always be `(N, N+1)`, where `N = ndim`, for consistency. So you can crop your 2D input affine matrix to shape (2, 3) with `matrix[:2, :]`.
