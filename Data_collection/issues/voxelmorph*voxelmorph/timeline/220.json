won't determine if your code uses cpu or gpu, that's up to the platform you use (e.g. keras) and the installation you have. For most people with tensorflow-gpu installed, those instructions will run voxelmorph on the gpu.\n\nThis probably has to do with your tensorflow/keras installation. So I would recommend reading into this. e.g.:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44829085/tensorflow-not-running-on-gpu\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/64467035/tensorflow-uses-cpu-instead-of-gpu\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/63016659/why-tensorflow-not-running-on-gpu-while-gpu-devices-are-identified-in-python\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/785085422/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klfxmu","id":56341153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzQxMTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56341153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu","html_url":"https://github.com/klfxmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4371027760,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM3MTAyNzc2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4371027760","actor":{"login":"klfxmu","id":56341153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzQxMTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56341153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu","html_url":"https://github.com/klfxmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-24T13:45:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4371027770,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzNzEwMjc3NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/4371027770","actor":{"login":"klfxmu","id":56341153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzQxMTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56341153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu","html_url":"https://github.com/klfxmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klfxmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-24T13:45:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
