am trying to use VoxelMorph to register the images in the Liver dataset  - [CHAOS](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/Data/)\r\nI have had issues with getting good results on this dataset, in particular, although similarity loss does decrease DICE score doesn't improve. One of the reasons is the artifacts formed outside warped image - for more details please refer [previous issue](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/468) This could be because of the global misalignment between the volumes. Vocelmorph paper mentions that the voxelmorph assumes the global/affine alignment between volumes, in the case of CHAOS dataset there seems some rigid misalignment. I was wondering if mri_robust_register used in Synthmorph can be used here as described in the README?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmri_robust_register --mov in.nii.gz --dst out.nii.gz --lta transform.lta --satit --iscale\r\nmri_robust_register --mov in.nii.gz --dst out.nii.gz --lta transform.lta --satit --iscale --ixform transform.lta --affine\r\n```\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
