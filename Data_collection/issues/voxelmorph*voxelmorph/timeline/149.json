So, in summary, although we do not have a time scale right now(maybe in future),we are just looking to correct for motion artifacts within and between frames.\r\nMore formally,there are n tiff stacks. Each stack has Nimgs where each img is from a depth along the axial plane of the brain, n is the number of channels. Once motion corrected, we are looking to trace the dendrites belonging to a stack in 3d.
