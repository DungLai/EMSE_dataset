issue is for planning the integration of @EvanBeal's [contrast agnostic registration model project](https://github.com/ivadomed/multimodal-registration) into SCT's registration scripts.\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes (copied from 2022-04-05 meeting minutes)\r\n\r\n- Include preprocessing steps\r\n- Load the models weights and build the architecture (using [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) functions)\r\n- Use the models to produce the warping field\r\n- Transform the warping field so it can be used with sct_apply_transfo\r\n- Call this function from the [register function](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/blob/master/spinalcordtoolbox/scripts/sct_register_to_template.py#L1189) of `sct_register_to_template` \r\n    - And/or `sct_register_multimodal`? (TODO: Needs clarification)\r\n\r\n### Remaining work\r\n\r\n- [ ] Investigate if model can be converted to ONNX, or if we need to depend on VoxelMorph directly\r\n   - NB: If it can't be converted, then SCT will have to depend on Tensorflow once more, which conflicts with the vision for #3735.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/3760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6627699653,"node_id":"REFE_lADOB_Nd285J2-tCzwAAAAGLCqvF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/6627699653","actor":{"login":"kousu","id":987487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/987487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu","html_url":"https://github.com/kousu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"babc17f680d80666abd3c76f9c610024ecec60c0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph/commits/babc17f680d80666abd3c76f9c610024ecec60c0","created_at":"2022-05-17T21:27:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kousu","id":987487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/987487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu","html_url":"https://github.com/kousu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kousu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T21:28:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T21:28:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph/issues/1","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph/issues/1/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph/issues/1/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kousu/voxelmorph/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kousu/voxelmorph/pull/1","id":1239176051,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHWj1fc43_Gvr","number":1,"title":"Create
