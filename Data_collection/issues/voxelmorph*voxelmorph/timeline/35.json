A slice is 2D, and the deformation field at each voxel is a 3-D vector, hence the deformation field for a slice is a 2D image with 3 channels, which can easily be visualized as a standard RGB image (one color per direction). For example, you can use `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` in python or `imshow` in matlab. You might need to normalize the values to be in [0,1]\r\n\r\nColumn 5 is simply done by creating a black and white grid (e.g. using `bw_grid` in [pynd](https://github.com/adalca/pytools-lib/blob/master/pynd/ndutils.py)) and warping it with the deformation field that came from `voxelmorph`.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/483902144/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2281356710,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI4MTM1NjcxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2281356710","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-17T01:27:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2281356713,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4MTM1NjcxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2281356713","actor":{"login":"norris9410","id":32683143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjgzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32683143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410","html_url":"https://github.com/norris9410","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-17T01:27:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2281356714,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODEzNTY3MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2281356714","actor":{"login":"norris9410","id":32683143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjgzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32683143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410","html_url":"https://github.com/norris9410","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norris9410/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-17T01:27:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/483903664","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/35#issuecomment-483903664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/rep
