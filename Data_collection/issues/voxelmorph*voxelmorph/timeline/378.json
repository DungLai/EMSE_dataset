Alternatively to @Hoda1394's recommendation, another option is to use the scripts from the master brach, which should always correspond to the most recent pypi release.\r\n\r\n@tphankr regarding the above issue, you should first check to make sure your data is preprocessed in the same way described in the top-level readme (you can use the example OASIS dataset as a reference). If you still run into issues, it's probably best to open a new issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1000947639/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5814413760,"node_id":"CE_lADOB_Nd285AYP9BzwAAAAFakOnA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5814413760","actor":{"login":"ahoopes","id":24280487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgwNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24280487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahoopes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahoopes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-24T23:44:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5814413762,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd285AYP9BzwAAAAFakOnC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5814413762","actor":{"login":"Hoda1394","id":16392763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzkyNzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16392763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoda1394","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-24T23:44:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5814413763,"node_id":"SE_lADOB_Nd285AYP9BzwAAAAFakOnD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5814413763","actor":{"login":"Hoda1394","id":16392763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzkyNzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16392763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394","html_url":"https://github.com/Hoda1394","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hoda1394/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-24T23:44:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5814413764,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB_Nd285AYP9BzwAAAAFakOnE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/5814413764","actor":{"login":"tphankr","id":37217354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjE3MzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.c
