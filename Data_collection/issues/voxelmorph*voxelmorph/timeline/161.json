In the current implementation, the bin centers have to be dataset-wide unless you change the code so that the bin_centers is a Tensor that is an input at each batch -- but this requires bigger changes to the code, including the model. As it stands, it's dataset wide. I don't think it's a big issue though, even if your data is heterogeneous -- if an image has a different intensity profile, it will be reflected in the soft histogram based on the bins, which is what you would want.\r\n\r\n2. Yup sounds good.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/596500954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3110440227,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzExMDQ0MDIyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3110440227","actor":{"login":"boveiri","id":52887476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODg3NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52887476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri","html_url":"https://github.com/boveiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T12:38:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3110440230,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMTA0NDAyMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3110440230","actor":{"login":"boveiri","id":52887476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODg3NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52887476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri","html_url":"https://github.com/boveiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boveiri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T12:38:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3110440438,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMTA0NDA0Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3110440438","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T12:38:59Z","label":{"name":"voxelmorph","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/596801125","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/161#issuecomment-596801125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/161","id":596801125,"nod

you for your timely response and the information provided.\r\n\r\nI think it may be helpful to exemplify: I have 495 pairs of 2D CT/MR slices from 60 subjects (volumes or patients).
