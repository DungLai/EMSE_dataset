Scaling and squaring is just a way to efficiently compute the integration of the stationary velocity field. A more naive solution would be to integrate the field with regular small time steps, but this would involve too many steps and be slow. See \"A fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm\" by Ashburner for more details. \r\n\r\n2. We use a variational method to capture the distribution of registration fields for a given pair. Registration has some inherent uncertainty, so this approach lets us model that.
