Well, first of all, in my case, it may be slightly different from your problem because I am using a combination of DiffeoMorphic and Cycle Morph. Therefore, I will show you a simple way to reverse the `torch.nn.functional.grid_sample `function. For convenience, it is abbreviated as follows.\r\n\r\n`moving_img `: original voxel (X, Y, Z)\r\n`norm_coord`: Normalized coordinates (3, X, Y, Z)\r\n`disp_field`: displacement vector to be shifted from normalized coordinates (3, X, Y, Z)\r\n`deform_field`: Coordinates on the `norm_coord` to be moved at each position (3, X, Y, Z)\r\n\r\nIf you use torch.nn.functional.grid_sample as is, the input to the function will be `m_img` 5D (B, 1, X, Y, Z), `deform_field` (B, 3, X, Y, Z). `deform_field` is the output of VoxelMorph and is the normalized coordinates of the target to be warped backward. It has a size between [-1, 1]. `moving_img` can be converted to `moved_img` as shown below.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nmoved_img = grid_sample(moving_img, deform_field)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to perform the inverse transformation, it is necessary to track the displacement and return the vector in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndisp_field = deform_field - norm_coord\r\ninv_disp_field = - grid_sample(disp_field, deform_field)\r\ninv_deform_field = inv_disp_field + norm_coord\r\nreversed_img = grid_sample(moved_img, inv_deform_field)\r\n```\r\nIt's simple to use, but the inverse transform where it's clipped or there's no pixel mapping needs further improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1187353848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jiwoosong","id":31796284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzk2Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31796284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwoosong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoosong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/1187663052","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/445#issuecomment-1187663052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/445","id":1187663052,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB_Nd285GykzM","user":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-18T15:45:52Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T15:45:52Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thank s @jiwoosong \r\n@eremo2002 does this help?
