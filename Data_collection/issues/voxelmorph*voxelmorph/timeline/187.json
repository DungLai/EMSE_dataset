However, in this case I don't quite understand:\r\nI don't quite see how that line should change? The very reason why there is a loop is to achieve the thickness.\r\n\r\nI also don't fully understand what you are highlighting in the example? If it's the inconsistency in the spacing , I think this is an issue with how matplotlib is showing the image (it needs to do some interpolation since the image is too big to show in that figure axis). You can crop some part of the image to see that it's consistent.\r\n\r\nOr were you trying to show that lines are not thick? You didn't give it a thickness value in those calls, so it defaults to 1.\r\n\r\nAm i
