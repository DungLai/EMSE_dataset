That first loss, which is the data loss I believe, seems incredibly high for the usual losses we use. Or did you change the data loss?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nI am wondering why the image need to be isotropic?\r\nDoes it  improve the accuracy or speed the process?

these definitions refer to the size of the voxels. isotropic means that each voxel in the image represents the same dimension (e.g. 1mm^3). so if a 256^3 image is taken and captures ~(256 mm)^3 area, you would get isotropic voxels.\r\n\r\nanisotropic means that the dimensions are not the same. Often, we see a voxel that is 1x1x2mm or something like that due to acquisition procedures. So the same field would give a 256x256x128 image.
