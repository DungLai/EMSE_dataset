@hassaanmahmood, \r\n\r\n- use some external segmentation tool to create labels for a few subjects (we used FreeSurfer)\r\n- many researchers put small landmarks on a couple of subjects and compare how far away those landmarks are after registration\r\n- visualize the deformed scan compared to the second scan, but you have to be very careful as a under-regularized deformation will look 'better aligned'.
