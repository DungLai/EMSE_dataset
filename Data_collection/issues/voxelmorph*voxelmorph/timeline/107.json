To warp images with a warp coming from ANTs, you should definitely use their tools. To actually warp the images with our warp, we recommend you use either the warped image given by register.py, or use a simple transform network, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ndims = len(vol_size)\r\n    subj_input = Input((*vol_size, 1), name='subj_input')\r\n    trf_input = Input((*vol_size, ndims) , name='trf_input')\r\n    nn_output = nrn_layers.SpatialTransformer(interp_method='linear', indexing=indexing)\r\n    nn_spatial_output = nn_output([subj_input, trf_input])\r\n    warp_model = keras.models.Model([subj_input, trf_input], nn_spatial_output)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen use `warp_model.predict([moving_image, warp_from_vxm])`.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a `warp.py` file for this in the new release, and an easily accessible network!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/552067304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2785080346,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc4NTA4MDM0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2785080346","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-09T05:08:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2785080348,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc4NTA4MDM0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2785080348","actor":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-09T05:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2785080349,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3ODUwODAzNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/2785080349","actor":{"login":"white-hy","id":33248778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQ4Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33248778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy","html_url":"https://github.com/white-hy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/white-hy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-09T05:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/552264437","html_url":"https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/107#issuecomment-552264437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/107","id":552264437,"node_id"
