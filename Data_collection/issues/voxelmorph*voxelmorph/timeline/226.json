thank you for your reply both in #227 and this one. sorry for tagging wrong person... i'm not familier with github...\r\n\r\nfor your reply in #227 and for @balakg :\r\n> 1. Can you please just continue asking on the previous issue #226 ? Even if it's closed, you can continue the discussion :) This allows us to track issues more easily.\r\n\r\ni try to do so... and i closed #227. hope i'm doing the right thing. \r\n\r\n> 2. Oh, we agree that the code could be simplified -- in fact, in the keras implementation we have a comment with a `#TODO` to simplifythe expression. So I agree on computational complexity. But we've found to not matter much in practice that's why we haven't rushed to it. But I don't think it's wrong :) I don't quite know why you say \"(1) is definitely not the paper means to be\" -- if you expand the top of (6) I do think that's exactly what it comes out to, unless I am misunderstanding your point. Again, I'll tag @balakg  who might comment.\r\n\r\nyes, my point is, expand (6) in the paper not equal to the code's implementation. simplify is not needed, i just to make it a more clear one.\r\nand, the right expand is implementated as \"def original_may_want_to(I, J)\", which generate different result with the current code, and identicial with full non expanded version \"def  calc_cross_my(I, J)\" in 227.4.\r\n\r\n**so here is the relationship:\r\ncurrent code result == original_loss == calc_cross_simple\r\ncalc_cross_my (without expand) == original_may_want_to (expanded version)\r\ncurrent code result != calc_cross_my** \r\n\r\n> 3. Hmm, I don't believe so. Maybe you can write out the math and show us why you are confused? If you expand the sum, and then imagine doing a conv only for the terms that have a $p_i$ dependency (not those that have `p`),\r\n> 4. and 4. I apprecaite you sharing the code, but unfortunately we don't have time to go over and debug code right now. I will note that errors of 1e-8 might be within the precision of various computations involving tensorflow's float16 (not sure)\r\n\r\nah... my word lead to missunderstanding. **script in 4 can run without debug.** \"my code do not work\" means in my application (which is about image decomposition but not registration), ncc not work so well.\r\n\r\nbtw, after one day training, my decomposition code like \"def calc_cross_my(I, J)\" in 227.4 got quite good result.\r\nso if current code is right, i think i must misunderstand the paper. so maybe i can take it as my innovation, haha.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/comments/709675900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flealq","id":7707974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDc5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq","html_url":"https://github.com/flealq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flealq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3884186750,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4NDE4Njc1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3884186750","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T01:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3884186752,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODQxODY3NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3884186752","actor":{"login":"adalca","id":3219675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3219675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca","html_url":"https://github.com/adalca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T01:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3884186753,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4NDE4Njc1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3884186753","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg","html_url":"https://github.com/balakg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balakg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T01:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3884186756,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODQxODY3NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/events/3884186756","actor":{"login":"balakg","id":8753801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTM4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8753801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.g
