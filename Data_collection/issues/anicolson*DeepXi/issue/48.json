Then does ResNetV3(which has a very slight difference fromResNetV2) give better/worse performance compared to the ResNetV2? Have you ever tried to compare?\r\n\r\n2. for the demand_voice_bank dataset, does the validation set (if it is used) is fixed? and\r\nAs far as I understand, each utterance in the training set is mixed with random SNR (in the range of [0 5 10 15]) with fixed clean/noise pair) for each epoch. Is it correct..?\r\n\r\n3. I can get the mu/sigma for the CDF mapping function in the data/stats.mat. Is it OK to use these parameters for the demand_voice_bank dataset? OR do I need to calculate the new mu/sigma parameter set?\r\n\r\n4. In deepxi/gain, the function 'deepmmse' returns (1/1+xi) + (xi/(gamma(1+xi))).\r\nBut.. is it right that (1/1+xi)^2 + (xi/(gamma(1+xi)))?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Minseung-Kim","id":38913475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTEzNDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38913475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim","html_url":"https://github.com/Minseung-Kim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Minseung-Kim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
