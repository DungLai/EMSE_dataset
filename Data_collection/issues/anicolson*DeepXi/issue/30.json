It would be more practical if it would search in sub directories and load all files with allowed extensions. \r\n\r\nIm sure that you are aware that it can be easily done something like the following:\r\n`recurs_str='**/*'`\r\n`for i in extension:`\r\n\t\t\t`for j in glob.glob(os.path.join(file_dir,recurs_str, i), recursive=True):`\r\nor with os:\r\n`for root, folders, files in os.walk(file_dir): '`\r\n`\t\t\tfor file in files:`\r\n`\t\t\t\tif file.lower().endswith(' any of the extensions')  load the file and save path`\r\n\r\nI am using both ways for experimentation and it performs as expected.\r\n\r\nBest Regards","closed_by":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
