Very interesting.\r\nI have some questions regarding the data and the training process:\r\n\r\n1. I see that most of the clean speech utterances in _train-clean-100_ and in _VCTK_ are shorter than the receptive field size of the network. Does it mean that this specific databases don't exploit the full potential of the network?\r\n\r\n2. Under the assumption that the network inference is causal (up to one buffer) - does it mean that the SNR estimation in the first seconds is expected to be less accurate due to the short respective field?  I mean to the fact that we don't have enough information about the past, similar to a linear filter that has some \"delay time\" even if it's a minimum phase.   \r\n\r\n3. I noticed that when I use short clean speech files (up to 8 sec) for training this \"delay time\" is shorter than when I use longer files (~up to 20sec). Is it expected? The files in both cases are from the same databases but in the first case I just split them to shorter parts.\r\n\r\n4. Regarding the files normalization  - I noticed that you normalize the noise files according to  |s|/(|d|*SNR). How sparse noise files should be normalized? The problem is that |d| is very depends on the sparsity of the signal. For example the RMS  of noise file containing a slamming door noise every 3 seconds is much lower than the RMS of some constant noise (fan, car, airplane) because in the first case most of the file is a silence. I'm asking because all of the sparse files were created in higher SNR due to very low value of |d|.\r\n     \r\n4. I saw that the databases in the link contain only a single speaker in each file. If I'd like to test cases of several speakers (not simultaneously ) in the same file, similar to a real life conversation, does it mean that I need to train the network with several speaker in each file as well?\r\nIn other words, does the network study specific speaker characteristics or more general characteristics relevant to the human voice?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nAhikam","closed_by":{"login":"ahikaml","id":32457828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDU3ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32457828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml","html_url":"https://github.com/ahikaml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
