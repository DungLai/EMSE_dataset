But in the convolution,  data on the right side of the current frame, that is the future data,  are used.  I think only the data on the left of the current frame, which means history data, can be convolved.  Can you help me to understand how the causal convolution is achieved here.\r\n\r\nThank you！\r\n```\r\ndef CausalDilatedConv1d(x, d_f, k_size, d_rate=1, use_bias=True):\r\n    if k_size > 1: # padding for causality.\r\n        x_shape = tf.shape(x)\r\n\tx = tf.concat([tf.zeros([x_shape[0], (k_size - 1)*d_rate, x_shape[2]]), x], 1)\r\n    return tf.layers.conv1d(x, d_f, k_size, dilation_rate=d_rate, activation=None, padding='valid', use_bias=use_bias)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"20050710212","id":4574648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzQ2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4574648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212","html_url":"https://github.com/20050710212","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20050710212/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
