However, I found the time-cost in training is too long with mbatch=10.\r\n\r\nI have some questions about data preparation & training step:\r\n1. Do you use all of the training sets ( 74250 utterances) in the training step?\r\n2. How long does 1 epoch spend to train?\r\n3. Could you please share the device info for training?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
