I wrote about how to achieve an inference in an already closed issue  #19 , but there is still gaps to fill.\r\n\r\nThis will allow people to give it a quick try at the repo and keep digging in. \r\n\r\n**What about the characteristics of the input audio to perform inference?**\r\n**1.** Should it have a determined `sample rate`,  _e.g._ `16000 Hz` ?\r\n**2.** Should it have a determined `bit rate`,  _e.g._ `256 kbps` ?\r\n\r\n**Is `mmse-lsa` the best gain function to use?**\r\nAs per the result's table in the `README` it looks like, but it is also using `ResNet 3e`, what about `3f`?\r\n\r\n**What should be the expected result of the inference if performed correctly? Could you provide a test audio and a result audio using the weights of `3f` 175 epochs + `mmse-lsa`?**\r\nThis way, we could know if we have the things set up correctly.  Personally, I have try to infer some audios and I am not sure if it is the expected result or know, so this will be a good way to check that.\r\n \r\nAlso, I would like to offer my help (if you allow people to contribute) by adding utils script to allow users to input any kind of audio and convert into the optimal one for the network once these questions are answered.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for you hard work and effort,\r\n\r\nkind regards.","closed_by":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
