(this imply noise recording should be longer than clean speech)\r\n\r\nIf then, Could you tell me how kind of additional noise recording did you use? and Have you used additional clean speech other than provided in Demand voicebank dataset?\r\n\r\n2) In the training step, Deepxi uses both the training set and validation set. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the validation set is often used for early stopping.  Is the validation set in deepxi framework also be used for this purpose?\r\n\r\nCould you explain to me how the validation set was used?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
