I'm using the clean speech from the Librispeech Dataset and the respective train, val and test folders. I trained the network for 200 epochs after deleting the data directory and making the corresponding /set folder as required. Yet I notice that the all the metrics are lower for the trained model as compared to unprocessed speech. ( Initially, I had not deleted the data folder before training, but even after doing that and retraining the results did not improve at all). Here are the metrics:\r\nModel,MOS-LQO,PESQ,STOI,eSTOI\r\nUnprocessed,1.29,1.80,80.68,60.66\r\nDeepXi,1.34,1.58,40.76,25.35\r\nThe unprocessed has been calculated in the same way as the DeepXi, by bypassing the model. Can you help me out with what has gone wrong?\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
