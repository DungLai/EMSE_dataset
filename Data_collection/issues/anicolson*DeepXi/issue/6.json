I can observe the improvement of the enhance speech. Now I want to use the enhanced speech to perform ASR. But I find the performance of enhanced speech is not better than that of noisy speech. How should I adjust the parameters or change the code to decrease the distortion of the enhanced speech?  Could you give some directions about it?\r\nThank you very much!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NewEricWang","id":18108440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA4NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18108440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang","html_url":"https://github.com/NewEricWang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NewEricWang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
