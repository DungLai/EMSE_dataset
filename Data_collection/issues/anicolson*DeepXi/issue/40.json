When testing I observe that after loading the files for inference, I encounter OOM error. Although I was able to train with 1 GPU, with memory about ~10GB, testing requires more space. (Is this expected behavior?) I have access to multiple GPUs, so can you tell me if and how can I use multiple GPUs for the purpose of testing. This is not immediately straightforward from run.sh. Also, can you elaborate on how by just specifying the version does your code select the best iteration?\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"archiki","id":34877432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODc3NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34877432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki","html_url":"https://github.com/archiki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/archiki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
