you Aaron.\r\n\r\nI am planning to stack the layers of Deep Xi and Deep speech, just without applying gain the layers may not lead to any noise reduction or accuracy increase.\r\n\r\nHow couId I estimate the clean signal during the training (of Deep Xi) and feed it forward to DeepSpeech for further training?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/590032475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djo-koconi","id":60088055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDg4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60088055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi","html_url":"https://github.com/djo-koconi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djo-koconi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3064053768,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA2NDA1Mzc2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/events/3064053768","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-24T04:21:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3064053930,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQzMDY0MDUzOTMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/events/3064053930","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-24T04:21:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/590162940","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/20#issuecomment-590162940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/20","id":590162940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDE2Mjk0MA==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T04:22:33Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T04:22:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It

Since the MFCC features is much less, the network parameters can be reduced. Do you have any suggestions?
