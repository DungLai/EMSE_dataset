It's very helpful.\r\n\r\nRegarding (1) see for example the VCTK histogram below. Most of the files are shorter than the net receptive field.\r\nIn the other hand, as I said, somehow the conversion time in the inference is lower when the net is trained on shorter files (up to 2 secs). \r\n\r\nRegarding (3) - No. In long files I just cut any extra silence in the beginning to make the learning as effective as possible. \r\n\r\nRegarding (4) - I assumed that scaling in the time domain is identical to scaling in the frequency domain (Parseval's theorem). If you meant to a different scaling factor per frequency bin then it's not different than equalization.  \r\nLet me know if you think I'm wrong.   \r\nAnyway I thought that scaling by the maximum or by some upper percentile might give a decent solution for this issue but I wasn't really sure. I guess I'll have to try...\r\n\r\nOne more question - is there a good way to know, after the training, what is the effective receptive field size? I mean by looking on the coefficient values of any specific layer? Could it be related to the coefficients values in the residual blocks with the highest dilation ratio?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAhikam\r\n\r\n![DurationHistVCTK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32457828/86958926-9db58c80-c165-11ea-921a-77e9e12e67f9.JPG)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/655701050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahikaml","id":32457828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDU3ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32457828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml","html_url":"https://github.com/ahikaml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/655860883","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44#issuecomment-655860883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44","id":655860883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTg2MDg4Mw==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-09T02:36:12Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T02:36:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"So

for the link. It seems that this site helps you to calculate the theoretical receptive field, i.e. the maximum that the network can \"see\" back to the past . \r\nHowever to me it feels that sometimes, depends on the training data, the network can \"choose\" not to look on such a long history even though its architecture supports that. \r\nFor example when the network has receptive field of 6 sec but it learn that information of more than 2 seconds back to the past isn't relevant to the current SNR.\r\n \r\nIn such case I believe that its coefficients will be updated accordingly to represent this short receptive field. \r\nSo.. the question is: can I recognized such situations by looking on the network coefficient after the training, or it's totally a black box and all we can do is just checking if the 'a priory' SNR we got from the net is accurate enough?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAhikam\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/655917519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ahikaml","id":32457828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDU3ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32457828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml","html_url":"https://github.com/ahikaml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahikaml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/656414294","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44#issuecomment-656414294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/44","id":656414294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjQxNDI5NA==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-10T00:22:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T00:22:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hi
