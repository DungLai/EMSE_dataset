These have 12-13GB of memory, and the mini-batch size is chosen to maximize the use of this. If you have more GPU memory available than this, a larger mini-batch size may reduce the amount of time required per epoch.\n\nHope this helps,\nAaron\n________________________________\nFrom: lupengliu <notifications@github.com>\nSent: Monday, 21 October 2019 9:51 PM\nTo: anicolson/DeepXi <DeepXi@noreply.github.com>\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\nSubject: [anicolson/DeepXi] Question about data preparation & train (#12)\n\n\nAnicolson, thanks for your great effort.\n\nI used Tesla P40 for training. However, I found the time-cost in training is too long with mbatch=10.\n\nI have some questions about data preparation & training step:\n\n  1.  Do you use all of the training sets ( 74250 utterances) in the training step?\n  2.  How long does 1 epoch spend to train?\n  3.  Could you please share the device info for training?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/12?email_source=notifications&email_token=AGHGZ7TRULYTVJJLAZ5OCL3QPWJUJA5CNFSM4JC4E6L2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HTEUTJQ>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGHGZ7W6ZZS6MGXF7RCZYETQPWJUJANCNFSM4JC4E6LQ>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/544638640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/545387865","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/12#issuecomment-545387865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/12","id":545387865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTM4Nzg2NQ==","user":{"login":"lupengliu","id":37216167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjE2MTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37216167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu","html_url":"https://github.com/lupengliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lupengliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T10:56:25Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T10:56:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, thank you for your reply!\r\n\r\nI have used the same training dataset with you, and try to continuouse the training step (e.g. train from epoch 175).
