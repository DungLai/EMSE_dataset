the validation set sir, you noted that: Identical filenames for the clean speech and noise must be placed in 'val_clean_speech' and 'val_noise', with the SNR at the end of the filename. As an example:\r\n'./val_clean_speech/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the clean speech, and './val_noise/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the noise at the same length. They will be mixed together at the SNR level specified in the filename.\r\nSo i have to create a validation dataset myself that a pair of file clean and noise speech has same duration and same name?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/600070959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"darkdante2209","id":38001855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDAxODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38001855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209","html_url":"https://github.com/darkdante2209","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkdante2209/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/600408413","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/25#issuecomment-600408413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/25","id":600408413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDQwODQxMw==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T03:38:53Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T03:38:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Sorry, I do not follow, could you clarify what you said.
