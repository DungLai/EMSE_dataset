The statistics are thus calculated over all the features of a frame and over the entire sequence. So you are right, layer normalisation is non-causal.\r\n\r\nHowever, 3f is using frame-wise layer normalisation. The statistics are calculated only over the features of the frame for frame-wise layer normalisation. This means that no features from future frames are used for the current frame, giving us a causal form of layer normalisation.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: cohendrake <notifications@github.com>\r\nSent: Tuesday, 21 January 2020 1:37 PM\r\nTo: anicolson/DeepXi <DeepXi@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: [anicolson/DeepXi] Is ResNet 3f causal？ (#18)\r\n\r\n\r\nGood job. As layer normalization is widely used in the ResNet 3f, I doubt that it's a causal network—‘future’ features are actually included. I've tried to remove all the layer normalizations and the results turn out to be much worse.\r\nIs layer normalization dispensable?\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/18?email_source=notifications&email_token=AGHGZ7SUVNUCBWUTBV3ZJZDQ6ZUXJA5CNFSM4KJM4SK2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4IHQDEIA>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGHGZ7TEQ657AIJ4KEWXXZTQ6ZUXJANCNFSM4KJM4SKQ>.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/576505752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/576510764","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/18#issuecomment-576510764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/18","id":576510764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjUxMDc2NA==","user":{"login":"cohendrake","id":32091900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDkxOTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32091900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake","html_url":"https://github.com/cohendrake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cohendrake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T04:15:11Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T04:15:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
