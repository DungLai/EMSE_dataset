\r\nHi, Aaron, thanks for the sharing of the RDLnet peper. \r\nIn the experiment section, the configuration of the ResNet is different from the DeepXi. It says,\r\n> Each residual block contained 2 causal dilated convolutional units with an output size of 64, and a kernel size of 3. For each block, d was cycled from 1 to 8 (increasing by a power of 2). ResNets of sizes 0.53, 1.03, 1.53, and 2.03 million parameters were formed by cascading 20, 40, 60, and 80 residual locks, respectively.\r\n\r\n1.
