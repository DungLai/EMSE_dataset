Also, each output node of the network can take on a value the set (0,1), as a sigmoid activation function is used. You can think of each output node representing the probability that the frequency bin is completely speech (i.e. 1 means completely speech, 0 means no speech, and somewhere in between indicates that a proportion is speech). \r\n\r\nBinary cross-entropy (BCE), as opposed to categorical cross-entropy (CCE), can be used as the loss function for this (CCE is used for a categorical distribution over the output nodes, which we are not interested in). With BCE, the target values must be in the set (0,1) (they don't have to be strictly 0 and 1). BCE just measures the difference between the target probability and predicted probability. For pure classification, the target probability is either 0 or 1. Here, the target probability is between 0 and 1 (essentially an output node is learning the CDF of speech in a frequency bin).\r\n\r\nThis was found to be a better alternative to having the *a priori*
