I think that you just need to some experiments. If it is OK, you can also choose MSE as loss.   Deep learning technqiue may also need many explainations.  I know that you may concern that cross-entropy is mainly used for two classed task. But the output is also like a possibility between 0-1 to predict 0 (close to 0) or 1 (close to 1) (never be the exact 0 and 1 ). It is easy to explain that we just want to output ranges from 0-1.   But you can use MSE, if you think it is OK.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/633604874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yunzqq","id":12210635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEwNjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12210635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq","html_url":"https://github.com/yunzqq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunzqq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/633767573","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/37#issuecomment-633767573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/37","id":633767573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzc2NzU3Mw==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-26T01:52:14Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T01:52:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Originally, the cross-entropy loss function was used to estimate the ideal binary mask (IBM) for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). This is a binary classification task, i.e. each target can be 1 (speech dominant) or 0 (noise dominant). This was later extended to the ideal ratio mask, which is just a soft version of the IBM, i.e. values in between 1 and 0 indicate a ratio of speech to noise. The cross-entropy loss function was also used. Cross-entropy loss can be thought of as measuring the difference between two probabilities. For the IRM, the higher the value (i.e. the closer the IRM is to 1), the higher the probability of the spectral component being (completely) speech. Cross-entropy can also be thought of as an error measure restricted to input values in the interval [0,1]. For the IRM and IBM cases, cross-entropy was also used with a sigmoid activated output layer. With a DNN that estimates the clean speech magnitude spectrum, a linear/ReLU output layer must be used with MSE. \r\n\r\nFor IRM, IBM, and CASA, please see the following: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6639038.\r\n\r\nThere is a paper somewhere showing that IRM target + cross-entropy + sigmoid output layer outperforms clean speech magnitude spectrum target + MSE + linear output layer. I will have to find it.\r\n\r\nFor our case, we are estimating the mapped a priori SNR (i.e. the cumulative distribution function of the instantaneous a priori SNR). This can be thought of similarly to the IRM; a value of 1 indicates completely speech and a value of 0 indicates completely noise. And as IRM target + cross-entropy + sigmoid output layer has been found to outperform clean speech magnitude spectrum target + MSE + linear output layer, I chose to replace the IRM of the first case with the mapped a priori SNR.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nAaron.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/633767573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/633768510","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/37#issuecomment-633768510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/37","id":633768510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzc2ODUxMA==","user":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-26T01:56:28Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T01:56:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"To
