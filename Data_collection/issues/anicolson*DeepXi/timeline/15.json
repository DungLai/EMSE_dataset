We are inferring with\ndeepxi.py --infer 1 --out_type xi_hat --gain mmse-lsa\n\nand get the mat files containing the output arrays. How do we interpret this data or do you see an easy function to boil it down to a single value?\n\nâ€”\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/15?email_source=notifications&email_token=AGHGZ7QO672RTP775EWDPKTQZFN4VA5CNFSM4J4C67WKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4IBGCF2A>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGHGZ7QSZGG4W2JD5SJ77VLQZFN4VANCNFSM4J4C67WA>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/566796959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/566802256","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/15#issuecomment-566802256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/15","id":566802256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjgwMjI1Ng==","user":{"login":"olafthiele","id":30040326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDQwMzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30040326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele","html_url":"https://github.com/olafthiele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafthiele/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T23:54:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T23:54:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, will look into that direction.
