so for example, you can have a clean speech waveform with 30,000 samples and a noise waveform with 100,000 samples. just extract a section of the noise waveform that is of length 30,000 (and save it). This is done so that the validation set is identical each time. Otherwise the code will mix the clean speech with a random section of the noise signal, meaning that the validation set will be different each time.
