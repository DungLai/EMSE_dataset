Single-channel is commonly used in speech enhancement due to most cell phone microphone configurations (single microphone).\r\n\r\nVersion 3f is trained to operate on a sampling frequency of 16 kHz, which is currently the standard sampling frequency used in the speech enhancement community (previously the standard sampling frequency was 8 kHz). Deep Xi can be trained using a higher sampling frequency, but this would be unnecessary as human speech rarely exceeds 8 kHz (the Nyquist frequency of a sampling frequency of 16 kHz). \r\n\r\nBit rate is different for each audio codec. As Deep Xi uses PySoundFile, a variety of audio codecs can be used (e.g. .wav, .mp3, .flac, etc). PySoundFile then converts the coded audio to 16-bit PCM (int16). Deep Xi then converts this to float32 and then normalises to [-1.0,1.0]. In short, the bit rate does not affect the performance of Deep Xi. A lossy codec may very, very slightly affect the original audio, however. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/605742527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3238381897,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzIzODM4MTg5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/events/3238381897","actor":{"login":"anicolson","id":26111230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTExMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26111230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anicolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-16T06:31:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/comments/615065393","html_url":"https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/28#issuecomment-615065393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anicolson/DeepXi/issues/28","id":615065393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTA2NTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"betegon","id":28983162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzMTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon","html_url":"https://github.com/betegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betegon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T06:19:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T06:20:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry
