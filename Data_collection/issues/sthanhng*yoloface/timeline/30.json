This code does not have any training code and thus only @sthanhng can give you this although I would recommend to go through the YOLOv3 paper and use their mAP etc. Although if you really need such values, then I suggest reproducing what this code did by either implementing YOLOv3 yourself or using another code base that can also train and then use the Wider Faces dataset to train it and get results.
