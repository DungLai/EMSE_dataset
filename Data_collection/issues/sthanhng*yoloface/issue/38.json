I noticed that your code evaluates each image one by one, and I was wondering how would you modify the code so it works in batches? I tried inputting the images in batches but it only seem to ever return the results from the first image.\r\n\r\nFor example, taking code from https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface/blob/master/yolo/yolo.py#L114, I'd run\r\n```python\r\nout_boxes, out_scores, out_classes = self.sess.run(\r\n    [self.boxes, self.scores, self.classes],\r\n    feed_dict={\r\n        self.yolo_model.input: image_data,\r\n        self.input_image_shape: [image.size[1], image.size[0]],\r\n        K.learning_phase(): 0\r\n    })\r\n```\r\nwhere `image_data` has shape `(2, 416, 416, 3)`, but the return `out_boxes` is `(1, 4)` even if both images in `image_data` are the exact same.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sthanhng/yoloface/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sthanhng/yoloface/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
