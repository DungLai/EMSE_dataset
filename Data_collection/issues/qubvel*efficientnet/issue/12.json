I'm currently looking through the model definition to solidify my understanding of the paper. I've noticed something odd in the parametrisation of the blocks: https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/params.py#L170 - \r\n's22' means a stride of [2,2] which means downsampling both image dimensions by half while 's11' means a stride of [1,1] which means no downsampling (this is obvious to you I guess). Your order of strides is: s11 s22 s22 s22 s11 s22 s11 but according to Table 1 in the paper, I think it should be s11 s22 s22 s1 s22 s22 s11.
