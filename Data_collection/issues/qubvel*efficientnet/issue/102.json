While using `EfficientNetB3` i am getting the following error  \r\n`Resource exhausted: OOM when allocating tensor with shape[15,95,95,192] and type float`  \r\n\r\nI understand this because my data does not fit in GPU. But when I try `InceptionResNetV2` i did not get any error.\r\n\r\nNumber of trainable parameters in `EfficientNetB3` is `22,220,824`   \r\nNumber of trainable parameters in `InceptionResNetV2` is `109,380,744`   \r\n\r\nNumber of trainable parameters  in `InceptionResNetV2` are `5` time more than `EfficientNetB3`. So I am expecting `InceptionResNetV2`to throw error not `EfficientNetB3`.\r\n\r\nAny idea why I am getting resource error in `EfficientNetB3`?\r\n\r\nNote: I am using two parallel networks and these parameters are the sum of both network's parameters.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/102/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
