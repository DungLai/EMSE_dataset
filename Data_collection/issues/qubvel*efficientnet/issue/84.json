Or should I completely skip it?\r\n\r\nI've tested and trained a model with the preprocess logic from the `preprocess_input` method added and it produces better initial results. \r\nWithout it, in training, it looks stuck at < 0.01 training accuracy and it does not seem to go past it.\r\nWith it, 15% in the current epoch it's around 0.45 acc. (one downside is that it slows down 3-4 times the training)\r\nNot that relevant as this is training but still. It looks that it's moving something.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"etudor","id":5428842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Mjg4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5428842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor","html_url":"https://github.com/etudor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etudor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
