I trained a model in pure Keras (2.2.4) + TF v1.14.0. Using **tensorflowjs_converter** command line tool, I was able to convert the model to TF.js without any issues. However, when I try to do inference in TF.js, it is giving me two errors, swish activation function not implemented, and FixedDropout layer not implemented. I have implemented a custom swish layer in TF.js according to your code. However, I'm not too sure about **FixedDropout**.\r\n\r\nAccording to your code, it says\r\n```\r\n\"\"\"Wrapper over custom dropout. Fix problem of ``None`` shape for tf.keras.\r\n    It is not possible to define FixedDropout class as global object,\r\n    because we do not have modules for inheritance at first time.\r\n    Issue:\r\n        https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/30946\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems it is just fixing some shape issue for tf.keras. Can I just subclass FixedDropout from Dropout in TensorFlow.js **without overwriting the forward/call function**?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
