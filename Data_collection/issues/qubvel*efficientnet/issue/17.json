But using EfficientNetB3 batchsize per GPU is no more than 12. I also print(model.summary()) to show num of  parameters.ResNet50 is 23,000,000+, EfficientNetB3 is 10,000,000+.\r\nSo,obviously,EfficientNetB3's parameters is about half the size of the ResNet50.However,i can only set batchsize to 8 or 12.This make me confused.\r\nMy GPU is Tesla P100 -16G mem","closed_by":{"login":"qubvel","id":31920396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTIwMzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31920396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
