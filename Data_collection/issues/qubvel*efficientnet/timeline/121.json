First of all, there is an error when calculating the `drop_rate` [here](https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/e9fdd43857785fe5ccf3863915dcaf618b86849f/efficientnet/model.py#L368). The default value of `drop_connect_rate` will return a drop_rate of 1. You can get around this by calling efficientnetL2 with the parameter `drop_connect_rate=0.05`. However, there will be new errors when the weights for L2 are downloaded. \r\n\r\nIn the [weights file](https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/e9fdd43857785fe5ccf3863915dcaf618b86849f/efficientnet/weights.py#L5), there is no key for `efficientnet-l2`. Checking the reference to the [weights download release](https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/releases/tag/v0.0.1), you can see that there is indeed no weights for L2. \r\n\r\nBasically, EfficientNetL2 does not seem to be implemented, nor are there weights for it yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/655799019/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kd2718","id":9621710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjE3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9621710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718","html_url":"https://github.com/kd2718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kd2718/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/818448246","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/121#issuecomment-818448246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/121","id":818448246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODQ0ODI0Ng==","user":{"login":"ucb-pb","id":56403009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDAzMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56403009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb","html_url":"https://github.com/ucb-pb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucb-pb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T05:29:00Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T05:29:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What's the error involving `drop_rate`?
