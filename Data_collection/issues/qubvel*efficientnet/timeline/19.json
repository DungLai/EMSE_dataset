for your reply!\r\n\r\nI found my mistake. I was reading the checkpoint files directly using `tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow.NewCheckpointReader` and used the final weights for the variables. In contrast, `tf.train.Saver.restore` uses the *exponential moving average* of the weights, which are also stored in the checkpoint. Using these, I achieve the reported accuracies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/502634414/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2417203833,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQxNzIwMzgzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/events/2417203833","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-17T10:53:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
