my opinion, this is a bug in `tf.keras`. I compared the implementation of the Dropout layer with that of `keras` and found that `tf.keras` does not replace `None`-valued dimensions with the actual batch size. `keras` does this in [`keras.layers.Dropout._get_noise_shape`](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/core.py#L110):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _get_noise_shape(self, inputs):\r\n    if self.noise_shape is None:\r\n        return self.noise_shape\r\n\r\n    symbolic_shape = K.shape(inputs)\r\n    noise_shape = [symbolic_shape[axis] if shape is None else shape\r\n                   for axis, shape in enumerate(self.noise_shape)]\r\n    return tuple(noise_shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tf.keras` just leaves the dimension of the batch axis as `None`, which leads to the error.\r\n\r\nA clean fix would be to derive a custom dropout layer compatible with both frameworks, which implements the correct behaviour:\r\n```python\r\nclass Dropout(layers.Dropout):\r\n    \r\n    def _get_noise_shape(self, inputs):\r\n        \r\n        if self.noise_shape is None:\r\n            return self.noise_shape\r\n\r\n        symbolic_shape = backend.shape(inputs)\r\n        noise_shape = [symbolic_shape[axis] if shape is None else shape\r\n                       for axis, shape in enumerate(self.noise_shape)]\r\n        return tuple(noise_shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then, you need to include this layer in the `custom_objects` dictionary for de-serializing saved models.\r\n\r\nA more hacky fix, which I didn't completely test, would be to replace `noise_shape=(None, 1, 1, 1)` in the model construction code with `noise_shape=(backend.shape(x)[0], 1, 1, 1)`, but I don't like this solution and suspect that it might lead to different errors at some point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/514104187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Callidior","id":7915048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTUwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7915048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior","html_url":"https://github.com/Callidior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Callidior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/514112310","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/39#issuecomment-514112310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/39","id":514112310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDExMjMxMA==","user":{"login":"qubvel","id":31920396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTIwMzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31920396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T08:38:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T08:38:05Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks for clarification, I dont like that I have to shadow new Dropout class definition, because at first time `layers` module is None and I can not use inheritance from `layers.Layer`.
