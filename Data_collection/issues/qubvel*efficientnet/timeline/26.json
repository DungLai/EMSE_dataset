to the core of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), which is compound scaling, you scale the depth with a parameter d=α<sup>ϕ</sup>, the width with a parameter w=β<sup>ϕ</sup>, and the resolution with a parameter r=γ<sup>ϕ</sup>, where ϕ is a parameter that you specify (larger for larger nets and smaller for smaller nets), and α, β and γ are parameters that they find experimentally to be 1.2, 1.1 and 1.15, respectively.\r\n\r\nTo create a smaller model than `EfficientNetB0`, you simply choose a negative ϕ and scale the depth, width and resolution parameters of `EfficientNetB0` according to the resulting d, w and r (and then round them to an integer number).\r\n\r\nYou would have to train the smaller network from scratch, though, either on the original training dataset, or (which could perhaps give slightly better performance, but is also slightly more advanced) by doing [knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) from one of the larger models.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/comments/511847081/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krikru","id":160341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru","html_url":"https://github.com/krikru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krikru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2589796224,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU4OTc5NjIyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/events/2589796224","actor":{"login":"qubvel","id":31920396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTIwMzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31920396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qubvel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T09:16:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"moukle","id":4622472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjI0NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4622472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle","html_url":"https://github.com/moukle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moukle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-20T13:03:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T13:03:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/89","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/89/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/89/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/89/events","html_url":"https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/issues/89","id":540984734,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDA5ODQ3MzQ=","number":89,"title":"Scaling
