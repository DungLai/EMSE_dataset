I meet the same situation.\r\n\r\nI trained a model in pure Keras(2.2.4) + TF 1.15.0. For HeadPoseEstimation task, \r\nI refered to the [xiankg/HeadPoseEstimation-WHENet](https://github.com/xiankgx/HeadPoseEstimation-WHENet) as my model and attempted to convert to a TF.js model.\r\n\r\nSo the question about the FixedDropout, **Can I just subclass FixedDropout from Dropout in TensorFlow.js without overwriting the forward/call function?**, does you solve it now?\r\n\r\nAnd I'm new to TF.js, so I just wonder about the code. Can only refer the tensorflow.js official documents to deploy the code to mobile device or you use the other third party libraries available to help?\r\n\r\nThank you
