But with the same dataset and default settings,  the newest version cannot train models as good as the last version did. \r\n In the newest version, when setting freeze=true, it run well. But when setting freeze=false, the val-loss went down only for afew epoches, e.g. 4,5. I seemed like the training did not converge. \r\n\r\n  I looked through the codes, but did not find the reason yet.\r\n\r\n  There are afew differences between the newst version and before. are they the reasons?\r\n- the network strctures are different\r\n- alittle difference in yolo_loss(). \r\nthe newest version is \r\n`input_shape = tf.shape(yolo_output)[1:3] * grid_step`\r\nbut it was like\r\n`input_shape = tf.shape(yolo_output)[1:3] * 32`\r\nI made the yolo_loss same as before, but it did not work.\r\n\r\nany suggestions for this issue?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hejinIzhanghao","id":6120753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMjA3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6120753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao","html_url":"https://github.com/hejinIzhanghao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hejinIzhanghao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsx950223/mobilenetv2-yolov3/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fsx950223/mobilenetv2-yolov3/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
