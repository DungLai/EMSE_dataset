This slightly differs from the setting of uPU, which only requires ? to be slymmetric.\r\n\r\n 我的理解是您论文中的buPU模型用MAE作为损失函数，但是在代码中定义的损失函数：\r\n\r\n>     def loss_func(self, yTrue, yPred, type):\r\n>         y = torch.eye(2)[yTrue].float()\r\n>         if len(y.shape) == 1:\r\n>             y = y[None, :]\r\n>         # y = torch.from_numpy(yTrue).float().cuda()\r\n>         if type == 'bnpu' or type == 'bpu':\r\n>             loss = torch.mean((y * (1 - yPred)).sum(dim=1))\r\n>         elif type == 'upu':\r\n>             loss = torch.mean((-y * torch.log(yPred)).sum(dim=1))\r\n>         # loss = 0.5 * torch.max(1-yPred*(2.0*yTrue-1),0)\r\n>         return loss\r\n是一个0-1损失而不是MAE。\r\n求解惑，十分感谢！\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Yixan","id":25841926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODQxOTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25841926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan","html_url":"https://github.com/Yixan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yixan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/v-mipeng/LexiconNER/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/v-mipeng/LexiconNER/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
