I found this issue and I think it's slightly misleading. Torchsummary uses a forward pass to determine layer structure and calculate parameters. Hence, if there is a for loop in the forward pass there is an issue.\r\n```\r\ndef __init__: \r\n                self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(x,y,z)\r\ndef forward(self,x):\r\n                for i in range(5):\r\n                    x = self.conv1(x)\r\n```\r\nAs seen from the above snippet, I'm passing through the same layer again and again.\r\nTorchsummary in this case will say that there are 5 layers (report 5 times the parameters) instead of 1 layer being cycled again and again. \r\nAlthough this is wrong code and goes against the concept of Neural Nets being Direct Acyclic Graphs, I hope there is some sort of check  in place to ensure the correct structure of the network created and parameters counted.\r\n5 layers should only be reported when I use this:\r\n```\r\ndef __init__:\r\n        self.conv1 = nn.ModuleList([nn.Conv2d(x,y,z) for _ in range(5)])\r\ndef forward(self,x):\r\n        for i in self.conv1:\r\n               x = self.conv1(x)\r\n```\r\nHere, I've created 5 new layers and torchsummary prints the correct result but it should not print this type of result in the previous case\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"TylerYep","id":18021435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDIxNDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18021435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep","html_url":"https://github.com/TylerYep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TylerYep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T17:26:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T17:26:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/121","id":589646892,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODk2NDY4OTI=","number":121,"title":"Granular

Guys, \r\n\r\nThis is a great work, it is a very util package. \r\n\r\nI'm working with a CNN that shared weights along some branches and if I applied correctly the package, I believe there is an error when it its calculated the shared weights in a CNN. \r\n\r\nFor instance :\r\nA main model have some branches that shared weights between the branches.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36409645/81486163-41acb580-9253-11ea-9463-1d62a6065b26.png)\r\n\r\nMy branch has only two conv2d and two Leaky-ReLU. It defines well the num of parameters to be learned as expected. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36409645/81486349-871db280-9254-11ea-999a-1076ef9a0fff.png)\r\n\r\nBut, when I defined the whole model (Shared) I believe that there is some error in the number of the parameters to be learned. I believed it is adding the number of parameters as the number of branches defined.

never received write access to this project and, based on the implementation, am not too enthusiastic about handling backwards-incompatible changes in the new rewrite. Simply releasing a new version without a proper plan could break existing code in over 1400 codebases (based on GitHub). Additionally, torch-summary has deviated enough that I no longer regard it as a fork of this project - there is almost no overlap in code anymore.\r\n\r\nI would recommend using my version if you want bug fixes and slightly more maintainability for the foreseeable future.
