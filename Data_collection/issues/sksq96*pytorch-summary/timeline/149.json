I'm not really sure what version of the code you're running, but it doesn't seem to be the version from [the PR I opened](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/pull/150) (or master for that matter). I think, you identified the line where the error occurs correctly, but your stack message indicates it's at line 88. However, this code can be found at [line 94 on master](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/blob/master/torchsummary/torchsummary.py#L94), and has been outright replaced by [lines 97-102 in my PR](https://github.com/nathanpainchaud/pytorch-summary/blob/fix/layer_dict_output/torchsummary/torchsummary.py#L97-L102).\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I suspect something is up with your version of the torchsummary package installed in your environment, and I'd make sure you have installed the version from my PR. You should be able to do this easily with pip:\r\n```shell script\r\npip install
