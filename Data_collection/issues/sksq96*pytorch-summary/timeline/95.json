contribution introduces three mayor changes:\r\n\r\n1. Parameters are now counted using the `parameters()` function of `nn.Module` and the `numel()` function of the `nn.parameters.Parameter`. This allows for counting the weights of custom modules with other keywords than just `weight` or `bias`. The fix addresses issues [#95](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/95) and [#65](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/65) .\r\n2. Trainable parameters are now counted on a separate accumulator using the `requires_grad` attribute of parameters.\r\n3. The API is expanded by adding a parameter `recurse` both to `summary()` and `summary_string()`, which is `True` by default.\r\nIf set, the summary string will only be built for direct children of the model (and the model module itself).\r\n\r\nThe API extension and the parameter counting fix have both been tested through additional tests that are now included in `torchsummary_test.py`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
