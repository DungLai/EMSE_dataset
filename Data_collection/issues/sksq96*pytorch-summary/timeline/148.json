Update report\r\n\r\n1. Fix the bug of parameter number calculation when there are more than one output variables, including both sequence case and dict case (mentioned in #162).\r\n2. Make multiple output variables split into multiple lines.\r\n3. Remove the last line break of `summary_string()`.\r\n4. Enable argument `device` to accept both str and `torch.device`.\r\n5. Fix a bug when the model requires `batch_size` to be a specific number.\r\n6. Fix a bug caused by multiple input cases when `dtypes=None`.\r\n7. Add text auto wrap when the layer name is too long.\r\n8. Support counting all parameters instead of `weight` and `bias` (a different solution of #142, #148).\r\n9. Drop the `np.sum/prod` to fix the overflow problem during calculating the total size (mentioned in #158).\r\n10. Fix the bug caused by layers with dict input values (mentioned in #162).\r\n11.
