everyone for your comments and answers. I agree with @skmatz there not much one can do other than adapt the model's code. The package is just built on top of pytorch and one has to work with the tools they give you... I confirm that the problem effectively lies in having a  double `self` assignment of the model's parts in the `__init__()`.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by @Naireen, this works: \r\n\r\n``` \r\nclass Model(nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super(Model,self).__init__()\r\n\r\n        K = 69\r\n        L = 1000\r\n        self._features = nn.Sequential(\r\n            nn.Sequential(\r\n                nn.Conv3d(3, K, kernel_size=3,padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n                nn.LeakyReLU()\r\n            )\r\n            nn.Sequential(\r\n                nn.Conv3d(K, L, kernel_size=4, padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n                nn.MaxPool3d(2, stride=2,ceil_mode=True),\r\n                nn.ReLU()\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def forward(self,x):\r\n        out = self._features(x)\r\n        return out\r\n```\r\nAlternatively this also works: \r\n```\r\nclass Model(nn.Module):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n\r\n        super(Model,self).__init__()\r\n\r\n        K = 69\r\n        L = 1000\r\n\r\n        self.group1 = nn.Sequential(\r\n            nn.Conv3d(3, K, kernel_size=3,padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n            nn.LeakyReLU()\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        self.group2 = nn.Sequential(\r\n            nn.Conv3d(K, L, kernel_size=4, padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n            nn.MaxPool3d(2, stride=2,ceil_mode=True),\r\n            nn.ReLU()\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def forward(self,x):\r\n        out = self.group1(x)\r\n        out = self.group2(out)\r\n        return out\r\n```\r\nHowever, this doesn't work (prints double) because you have the two groups of elements (the \"groups\" and the \"features\") in the `__init__` with one nested into the other and they seem to both call the `hook` at initialization:\r\n```\r\nclass Model(nn.Module):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n\r\n        super(Model,self).__init__()\r\n\r\n        K = 69\r\n        L = 1000\r\n\r\n        self.group1 = nn.Sequential(\r\n            nn.Conv3d(3, K, kernel_size=3,padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n            nn.LeakyReLU()\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        self.group2 = nn.Sequential(\r\n            nn.Conv3d(K, L, kernel_size=4, padding=(1,1,1)),\r\n            nn.MaxPool3d(2, stride=2,ceil_mode=True),\r\n            nn.ReLU()\r\n        )\r\n\r\n        self._features = nn.Sequential(\r\n            self.group1,\r\n            self.group2\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def forward(self,x):\r\n        out = self._features(x)\r\n        return
