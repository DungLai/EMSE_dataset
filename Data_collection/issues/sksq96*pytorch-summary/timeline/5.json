think @gasvn advice is great.\r\nThis package can be extended in more general case.\r\nIn the function of summary, the inputs will be created automatically.\r\nAfter the inputs are generated, the hook will record the information of each layer.\r\nHowever, this design idea might limit the generalization.\r\nMaybe ask the user to give the input is another approach.\r\nBecause the function just check the information of layer,\r\nthe correctness of tensor is not necessary. \r\nThe user can just give the random value.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.autograd import Variable\r\nfrom model import MyNetwork\r\nimport torch.nn as nn\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nb, c, h, w = 32, 1, 28, 28\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    input_1 = Variable(torch.from_numpy(np.random.random([b, c, h, w])).float())\r\n    input_2 = Variable(torch.from_numpy(np.random.random([b, c, h, w])).long())\r\n    model = MyNetwork()\r\n    summary(model, input_list = [input_1, input_2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code shows my suggestion.\r\nFor example, `MyNetwork` is the custom network which has two input.\r\nThe type of first one is the variable which contains float tensor,\r\nand the second one is the variable which contains long tensor.\r\nThis mechanism can allow the network to be more flexible!!!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/386935660/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SunnerLi","id":11500871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTAwODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11500871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi","html_url":"https://github.com/SunnerLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunnerLi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1612006209,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYxMjAwNjIwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/events/1612006209","actor":{"login":"gasvn","id":20515144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE1MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20515144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn","html_url":"https://github.com/gasvn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-07T01:47:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1612006210,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MTIwMDYyMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/events/1612006210","actor":{"login":"gasvn","id":20515144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE1MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20515144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn","html_url":"https://github.com/gasvn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gasvn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-07T01:47:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/421217758","html_url":"https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/5#issuecomment-421217758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/5","id":421217758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTIxNzc1OA==","user":{"login":"sksq96","id":8557728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8557728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96","html_url":"https://github.com/sksq96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sksq96/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T03:12:41Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T03:12:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Support
