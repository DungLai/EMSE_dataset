In your previous posts, you have not mentioned any batch with a batch size of `1`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do not understand\r\n\r\n> I don't see '2' as batch size.\r\n\r\neither. Because you have mentioned that your output is\r\n\r\n```python\r\nDECODER\r\ntorch.Size([2, 2, 2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy do you say you do not see `2` as batch size? It is clear that the first element of the returned shape is `2`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere is a tip: if your are using\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntorchsummary.summary(..., input_size=...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should not let your `input_size` become something like `[3, 28, 28]`. That would cause errors. Instead, you should use `((3, 28, 28), )` or `(3, 28, 28)`. The official implementation is quite unstable in some cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/800950150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cainmagi","id":32186723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTg2NzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32186723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi","html_url":"https://github.com/cainmagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cainmagi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/824029608","html_url":"https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/168#issuecomment-824029608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/168","id":824029608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDAyOTYwOA==","user":{"login":"letsgo247","id":31367230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzY3MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31367230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247","html_url":"https://github.com/letsgo247","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letsgo247/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-21T12:42:45Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T12:42:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cainmagi Thanks!
