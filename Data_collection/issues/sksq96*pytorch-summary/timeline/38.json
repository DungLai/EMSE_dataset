If you pass a tuple as ```input_size``` as in README, this line makes it nested and ```torch.rand``` works. You probably used a list and encountered this error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/450530698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ozen","id":16025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen","html_url":"https://github.com/ozen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
