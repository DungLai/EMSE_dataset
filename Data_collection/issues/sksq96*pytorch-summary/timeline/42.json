I also encountered same issue and as a hack, I changed the data type of tensor in the forward method where I am calling embedding module to long just for testing purpose. It worked for me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/678665304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikhilkarnwal","id":6325375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjUzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6325375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal","html_url":"https://github.com/nikhilkarnwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilkarnwal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/comments/814568783","html_url":"https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/42#issuecomment-814568783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/42","id":814568783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDU2ODc4Mw==","user":{"login":"santteegt","id":926341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/926341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt","html_url":"https://github.com/santteegt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santteegt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T03:12:45Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T03:12:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"to

I would like to know if there is any easy way i can obtain a summary of a pykeen model, similar to what keras summary function does (list number of  parameters, number of trainable parameters, non-trainable parameters, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\nSince i couldn't seem to find anything in the docs, I tried to use 2 external packages (listed bellow) in order to obtain such functionality but nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\n### [torchsummary](https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary)\r\n\r\nThis package has issues dealing with  nn.Embedding  https://github.com/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/42, and is at the moment still an open issue.\r\n\r\n### [torchsummaryX ](https://github.com/nmhkahn/torchsummaryX) \r\n\r\nI also tried torchsummaryX  wich was proposed in the issue thread of the library above as an alternative, however its seems like it internally calls model.forward() wich with pykeen's  Models raises an  NotImplementedError\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfrom pykeen.datasets import Nations\r\ndataset = Nations()\r\ntraining_triples_factory = dataset.training\r\n\r\nfrom pykeen.models import TransE\r\ntranse_mod = TransE(triples_factory=training_triples_factory, embedding_dim=10)\r\n\r\ntranse_mod.forward()\r\n```\r\nGives error:\r\n> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n> <ipython-input-17-a16fd01968b2> in <module>()\r\n> ----> 1 transe_mod.forward()\r\n> \r\n> /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py in

    203 \r\n> \r\n> NotImplementedError: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI would like to ask you, if you know of any way I can do something like this. It is of course not a crucial feature (since i can calculate \"by hand\" this statistics), but it is something nice to have especially when implementing a new model (in order to easily compare its complexity with others).\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRodrigo Pereira","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pykeen/pykeen/issues/563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pykeen/pykeen/issues/563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
