I'm finding it very useful so far.\r\n\r\nThe one issue I'm having is that I'm unsure how to pass `input_size` for a 1d input. So if, for example, I want to run `summary()` on a simple feed-forward network with 512 input features, how would this be done? So far I've tried `input_size=(512)`, `input_size=(1, 512)`, `input_size=(1, 1, 512)`, `input_size=(512, 1)` and `input_size=(512, 1, 1)` all of which result in errors. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something simple here? Or is the 1d use-case just not supported at this point?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
