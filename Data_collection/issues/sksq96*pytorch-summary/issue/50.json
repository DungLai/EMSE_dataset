Maybe the easiest fix is to set model.eval() before forward pass and then set it back to whatever value it was.\r\n\r\nSo for those who are getting worse results after loading model than before saving - If you need to use it, use it before loading weights to model.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/50/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
