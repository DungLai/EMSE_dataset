It defines well the num of parameters to be learned as expected. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36409645/81486349-871db280-9254-11ea-999a-1076ef9a0fff.png)\r\n\r\nBut, when I defined the whole model (Shared) I believe that there is some error in the number of the parameters to be learned. I believed it is adding the number of parameters as the number of branches defined. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36409645/81486293-078fe380-9254-11ea-9679-27be3c879214.png)\r\n\r\nCan you please check this or maybe I am missing something. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nLuis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
