Thanks!\r\n\r\nBy the way, I wonder you have any plan to support interface for **returning concatenated string of summary result**, instead of directly printing the summary to console.\r\n\r\nI want to print the summary information to the log using the python `logging` feature, but the `summary` function just print the result to the console directly, so I cannot provide the summary result to my logger. If the interface is provided, I think this package would be more helpful.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Naireen","id":13244787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ0Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13244787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen","html_url":"https://github.com/Naireen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naireen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/99/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sksq96/pytorch-summary/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
