Thanks for your great work.\r\nI built a U-net model and used torch-summary to check the GPU memory. When I used BN(Batch Normalization), it cost about 1.8G. But when I used GN(Group Normalization), it cost about 2.2G. When the ipunt is bigger, the difference of the GPU memory will also become bigger. But the problem is, pytorch-summary gave the same costs as below:\r\n\r\nBN:(using: torch.nn.BatchNorm2d)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31624867/57195058-a8ccc580-6f80-11e9-8fcc-b06d2302a168.png)\r\n\r\nGN:(using: torch.nn.GroupNorm)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31624867/57195062-b71ae180-6f80-11e9-8c2c-b7e07f78e44b.png)\r\n\r\nThat is the only difference between my code.
