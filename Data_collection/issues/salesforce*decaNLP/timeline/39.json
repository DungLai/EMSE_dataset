You should be able to skip the docker build command now, and instead just use bmccann/decanlp:cuda9_torch041 for the code on the master branch. If you don't have CUDA, then you can simply remove the cuda9_ from the docker image tag.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/comments/433235010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1927570866,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkyNzU3MDg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/events/1927570866","actor":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-25T23:09:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
