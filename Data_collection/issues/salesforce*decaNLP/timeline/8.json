Thanks for pointing out this use case. \r\n\r\n2) you should no longer need to do this on master because all mentions of runtime should be converted to decaNLP. Let me know if not. If you’ve already downloaded the data to some location called runtime, you can move the .data directory in runtime to decaNLP/ to line up with master. \r\n\r\n3) agreed. I’ll add some info to the readme and a better description in arguments.py\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/comments/400758788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/comments/400844850","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/8#issuecomment-400844850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/8","id":400844850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDg0NDg1MA==","user":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T22:08:24Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T22:08:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"97181e99e9a5a41798b0a9a49b8b5e24c9b2c343 should help with this.\r\n\r\n1) You can now pass --no_commit if you don't want to have the dependency on .git\r\n3) I changed the README examples to use `--gpu` instead of `--gpus`.
