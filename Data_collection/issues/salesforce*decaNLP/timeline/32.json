The question should be “What is the summary?”. And the answer should be the expected summary. If you don’t have an answer in mind, then you can just use a dummy sequence for the answer for now. This will both print out all the predictions and write them to a file as described in the readme.\r\n\r\nIf you want to run the model on the validation or test splits of cnn/dailymail though, you don’t need to worry about all that. Just look at the example in the readme for running inference with predict.py and add the —tasks cnn_dailymail argument.
