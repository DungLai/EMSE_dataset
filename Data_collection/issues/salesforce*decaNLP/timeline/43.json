Then you can use the instructions from the Custom Inference section of the README.\r\n\r\nFor fine-tuning, you can actually do the same thing, but use the commands for training from the README instead of the commands for inference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/comments/439500841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2092896132,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA5Mjg5NjEzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/events/2092896132","actor":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-23T21:33:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
