I have 2 jsonl files, train.jsonl and val.jsonl as suggested.\r\n\r\nA sample line from my dataset is {\"context\": \"no, i just need to make sure it's cheap. oh, and i need parking\", \"question\": \"What is the change in state?\", \"answer\": \"name: not mentioned, area: not mentioned, parking: yes, pricerange: cheap, stars: not mentioned, internet: not mentioned, type: hotel;\"}\r\n\r\nThis should be the correct format for the dataset training tuple. The problem is when I run the training process, when it tries to run validation after 1000 iterations (--val_every 1000), the output for the answer is always \"o\".
