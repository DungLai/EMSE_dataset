But what I'm confused is that the answer is fed into the model for computing answer representation mentioned in the paper. Why is this? Aren't the answers unknown in testing phase?\r\n\r\nBy the way, there's a typo in your paper. In equation (10), the ℝ^n for p_c should be ℝ^*l*. Right?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"bmccann","id":3359909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3359909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/bmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmccann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/decaNLP/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
