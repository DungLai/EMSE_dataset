It's how many sequences you will batch together to perform a single gradient update. Usually 32/64/128/256/512.\r\n- `time_dim` or `timesteps` is the number of steps you have in your sequences. \r\n- `input_dim` is the dimension of each data point for any given step.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to care about how the TCN works internally, especially if you are a novice in ML. You can easily switch between TCN, LSTM and GRU.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/1107781561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6485491211,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB4a3hs5FhbFuzwAAAAGCkL4L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/6485491211","actor":{"login":"qq492947833","id":81745297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzQ1Mjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81745297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833","html_url":"https://github.com/qq492947833","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T07:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6485491212,"node_id":"SE_lADOB4a3hs5FhbFuzwAAAAGCkL4M","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/6485491212","actor":{"login":"qq492947833","id":81745297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzQ1Mjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81745297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833","html_url":"https://github.com/qq492947833","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T07:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6485494004,"node_id":"LE_lADOB4a3hs5FhbFuzwAAAAGCkMj0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/6485494004","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-24T07:44:15Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6485494005,"node_id":"LE_lADOB4a3hs5Fhb

The bigger the LSTM/RNN is, the more memory it will have. Which means the further in the sequence it can remember. But most LSTM/RNN can't remember more than 50 steps back in time (by construction, the gradient propagation somehow vanishes a bit at every step, look for BPTT, a [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient)-based technique for training certain types of [recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)).\r\n\r\nWith TCN you can control how far the network can see in time. It's called the receptive field. And because TCN has dilated convolutions, the information coming far in the sequence can be recovered very quickly.\r\n\r\nIn practice your receptive field should always be bigger than the length of your biggest sequence. Otherwise the TCN will not see the entire sequence to make its prediction.\r\n\r\nThe number of timesteps is defined by your data. It's given by your `input_shape`. The TCN does not have control on that. The receptive field is given by the input parameters of your TCN (in the init) and you can control them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/1107944164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6486560558,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB4a3hs5FhbFuzwAAAAGCoQ8u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/6486560558","actor":{"login":"qq492947833","id":81745297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzQ1Mjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81745297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833","html_url":"https://github.com/qq492947833","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-25T00:02:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6486560562,"node_id":"SE_lADOB4a3hs5FhbFuzwAAAAGCoQ8y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/6486560562","actor":{"login":"qq492947833","id":81745297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzQ1Mjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81745297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833","html_url":"https://github.com/qq492947833","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-25T00:02:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/1113975944","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/227#issuecomment-1113975944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/227","id":1113975944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB4a3hs5CZeyI","user":{"login":"qq492947833","id":81745297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzQ1Mjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81745297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833","html_url":"https://github.com/qq492947833","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qq492947833/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-30T11:57:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T11:57:59Z","
