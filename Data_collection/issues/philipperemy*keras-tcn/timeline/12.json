They wonâ€™t be the same, but should have similar effects in stabilizing training.\r\n\r\nYou cannot place weight normalization after ReLU because it normalizes the cell weights, as the name suggested, not the cell output.\r\n\r\nAs the author of the paper stated, this TCN architecture really aims to be a simple baseline that you can improve upon. So personally I think replicating the exact same results is not that important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/418573348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1826698795,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgyNjY5ODc5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/1826698795","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T01:52:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
