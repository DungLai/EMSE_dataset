I forgot a bit how `Bidirectional` works. Is it concatenating the outputs at each step from two RNNs going forward and backwards? Does it involve \"merging\" the states (cells) when doing that (I don't think so but just asking)? Because TCN don't have states compared to GRU or LSTM.\r\n\r\nIf it's just concatenating outputs at each step where each TCN is independent, then it's def do-able. And it would not be so hard. I guess we can just do:\r\n- We need to add `go_backwards` in the constructor.\r\n- If `go_backwards=True`, we need to flip the time dimension before the TCN layers are called.\r\n- `return_state` could just be an empty
