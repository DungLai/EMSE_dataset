thanks for helping and replying to Ding. I can add a few more things.\r\n@dingfengqian Your input_dim dimension (5) example is similar to the case of an RGB image with 3 channels processed by a 2D convolution. Here we don't have 2D Conv-s but 1D Conv because we drop width and height and we just consider the time dimension. But the logic is the same.\r\n\r\n**So yes there will be some interactions.** It is definitely not the case where we fetch one by one the input dimensions and run the TCN one each of them. There is no `for i in range(5) do` in the code. Inside the hood (inside the convolutional layers), you will find some matrices that will map input_dim to nb_filters (the ouput_dim of the convolution). So if you set nb_filters=64, you will find somewhere a matrix 5x64 (I omitted the kernel_size for clarity. If you consider kernel_size=3, then the matrix of your conv1D will be of shape 3x5x64).\r\n\r\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT ANY INTERACTIONS: then, push the input_dim in the batch dimension, and run your TCN with input_dim=1. If you have (None, 10, 5), reshape it to (None * 5, 10, 1), call TCN on layer, obtain (None * 5, 1) [assuming it's a regression problem], and reshape it again to a list of 5 elements of shape (None, 1).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d (for RGB channels)\r\n- https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv1d (what we use inside
