Try to reduce the number of filters and/or reduce the dilations to match the number of parameters of your LSTM. Keep in mind that LSTM usually fail to remember more than 50 steps. So if your sequence is 1000 steps, you can build a TCN that can remember the last ~100 steps. It -of course- depends on the type of your data. But that could be something you can consider. Hope it helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/539854052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2697798734,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY5Nzc5ODczNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/2697798734","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-09T06:21:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/540557278","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/77#issuecomment-540557278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/77","id":540557278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDU1NzI3OA==","user":{"login":"RifqiAW","id":11531966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMxOTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11531966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW","html_url":"https://github.com/RifqiAW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RifqiAW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-10T12:45:54Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T12:45:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I just realized that in my previous project I used a bidirectional LSTM, hence why I couldn't replicate the result with a causal tcn.
