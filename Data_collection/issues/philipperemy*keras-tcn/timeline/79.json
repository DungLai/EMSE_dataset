The first 0:1000 steps go in your X and step 1000 go in your Y. And then you increment by 1. You are now at time 1001. The last 1000 (so from 1 to 1001 excluded) go to your X and the step 1001 go in your Y.\r\n\r\nThen you're going to have two big matrices X and Y of the shape:\r\n\r\nX.shape = (num_samples = 3000-1000 = 2000, 1000, 3)\r\nY.shape = (num_samples, 1, 2)\r\n\r\nThen you can just run TCN+Dense(2) like you would use a simple LSTM.\r\n\r\nYou can check this script.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/blob/master/tasks/time_series_forecasting.py\r\n\r\nIt's just with one feature. In your case you will have 3.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/540867304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2704698406,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcwNDY5ODQwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/2704698406","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-11T01:59:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
