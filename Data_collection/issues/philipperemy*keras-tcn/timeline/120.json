You have three main options:\r\n- use batch size of 1. https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/blob/master/tasks/multi_length_sequences.py\r\n- bucket the sequences of same length and batch them together. For example one batch of length 10, one batch of length 12, one batch of length 100.\r\n- pad with 0 or a neutral number (mean of signal for example).\r\n\r\nAnother one -like you mentioned- is to alter your data to downsample it which I don't really recommend but I would have to see the data first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/598175665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3122756560,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEyMjc1NjU2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/3122756560","actor":{"login":"theDweeb","id":28876054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODc2MDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28876054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb","html_url":"https://github.com/theDweeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T13:08:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3122756562,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMjI3NTY1NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/3122756562","actor":{"login":"theDweeb","id":28876054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODc2MDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28876054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb","html_url":"https://github.com/theDweeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theDweeb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T13:08:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/598176350","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/120#issuecomment-598176350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/120","id":598176350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODE3NjM1MA==","user":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T13:10:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T13:10:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","bo
