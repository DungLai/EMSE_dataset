Even though all TCN implementations discuss the relationship between real-time and causal convolution, there is no such real-time version. I find the implementation is really challenging but it is possible in theory. The main concern is the efficiency since the whole sequence input can take advantage of parallelism but the one-by-one input design has less parallelism.
