Adding skip_connections sums the outputs over many layers. We can always add 1x1 conv to match the outputs of all the layers? Or have dense layers? For example if I have filters=[10,20,30], we can probably consider the biggest filter size (30) and consider the transformations 10->30 and 20->30. That would result in additional weights. Let me know what would be the best way to address this.

thanks for your answer!\r\nI found a way to build the architecture as I wanted to, based on that:\r\nhttps://www.programmersought.com/article/13674618779/\r\n\r\nAlso, I might be a bit confuse about what skip_connections is exactly doing. \r\nSo here is a quick explanation of what I did -> my own translation of the pytorch code I want to replicate, based on the previous link, and maybe two elements of solutions.\r\n\r\nBasically, this is a sequence to sequence model, with a given number of Residual Blocks (One per dilation). Each block having a given number of filters and kernel size.\r\n\r\nAfter several Residual blocks (example: 4 if dilation=[1,2,4,8]), the output need to be back to the dimension of the output sequence. This is done with 2 Conv1DTranspose layers.\r\n\r\n1. What I have in mind is adding the initial input sequence to the output of the residual blocks, just before the Conv1DTranspose layers.\r\nTo do so, I just used the Concatenate layer from tf.keras.\r\n\r\n2. A residual block is the succession of 2 Conv1D layers. Within a residual block, a variable called shortcut is used to concatenate the result from the 2 Conv1D layers with the input of the residual block.\r\nIf the shapes of the input of the residual block and the output are different, they use a conv1D layer with the appropriate number of filters and kernel_size directly on the input before concatenation of both (add layer).\r\nI guess that's where you are thinking of the 1*1 conv layer?\r\n\r\nI'm now not sure that my step 1. is necessary as the information might already been taken into account by the shortcut variable within a residual block.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm not too confusing in my explanation! \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/753886206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"user4325","id":25684140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Njg0MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25684140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325","html_url":"https://github.com/user4325","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/user4325/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4335316551,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQzMzUzMTY1NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/4335316551","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-16T09:58:19Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/963555661","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/170#issuecomment-963555661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/170","id":963555661,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB4a3hs45brFN","user":{"login":"loySoGxj","id":70319365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzE5MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70319365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj","html_url":"https://github.com/loySoGxj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loySoGxj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T20:41:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T20:41:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looking at the above url, it looks like a mixture of non-causal TCN and TCN.
