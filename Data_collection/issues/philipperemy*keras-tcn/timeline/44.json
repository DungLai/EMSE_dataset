Your data must be big and your model deep.\r\n\r\nYes the model is a bit different. Its internal structure is slightly different. You can compare both models in terms of numbers of parameters and adjust the new model to have roughly the same number of parameters as the old one. It's possible that the new model has less weights for the same configuration. So that could definitely explain the small performance drop.\r\n\r\nThe old implementation was using a different first conv layer, normed Relu activations with one conv per residual block. The new one (the one from the paper) uses just Relu with 2 conv per residual block.\r\n\r\nPlease keep me

data so I moved it to my code and used TCN function after that.\r\n\r\nI find this repository very useful and I would only suggest not to limit the code to the paper but provide other extensions such as attention mechanism on top of tcn, in addition, to the paper implementation. Example:\r\n\r\ntcn.py paper implementation.\r\ntcn_attension.py example of extending tcn to use attention mechanism.\r\n\r\nYou may now close the question\r\n\r\nThank you  very much philipperemy for the useful repository \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/473840609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HighPerformance01","id":19373469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzczNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19373469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01","html_url":"https://github.com/HighPerformance01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HighPerformance01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/474152630","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/44#issuecomment-474152630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/44","id":474152630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDE1MjYzMA==","user":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-19T00:31:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T00:31:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@HighPerformance01 ,\r\n\r\nThat's fantastic!
