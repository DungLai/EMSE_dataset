I'm trying to build a autoencoder using TCN. In my encoder part, the TCN will not return a sequence. After looking at your code, it seems to me that if return sequence is set to False, then only one slice in the last layer is kept for output. However, the convolution is still conducted for other slices. Tracing back the dilated convolution, many computations that only affect the discarded slices is wasted. I'm not sure if I understand it correctly. If not, please kindly point out.\r\n\r\nYes you understood correctly. Almost all the computations will be lost. It's the same case for RNN models. But I agree that those computations could be avoided for this case.\r\n\r\n> I also have a question in building the decoder. I'm not sure if I should use a identical dilation order in the TCN group of layers as in the encoder, or should reverse the dilation order. This is a general question not very related to the implementation of TCN itself so you can ignore it if you'd like to. Any comment/suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThat's more of a research question. In this case, I would say deconvolution are probably better than convolutional layers since you want to upsample. So TCN might not be the best here. We should build a temporal de-convolutional layer network

TCN fans,\r\n\r\nRecently I'm trying to use TCN to achieve some forecasting works, and it works pretty well. I just have one question regarding the TCN training. As mentioned in the introduction document, one advantage of the TCN model is that it can be trained in parallel, because in each layer the kernels are the same and there is no sequential waiting issues like LSTM and RNN. My question is, such parallel training is achieved automatically by the existing code, or should be set up mannually by some additional codes?\r\n\r\nThanks, much appreciate!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
