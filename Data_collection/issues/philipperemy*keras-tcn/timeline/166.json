If I can draw a parallel with a simple ConvNet, it would be your color channel (dim = 3). Each dim here is independent.\r\n\r\nThe input is (batch_size, time_steps, input_dim) and the time dimension is unrolled.\r\n\r\nIn your case height is the input_dim and 259 is your time_steps (which is big enough so you should benefit from the advantage of the TCN. If not, might have to tune it a bit or maybe because the information further from a distance of 50 steps is not relevant for the predictions!).\r\n\r\nAs a summary: give a tensor of shape (20, 259, 50) to the TCN and it should work! I think that's what you're already doing.\r\n\r\n> does it mean that my image is broken into 50 different 1D arrays or is something else happening?\r\nSomehow yes. you can refer to this doc for more info: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv1d. 50 is your `in_channels` variable in this doc. You just increase your filters in the second dimension, which is like considering them independently (if I'm right).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/706812623/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/707161331","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/166#issuecomment-707161331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/166","id":707161331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzE2MTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"puneat","id":32441618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQxNjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32441618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat","html_url":"https://github.com/puneat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T14:39:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T14:39:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That clears it up!
