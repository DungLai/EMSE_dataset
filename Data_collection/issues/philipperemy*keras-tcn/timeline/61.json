a thought, maybe we can create it as a `Sequential` object instead of a layer? Personally, I prefer the functional API, but this would allow us to automatically capture the trainable weights of the child layers by adding them to `self.layers` (and it also allows for easy layer access).\r\n\r\nPer the [docs](https://keras.io/layers/containers/) here it says:\r\n> The Sequential container is a linear stack of layers. Apart from the `add` methods and the `layers` constructor argument, the API is identical to that of the `Layer` class.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n**Edit**:  \r\n\r\nI did a bit of digging and it appears that there's a discrepancy between how `keras` and `tensorflow.keras` handle nested layers. The note stating that Keras tracks layers assigned as attributes only applies to the tensorflow version of Keras and not the original.\r\n\r\n`keras.layers.Layer.trainable_weights`:\r\nhttps://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/29f27f333efb427830e62bec62fd79b444df4011/keras/engine/base_layer.py#L192\r\n\r\n`tf.keras.layers.Layer.trainable_weights`: \r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2bb4f008ff48630dd516a637232ade00ffd018cf/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py#L812\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2bb4f008ff48630dd516a637232ade00ffd018cf/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py#L2190\r\n\r\n`tensorflow.keras` tracks nested layers using the `_layers` attribute. It appears that o.g. Keras does a very similar thing inside its `Network` class (which is the underlying logic for `Model`, without the training stuff). \r\n\r\n`keras.engine.Network`:\r\nhttps://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/ed07472bc5fc985982db355135d37059a1f887a9/keras/engine/network.py#L469\r\n\r\nSo depending on which implementation of Keras you want to roll with (tf or o.g.), it looks like we can either build off of the tensorflow keras `Layer` class, or the keras `Network` class. \r\n\r\nIn both cases, we just need to add all layers to the `_layers` attribute in order for their `trainable_weights` to be tracked.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/510977432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"beasteers","id":6741720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDE3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6741720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers","html_url":"https://github.com/beasteers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beasteers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/536232230","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/61#issuecomment-536232230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/61","id":536232230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjIzMjIzMA==","user":{"login":"psomers3","id":37300408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzAwNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37300408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3","html_url":"https://github.com/psomers3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psomers3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-28T23:11:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T23:11:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I didn't realize that this was already being discussed.

Loading these with the command \r\n`model.load_weights('weights/model.hdf5', by_name=True)` works fine for the old setup, while loading that model in the new setup gives unexpected results. It doesn't give an error when loading, but upon inference the accuracy on the new setup is always 0.\r\n\r\nKind
