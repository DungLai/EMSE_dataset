If we also want to support tf.keras, I think another great place we can put it on for more visibility is [tensorflow addons](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons). @philipperemy may I help out with porting the tcn layer portion of the code to [tensorflow.addons.layers](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/master/tensorflow_addons/layers/README.md)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/549171242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shun-lin","id":16867893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODY3ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16867893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/shun-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shun-lin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2766173010,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2NjE3MzAxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/2766173010","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-03T19:42:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2766173011,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjYxNzMwMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/events/2766173011","actor":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-03T19:42:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/comments/549223485","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/73#issuecomment-549223485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/73","id":549223485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTIyMzQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/recei

the feature and the current behavior/state.**\r\n\r\nThe feature is for adding the different layers introduced in [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271.pdf) paper to tfa.layers. There is already existed an Keras implementation here: https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/, I feel like this is helpful and would have more visibility in tfa so I ask him in this [issue](https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/73) if I can help out porting the TCN layers portion into tfa and he says yes :)\r\nIf you feel like this would be a good addition let me know, very happy to contribute.\r\n\r\n**Relevant information**\r\n- Are you willing to contribute it (yes/no): yes of course :)\r\n- Are you willing to maintain it going forward? (yes/no): yes of course :)\r\n- Is there a relevant academic paper? (if so, where): yes [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271.pdf)\r\n- Is there already an implementation in another framework? (if so, where):\r\nNo but was implemented in pytorch in this repo, https://github.com/locuslab/TCN, and Keras in this repo https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn (will be working on porting the layers portion into tfa, asked owner for permission)\r\n- Was it part of tf.contrib? (if so, where): no\r\n\r\n**Which API type would this fall under (layer, metric, optimizer, etc.)**\r\nlayer\r\n\r\n**Who will benefit with this feature?**\r\nDevelopers who want to experiment with TCN layers.\r\n\r\n**Any other info.**\r\nGithub issue that initialize the conversation to port TCN layers from @philipperemy's repo to tensorflow addons (see last two comments in this
