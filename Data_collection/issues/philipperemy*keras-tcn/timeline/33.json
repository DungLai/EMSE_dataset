\r\nHi, thank you soooo much for your reply.

midi music using Bach's pieces by GAN. \r\n\r\nI used PrettyMIDI to get a piano roll at 20 samples/sec and fed it into a generator TCN with nb_stacks=4 and default parameters. \r\nThe discriminator is the same but its `return_sequence = False` and `Dense(1, activation=\"sigmoid\")`. \r\nI used the way from the copy memory task example where there is one more dimension telling its time to generate or not. \r\nso the input and output of the generator are like(129=128 notes + 1 control flag):\r\n```\r\nin (None, None, 129):\r\n000000000000000000|111111111111\r\na short slice of music

At the moment the computations are lost between two calls. In a stateful LSTM you keep the states (c, h) in memory. But in a TCN you dont have such states. So stateful or stateless does not really make sense for TCN. However, we could always cache some computations instead of recomputing all of them. But Im not sure on how to do that.
