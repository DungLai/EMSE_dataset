I'm trying to build a autoencoder using TCN. In my encoder part, the TCN will not return a sequence. After looking at your code, it seems to me that if return sequence is set to False, then only one slice in the last layer is kept for output. However, the convolution is still conducted for other slices. Tracing back the dilated convolution, many computations that only affect the discarded slices is wasted. I'm not sure if I understand it correctly. If not, please kindly point out. \r\n\r\nI also have a question in building the decoder. I'm not sure if I should use a identical dilation order in the TCN group of layers as in the encoder, or should reverse the dilation order. This is a general question not very related to the implementation of TCN itself so you can ignore it if you'd like to. Any comment/suggestions would be appreciated.
