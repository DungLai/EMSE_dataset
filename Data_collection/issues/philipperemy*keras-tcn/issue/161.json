Let's say that we want to use this TCN implementation in a real system that produces data each time-step. To get real-time results we make one prediction for each time-step, that means, one forward pass with the last data obtained along with the previous ones up to the TCN recepteive field/memory. \r\n\r\nIf we repeat this for each time-step, we are also repeating the computation of many convolution operations from the past.\r\nIs there any way to save the results of past computations to be reused in future steps? This would speed up the online computations achieving a faster real-time processing.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
