Let me briefly describe my problem. I have a set of trajectories  (let's say around 600) and each of these have a sequence of 117 images with their corresponding labels). I'm not sure how to shape the input such that it knows I have 117 time steps. \r\n\r\nFrom the Sequential MNIST example I can see the input shape is something like (60000,756,1) - so the tcn is treating the entire image as a sequence? Can I not instead do (60000,timesteps = 117, input_dim = (756,1) ) ? I apologize if this is a dumb question but I'm not sure where else to ask. I hope you can help me with this!
