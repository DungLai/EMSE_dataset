My x data are sequences of variable length  padded to max len of 2002 and the y is my encoded array (512). Were one sequence corresponds/describes  one such array of 512. Probably I understand something wrong, I tried different reshaping but could not get the model to predict different arrays. All are the same, currently I train with shape of  x = (68015,2002,1), y=(68015,1,512), when I try to predict with x_val (706,1,512), all of the 706 arrays are exactly the same, but each of them should correspond to a different array. I put my current code below. I was also wondering if an attention layer would be useful after the tcn?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, RepeatVector\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom tcn import TCN\r\nimport wandb\r\nfrom wandb.keras import WandbCallback\r\n\r\nwandb.init(project=\"tcn_seq\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbatch_size=32\r\nn_epochs=10\r\n\r\n\r\nytr=np.load('y_train.npy')\r\nytr=np.expand_dims(ytr,-2)\r\nyval=np.load('y_validation.npy')\r\nyval=np.expand_dims(yval,-2)\r\nxtr=np.load('train_x.npy')\r\n\r\n\r\nxval=np.load('val_x.npy')\r\n\r\n\r\ntcn = TCN(\r\n            nb_filters=256,\r\n            kernel_size=3,\r\n            dilations=[2 ** i for i in range(9)],\r\n            use_skip_connections=True,\r\n            use_layer_norm=True,\r\n            kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform'\r\n        )\r\nprint(f'TCN.receptive_field: {tcn.receptive_field}.')\r\nmodel = Sequential(layers=[tf.keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=10,input_shape=(2002,1)),                                       \r\n            tcn,\r\n            RepeatVector(1),               \r\n            Dropout(rate=0.2),\r\n            Dense(512, activation='relu'),\r\n            Dropout(rate=0.2),\r\n            Dense(512, activation='relu'),\r\n            Dropout(rate=0.2),               \r\n            Dense(512, activation='linear')\r\n        ])\r\n\r\n    # Compile and train.\r\n\r\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_absolute_error', optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),metrics=['mean_squared_error'])\r\nmodel.summary()\r\nmodel.fit(x=xtr,y=ytr,validation_data=(xval,yval), epochs=n_epochs,batch_size=batch_size,shuffle=False,callbacks=[WandbCallback(log_batch_frequency=1)])\r\nresult= model.predict(xval)\r\nnp.save(\"val_predict.npy\", result)\r\n\r\nmodel.save('train/tcn')\r\n\r\nprint('done!')","closed_by":{"login":"volvox292","id":63146629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTQ2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63146629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292","html_url":"https://github.com/volvox292","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volvox292/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
