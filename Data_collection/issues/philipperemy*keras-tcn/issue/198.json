I have a quenstion about the prediction for multidimensional data.\r\nIf the input for TCN is set (None, 10, 5), it means that a window contain 10 data, and the dimension of each data is 5. I want to know how the TCN to work for the prediction, is to create a TCN for each dimension to make a separate prediction?\r\nLooking forward to your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
