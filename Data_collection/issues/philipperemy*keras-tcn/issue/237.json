It is very beneficial to me.\r\nI am trying to make a NN model with the following code, but I face some issues I don't understand. I want the dilation to be one single number. Something like `dilations = (2,)`. The code is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    input_dim = 9\r\n    i = Input(batch_shape=(None, time_steps, input_dim))\r\n    d1 = (1,)\r\n    d2 = (2,)\r\n    d3 = (4,)\r\n    \r\n    nbf =2\r\n    \r\n    ks1 = 128\r\n    ks2 = 64\r\n    ks3 = 32\r\n    nbs =1 \r\n    tcn1 = TCN(nb_filters=nbf,\r\n           kernel_size=ks1,\r\n           dilations=d1,\r\n           return_sequences=True, \r\n           nb_stacks=nbs,\r\n           padding='same')(I)\r\n    tcn2 = TCN(nb_filters=nbf,\r\n           kernel_size=ks2,\r\n           dilations=d2,\r\n           return_sequences=True,\r\n           nb_stacks=nbs, \r\n           padding='same')(tcn1)\r\n    tcn3 = TCN(nb_filters=nbf,\r\n           kernel_size=ks3,\r\n           dilations=d3,\r\n           return_sequences=True,\r\n           nb_stacks=nbs, \r\n           padding='same')(tcn2)\r\n    o = Dense(1,activation='linear')(tcn3)\r\n    m = Model(inputs=[i], outputs=[o])\r\n    m.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\r\n    \r\n    history = m.fit(x,y, batch_size=12, epochs=300, validation_split=0.2, shuffle=True, callbacks=None)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then the error is:\r\n\r\n    ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer \"tcn_56\" (type TCN).\r\n    \r\n    in user code:\r\n    \r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tcn/tcn.py\", line 341, in call  *\r\n        x = layers.add(self.skip_connections, name='Add_Skip_Connections')\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/layers/merge.py\", line 791, in add  **\r\n        return Add(**kwargs)(inputs)\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/utils/traceback_utils.py\", line 67, in error_handler\r\n        raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/layers/merge.py\", line 92, in build\r\n        raise ValueError('A merge layer should be called '\r\n    \r\n    ValueError: A merge layer should be called on a list of at least 2 inputs.
