Basically I want to extract all of the highlighted nodes from the hidden layers in this diagram (nodes with arrows) into a list of activations, one for each residual block:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n[\r\n    np.array(shape=(8, n_ch)), # finest temporal activations\r\n    np.array(shape=(4, n_ch)), # middle temporal activations\r\n    np.array(shape=(2, n_ch)), # coarsest temporal activations\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6741720/60977797-10dfb500-a2fe-11e9-89e3-d0fb3f16cf39.png)\r\n\r\nThe way that I see it, I need to get the activation layers at the end of each residual block, get their output tensors, and slice them using a stride based on the dilation rate. I'm just not sure if I need to do anything special to handle dilation rates of stacked TCN blocks. I think it would be helpful to add a helper method/property that makes it easier to extract this context.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf you're wondering about my use case, I'm trying to build a time series autoencoder-style network for multi-scale anomaly detection and I'm trying to model the learned latent space at multiple temporal scales using some distribution (probably a gaussian mixture model atm).","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
