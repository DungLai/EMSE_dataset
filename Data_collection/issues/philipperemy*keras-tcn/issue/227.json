I'm a novice in machine learning. When I use TCN, the input dimension contains' timestep '. I can't understand the meaning of this dimension. In my experience, 'translations' and' kernel_ Size 'these two parameters should control the prediction step.For example,if  'definitions' is [1,2,4], while' kernel_ size 'is 2, it means that the first 1-7 variables entered are used to predict the current variable. What is the role of' timestep 'in the input dimension? If I want to predict the current variable through the first 1-7 input variables, should 'timestep' be filled in as 8? If you can answer, I will be very grateful!\r\n\r\n实在抱歉，我是机器学习领域的新手。当我使用TCN时，输入维度中含有'timestep'，我不能够理解这个维度的意思。根据我的经验，'dilations'和'kernel_size'这两个参数应该控制着预测步长，比如'dilations'为[1,2,4]，而'kernel_size'为2，那么就代表使用输入的前1-7个变量来预测当前变量。那么输入维度中的'timestep'的作用是什么呢？假如我想通过前1-7个输入变量来预测当前变量，那么'timestep'应该填写为8吗？如果您能够解答，我将非常感谢！","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
