In a visual representation, it is somewhat like a normal spectrogram image. Now I understand that TCN is essentially a 1-D FCN plus causal convolutions which takes input of size \r\n(batch_size, timesteps, input_dims). \r\n\r\nMy doubt is, when I provide a batch of 20 images of size (259 x 50) as input to the TCN that takes in input as (batch_size, timesteps, input_dims), does it mean that my image is broken into 50 different 1D arrays or is something else happening?\r\n\r\nQuick Note: I was able to train a image classification model using the above format of images with TCN having an accuracy of 95%.","closed_by":{"login":"puneat","id":32441618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQxNjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32441618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat","html_url":"https://github.com/puneat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
