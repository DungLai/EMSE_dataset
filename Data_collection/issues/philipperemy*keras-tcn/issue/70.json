I am using it for time series forecasting scenario based on the example given. After training the model, I saved it in h5 format using save method in Keras. However, when I try to load the model again using load_model() it gives an error saying \r\n\r\n**This version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent frames within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the**\r\n\r\n**IndexError: tuple index out of range**\r\n\r\nAfter some google search, I figured it might be because of the Lambda layer used in the model. In this scenario, what is the best option to save and load the TCN model ?
