I just have one question regarding the TCN training. As mentioned in the introduction document, one advantage of the TCN model is that it can be trained in parallel, because in each layer the kernels are the same and there is no sequential waiting issues like LSTM and RNN. My question is, such parallel training is achieved automatically by the existing code, or should be set up mannually by some additional codes?\r\n\r\nThanks, much appreciate!","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
