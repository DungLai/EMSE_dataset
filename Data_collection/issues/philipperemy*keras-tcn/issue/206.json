My system is Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) and I use Anaconda 2.0.3 as my package manager, Spyder 4.2.5 as my python editor (Python 3.8). I verified that the tcn module had been added to the Anaconda site packages (it is in the 'tcn' folder located here):\r\n\r\n.~/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tcn\r\n\r\nHowever, when I open an instance of Spyder and try importing using the following:\r\n\r\nfrom tcn import TCN, tcn_full_summary\r\n\r\nI receive the No module named 'tcn' error. Any ideas on solving this will be appreciated!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fjehlik","id":35613678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjEzNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35613678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik","html_url":"https://github.com/fjehlik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjehlik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
