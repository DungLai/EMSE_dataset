In my problem, the input is the current state (3 by 1 vector), and the output is the predicted state (2 by 1 vector).  For example, I want to predict a toy car, the inputs will be the current speed v, current position s, and current force f; the outputs will be the speed v and the position s in the next time step. The first 1000 steps are used to train the model. And I want to use this trained model to predict the next state when given the current state. \r\nI am just wondering how to set the input and output in TCN. \r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"philipperemy","id":4516927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4516927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy","html_url":"https://github.com/philipperemy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipperemy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
