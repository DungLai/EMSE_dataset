I'm quite new in CNN and, specifically in TCN, so if you have a Python toy example or any hint I'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"mttbrt","id":12787773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzg3Nzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12787773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt","html_url":"https://github.com/mttbrt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mttbrt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philipperemy/keras-tcn/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
