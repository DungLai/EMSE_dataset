What I am not clear on is how the kernel size, dilation values and number of stacks interact to determine the receptive field size.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have a kernel size=8, dilation values of [1,2,4,8] and stacks=3, how long should my sequence be so that it fully covers the receptive field of the TCN?
