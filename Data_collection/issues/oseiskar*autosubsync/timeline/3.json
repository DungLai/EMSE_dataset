Something like this:\r\n```\r\n1\r\n00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,500\r\nValid subtitle\r\nwith two lines\r\n\r\n2\r\n00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,922\r\n\r\nDouble line break above ^^, not OK\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,918\r\nMore subtitles\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure if double line breaks are technically valid SRT or not but added support for that anyway in #5. I also removed the original subtitle file, since I'm not sure if Github likes hosting subtitle files here in the long term.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/comments/471720846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2195225809,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE5NTIyNTgwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/events/2195225809","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T20:47:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2195225824,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxOTUyMjU4MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/events/2195225824","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dfa7203e98de0b8eebacbf7cc00dee024081600b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/commits/dfa7203e98de0b8eebacbf7cc00dee024081600b","created_at":"2019-03-11T20:47:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/comments/471730729","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/3#issuecomment-471730729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/3","id":471730729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTczMDcyOQ==","user":{"login":"aaomidi","id":1465785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjU3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1465785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi","html_url":"https://github.com/aaomidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaomidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T21:08:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T21:08:59Z","author_associ
