You seem to have some trouble with command line arguments in general. I tried to Google for a document that would explain the basics clearly without going too deep into shell scripting, but that was surprisingly difficult (maybe [this one](https://www.w3resource.com/linux-system-administration/commands-and-arguments.php) was the closest to what I was looking for) so here's a very short introduction.\r\n\r\n**Command line arguments are separated by whitespace**, *not* backslashes, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    autosubsync video.mp4 subs.srt synced.srt\r\n\r\n  (you're trying to use the backslash, like `autosubsync video.mp4\\subs.srt\\synced.srt`, which is incorrect).\r\n\r\n**If there are spaces in the file name or path, put it in quotes**, for example,\r\n\r\n    autosubsync \"folder name/video.mp4\" 'folder name/subs.srt' another_folder/synced.srt\r\n\r\nEither single-quotes or double-quotes can be used like in the above example.\r\n\r\n**...or...** An alternative way of doing this is using backslashes to escape the whitespace\r\n\r\n    autosubsync folder\\ name/video.mp4 folder\\ name/subs.srt another_folder/synced.srt\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/comments/519834150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2545766471,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0NTc2NjQ3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/events/2545766471","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-09T08:38:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/comments/519838287","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/7#issuecomment-519838287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/7","id":519838287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTgzODI4Nw==","user":{"login":"Kali0s","id":53921253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTIxMjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53921253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s","html_url":"https://github.com/Kali0s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kali0s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T08:50:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T08:50:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your help.
