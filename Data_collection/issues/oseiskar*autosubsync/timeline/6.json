That CSV looks suspicious and has been incorrectly parsed by Excel. Try to open it with a text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or Visual Studo Code) and verify that it is a valid CSV where the first row contains the elements `video`, `subtitles` and `language`, like [this file](https://github.com/oseiskar/autosubsync/blob/master/training/sources.csv.example). Especially count the `\"`'s. (your example contains an extra `\"` before \"subtitles\", but that might not be the only issue)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/comments/517987108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2708056363,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcwODA1NjM2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/oseiskar/autosubsync/issues/events/2708056363","actor":{"login":"oseiskar","id":1812432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTI0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1812432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiskar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-12T12:29:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
