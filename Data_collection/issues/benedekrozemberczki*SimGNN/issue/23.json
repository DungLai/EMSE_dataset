In particular, for AIDS dataset we get an order of magnitude higher MSE that in the original paper. Did you verify that this implementation match the performance of the paper? \r\n\r\nP.S. we also benchmarked the orignal repo of SimGNN and noticed that it produces slightly better results, even though it's very long to run until convergence.
