My graphs are similar but of different sizes. For your dataset, how did you pad the smaller graph to the larger graph? did you just add in extra \"labels\"?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN/issues/comments/628454181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonathan-goh","id":20589514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTg5NTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20589514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathan-goh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathan-goh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
