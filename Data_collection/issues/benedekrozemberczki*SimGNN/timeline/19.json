Had a few questions.\r\n> \r\n> * Do you have the pretrained model on any of the dataset (like IMDB) the paper talks about? The size of sample in the github dataset is small.\r\n> * Am I right that there is no early stopping in the model? As there is no validation set. [the reason I am asking this question is as I use a bigger dataset, with higher number of epochs, most of the ged predicted values are around 1]\r\n\r\nHello,friend.I am making some reserach on this paper too . If you want to use more dataset that has trained ,you could search \"MUTAG\" dataset for a try .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN/issues/comments/561433155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tiankonghenlan20113046","id":10166585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTY2NTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10166585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046","html_url":"https://github.com/tiankonghenlan20113046","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiankonghenlan20113046/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN/issues/comments/561434964","html_url":"https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN/issues/19#issuecomment-561434964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benedekrozemberczki/SimGNN/issues/19","id":561434964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTQzNDk2NA==","user":{"login":"BehroozMansouri","id":15178306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTc4MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15178306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri","html_url":"https://github.com/BehroozMansouri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BehroozMansouri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T01:35:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T01:35:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reply.
