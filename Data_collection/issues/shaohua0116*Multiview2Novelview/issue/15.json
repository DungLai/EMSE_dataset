I'm working these days on an undergraduate project with a partner. We are trying to use your model on general data without your supplied poses data using SfM algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor our project, we tried to use the data from KITTI's official website and couldn't make it work on your trained model. We understood the problem was that your poses data was different than the data on KITTI's website.\r\n\r\nCan you please explain how did you create your poses data from the data supplied on the KITTI website?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
