Author\r\nThanks for sharing your interesting work but i have the following questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is the specs of the machine you used cause it takes days of running with me and did not finish, for example it is working since 3 days and reached to:\r\n[2019-03-24 17:43:27,001] [train step 145431] Loss: 4.35295 Pixel loss: 4.03669 Flow loss: 0.31627 (1.589 sec/batch, 5.036 instances/sec)\r\nand did not finish yet. so am asking what is the number of training steps?\r\nthe input and output for your network is just images no videos right?\r\nI tried the following command :\r\npython trainer.py --batch_size 8 --dataset car --num_input 4\r\nbut it gives the following error after reaching training step (number train step 4251), do you have any idea why?\r\n[2019-03-23 05:36:24,763] [train step
