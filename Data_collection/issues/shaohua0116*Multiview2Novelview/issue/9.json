Did you have the time to experiment with normalization as well? Didn't it contribute to better results?\r\n\r\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"shaohua0116","id":3007039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDcwMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3007039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116","html_url":"https://github.com/shaohua0116","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaohua0116/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
