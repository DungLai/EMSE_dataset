Can I know what is the purpose of it? Unfortunately, I can not find where it is used. \r\n\r\nIs it related to calculating the loss? Maybe opting out the background pixels and only calculating loss on the object's pixels?\r\n\r\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n![foreground mask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45865860/55834408-7776ec00-5adf-11e9-8879-007b87f2c719.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AmirMahdiNassiri","id":45865860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODY1ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45865860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri","html_url":"https://github.com/AmirMahdiNassiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirMahdiNassiri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shaohua0116/Multiview2Novelview/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
