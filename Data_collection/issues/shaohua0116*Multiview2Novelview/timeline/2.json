I understand it now. But I have a few questions when I didn't understand reading your paper. \r\n1. When I checked the data inside the h5py file of KITTI dataset and ShapeNet dataset. I found that for each key image in the KITTI dataset, there are 3 inner key information: image, pose, and pose_matrix. But the in ShapeNet dataset, there are only 2 inner key information: image and pose. Can u explain why you need pose_matrix to train ?\r\n2. My second question is that: in case of KITTI dataset. I can see that pose is a vector representing 6DoF and pose_matrix is a 3x4 matrix. Would you mind telling me how did you obtain those values from KITTI dataset. I checked the guideline at this link https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/avg-kitti/devkit_raw_data.zip and it said that I can get poses from GPS/IMU data. So I would like to ask is that the way you get those pose information ? \r\nThank you in advance !
