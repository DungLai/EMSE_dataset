Can I take the probabilities from infer_cls.py? (e.g., https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa/blob/b091fe85c05e6dd537b1e682a66ccd266c1f18e8/network/vgg16_cls.py#L28)\r\n\r\nSince in infer_cls.py, you only do forward_cam instead of forward, I am wondering if you can take the outputted probability of each class from here. My understanding is, I can only obtain the CAMs from here. If my understanding is wrong, do you have any suggestions about how to take the probability of each class of the multi-label classifier out?
