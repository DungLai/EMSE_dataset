I think you applied CRF on CAMs and then use that CAM to train AffinityNet. Then you use generated pseudo-groundtruthes to train the segmentation network. For testing, you only need to evaluate the output data from the segmentation network. Hope I understand correctly this time.\r\n\r\nHere is another question, in your paper, Table1 and Table 5 show the mIoU of synthesized segmentation labels at different stages. I am wondering if the column CAM+RW+dCRF means the IoU of CAM--> apply dCRF --> apply random walk? If so, how did you apply random walk on the CAM that be refined by dCRF? Because the background is generated after applying dCRF, how did you handle background values when applying random walk? \r\n\r\nI appreciate that you spend your time to reply this.
