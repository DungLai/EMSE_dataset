To convert DeepLab as a CAM network, I followed https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08261.pdf. (which includes removing last max polling layer, adjusting dilation rate, etc.)\r\n* Then, I found that as the last maxpooling layer was removed, the varaince of the activation map has become different which can be simply compensated by `x = torch.sqrt(x)`. (This is not neccessary when tyring with other backbone networks such as VGG-GAP https://github.com/metalbubble/CAM)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jiwoon-ahn/psa/issues/comments/428898922/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jiwoon-ahn","id":39397799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Mzk3Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39397799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1907352500,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkwNzM1MjUwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jiwoon-ahn/psa/issues/events/1907352500","actor":{"login":"jiwoon-ahn","id":39397799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Mzk3Nzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39397799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwoon-ahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-16T16:39:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
