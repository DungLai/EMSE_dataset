You likely need to enforce numpy == 1.17 I believe in order for pycocotools to function properly. pycocotools mAP is typically about 1% higher than ours (for unknown reasons), so your result is just about in line with the readme. The only other 'catch' is that mAP@0.5 is highest at --conf 0.5, while mAP@0.5:0.95 is highest at --conf 0.7, so the training results show you mAP at the middle ground --conf 0.6. If you really want to maximize one or the other (as in the readme table), you should set your --conf accordingly (but we are talking about fractions of a percent here, so not a big difference).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/624290153/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3305907149,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMwNTkwNzE0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3305907149","actor":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-05T20:31:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3305907152,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMDU5MDcxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3305907152","actor":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-05T20:31:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/639185275","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1111#issuecomment-639185275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1111","id":639185275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTE4NTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https:
