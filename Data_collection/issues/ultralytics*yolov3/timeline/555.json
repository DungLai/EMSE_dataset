Hi, I'm trying to detect traffic signs using this great YOLOv3 implementation. However, I have stumbled upon something I would categorize a bug.\r\n> \r\n> My pictures are fairly large (4000px * 3000px). I, therefore, tile the images to avoid downscaling the pictures (and thereby risking labels being 2px * 2px in some cases). Each tile will contain at least one sign and typically be 608 * 608 pixels.\r\n> \r\n> The problem appears when i start training on these tiles/images. In commits from [cfc562c](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/cfc562c2c889cc7a4cb7e6c3b020ec6e36ce6bc4) and older, some of the images will be mirrored. As seen in the picture below the two images in the first column is mirrored where the two pictures in the second column are unmodified. This is suboptimal for traffic sign detection, as some of the signs may mean something different when mirrored.\r\n> \r\n> ![train_batch0 - cfc562c2c889cc7a4cb7e6c3b020ec6e36ce6bc4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7311836/66754447-431d2780-ee96-11e9-889d-50248a3d9115.jpg)\r\n> \r\n> Newer commits (from [88ba615](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/88ba61505fa07b12b608f598ed9d2cf91ff872c2)), however, are not only mirroring the images but are also padding them with other images found in the dataset.

This procedure is done until no label intersects the tile, then move to the next tile and perform the exact same procedure. The drawback of this approach is that you risk having large tiles on pictures with many labels, I did not so it worked for me.\r\n\r\nDuring my experiment, I found that the tiling approach is outperforming the full-size approach only if you are willing to infer on tiled images. This results in longer processing time per full-size image as it is divided into several small images. The gain was not worth it in my case, but this would vary based on use case and domain, I would suspect.\r\n\r\nHope it helped, have a good one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/606459606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fromm1990","id":7311836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTE4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7311836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990","html_url":"https://github.com/fromm1990","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fromm1990/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3181982705,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE4MTk4MjcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3181982705","actor":{"login":"robisen1","id":6577477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6577477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1","html_url":"https://github.com/robisen1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T07:47:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3181982706,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxODE5ODI3MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3181982706","actor":{"login":"robisen1","id":6577477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6577477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1","html_url":"https://github.com/robisen1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robisen1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T07:47:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/606776315","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/555#issuecomment-606776315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/555","id":606776315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjc3NjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-31T17:47:23Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T17:47:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@robisen1
