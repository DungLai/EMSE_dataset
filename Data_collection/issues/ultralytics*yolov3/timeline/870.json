This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, PyTorch >= 1.4 etc. You can also use our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw) and our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3) to test your code in a working environment.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.

I was able to train a new model and convert it to a .weights file successfully. Inference with darknet works ok. However I encountered some new issues:\r\n\r\n-  Precision stays very close to 0 during training. I didn't change my dataset or parameters so I guess the issue comes from new code.\r\n- I have [this issue](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/896#issue-575992501), when using test.py. It seems to occur for one of my test images where no object is detected (edit: I tried to do a git pull as suggested but my repo was already up to date)\r\n- \"--evolve\" is broken because of the new 'gr' parameters. I believe it is because of this line (the new parameter is missing its evolve gain) :\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/76080475311f70d24b06ec11d8f3e5fe61c550ba/train.py#L458","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/595225492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TheophileBlard","id":37028092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDI4MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37028092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard","html_url":"https://github.com/TheophileBlard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/595370677","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/870#issuecomment-595370677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/870","id":595370677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTM3MDY3Nw==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-05T18:12:03Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T18:12:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@TheophileBlard yes the new update always tests at the same 0.001 conf threshold during training as is used independently when running test.py directly. This allows train.py to plot higher mAPs. The precision should be near zero and the recall should be near 1.0 during optimal conditions because it is plotting the end of the P-R curve (mAP is the area under this curve).

@TheophileBlard yes the new update always tests at the same 0.001 conf threshold during training as is used independently when running test.py directly. This allows train.py to plot higher mAPs. The precision should be near zero and the recall should be near 1.0 during optimal conditions because it is plotting the end of the P-R curve (mAP is the area under this curve).

I will look into the hyperparameter situation.\r\n\r\nHi, thanks for the changes and pointers ! As I understand it, https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/1dc1761f45fe46f077694e1a70472cd7eb788e0c solves the hyperparameters/evolve issue and https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/b8b89a31329da9ba4146493e73f4762abca741e4 the nms one.\r\n\r\nRegarding precision, I see your point (by the way the new tutorial #898 is really appreciated). The `conf_thresh` was changed from 0.1 to 0.001 in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/6ab753a9e7a9c88ff26530ffa23d7350f3bda552, which explains the precision drop when using `plot_results()` during training. \r\n\r\nI understand that there is no impact on the training process, but why would you want to plot \"higher mAPs\" ? Also, should I keep a low `conf_thresh` when using the --evolve parameter ? As you explain in #392, hyperparameters are tuned depending on `fitness`. But if the precision is low, the `fitness` would not also be abnormally low ?\r\n\r\nOn my side, this issue can be closed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/595660668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TheophileBlard","id":37028092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDI4MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37028092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard","html_url":"https://github.com/TheophileBlard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheophileBlard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
