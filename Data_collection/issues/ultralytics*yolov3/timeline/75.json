@Codermay I just re-read your message. I think you confused the .cfg batch size for the one the repo is using. The repo uses the `batch_size` parameter specified in train.py, not the value specified in the cfg file. For a 1080 Ti you can do `batch_size=16`. For multiscale on a 1080 Ti you can do `batch_size=8`.
