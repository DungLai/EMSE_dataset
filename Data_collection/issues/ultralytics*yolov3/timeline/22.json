@JegernOUTT sorry guys, I'm still trying to figure out the exact loss terms to use. Small changes have huge effects. Some of the options that need testing are:\r\n\r\n1. CE vs BCE for the classification loss.\r\n2. Size averaging vs not size averaging all loss terms.\r\n3. Splitting confidence into obj and noobj, or not splitting (this is what's causing the very low TPs)\r\n\r\nThe main region of the code affected is small. My main strategy is to resume training from official yolov3.pt weights and look for the loss terms that produce the best mAP after 1 epoch. In the latest commit b7d039737abdc4bbc1617504847ef1361e31e885 the mAP after 1 epoch of resumed training is about 0.50 mAP, down from 0.57 mAP with the official weights, so something is probably still not right I think.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/b7d039737abdc4bbc1617504847ef1361e31e885/models.py#L160-L182","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/427495311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1888091838,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4ODA5MTgzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1888091838","actor":{"login":"JegernOUTT","id":9404669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDQ2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9404669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT","html_url":"https://github.com/JegernOUTT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-05T20:51:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888091841,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4ODgwOTE4NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1888091841","actor":{"login":"JegernOUTT","id":9404669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDQ2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9404669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT","html_url":"https://github.com/JegernOUTT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JegernOUTT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-05T20:51:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888091843,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4ODA5MTg0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1888091843","actor":{"login":"xiao1228","id":11752039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzUyMDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11752039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228","html_url":"https://github.com/xiao1228","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-05T20:51:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888091844,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdm

:"@ydixon thats interesting, I'll try disabling the HSV augmentation and then disabling the spatial augmentation as two additional tests. You are right this could have a significant impact. I'm also going to try a larger batch size (16 vs 12). Darknet may be training with a much larger batch size (64?).\r\n\r\n@ECer23 thanks a lot for the plots! I'm going to plot the same on my end for one resumed epoch. I wish your results were correct, but I think you might accidentally be testing the same yolov3.pt to get that 56.67 mAP. After you resume for one epoch the new weights are saved in latest.pt (not yolov3.pt). The code I've been using to do these tests is here:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3 && git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3\r\ncd yolov3/checkpoints\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/ultralytics/yolov3.pt\r\ncp yolov3.pt latest.pt\r\ncd ..\r\npython3 train.py -img_size 416 -batch_size 12 -epochs 1 -resume 1\r\npython3 test.py -img_size 416 -weights_path checkpoints/latest.pt -conf_thres 0.5\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/427670701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1889095283,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4OTA5NTI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1889095283","actor":{"login":"ecr23xx","id":14848081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ4MDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14848081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx","html_url":"https://github.com/ecr23xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-07T17:26:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1889095284,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4ODkwOTUyODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1889095284","actor":{"login":"ecr23xx","id":14848081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ4MDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14848081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx","html_url":"https://github.com/ecr23xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecr23xx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-07T17:26:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1889095285,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4OTA5NTI4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1889095285","actor":{"login":"ydixon","id":22487836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg3ODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22487836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon","html_url":"https://github.com/ydixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-07T17:26:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1889095286,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4ODkwOTUyODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1889095286","actor":{"login":"ydixon","id":22487836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg3ODM2","avatar_url":"https:/
