yes, this is expected behavior. This is happening because yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt is trained on COCO2014, which has a different train/test split than COCO2017, so it is 'cheating' since it has seen some of the 2017 test images during training, and thus does a better job on them.\r\n\r\nA more accurate mAP is about 42/62, which is what you should get when testing on COCO2014.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you train from scratch on COCO2017, then you should also get about the same mAP when testing on COCO2017.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/605286238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3173833679,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE3MzgzMzY3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3173833679","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:49:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3173833682,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNzM4MzM2ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3173833682","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:49:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/605286691","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/970#issuecomment-605286691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/970","id":605286691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTI4NjY5MQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:50:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T19:53:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
