👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about model anchors. YOLOv5 🚀 uses a new [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) algorithm called **autoanchor** for anchor verification and generation before training starts.\r\n\r\nAutoanchor will analyse your anchors against your dataset and training settings (like `--img-size`), and will adjust your anchors as necessary if it determines the original anchors are a poor fit, or if an **anchor count** was specified in your model.yaml rather than **anchor values**, i.e. \r\n```yaml\r\n# Specify anchor count (per layer)\r\nanchors: 3\r\n\r\n# --OR-- Specify anchor values manually\r\nanchors:\r\n  - [10,13, 16,30, 33,23]  # P3/8\r\n  - [30,61, 62,45, 59,119]  # P4/16\r\n  - [116,90, 156,198, 373,326]  # P5/32\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen generating new anchors, autoanchor first applies a kmeans function against your dataset labels (scaled to your training `--img-size`), and uses kmeans centroids as initial conditions for a Genetic Evolution (GE) algorithm. The GE algorithm will evolve all anchors for 1000 generations under default settings, using CIoU loss (same regression loss used during training) combined with Best Possible Recall (BPR) as its fitness function.\r\n\r\nNotebook example: <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov5\"><img src=\"https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg\" alt=\"Open In Kaggle\"></a>\r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-09 at 1 59 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/136673689-23a522f1-5175-416e-830b-cf0c97135fd1.png\">\r\n\r\n**No action is required on your part** to use autoanchor. If you would like to force manual anchors for any reason, you can skip autoanchor with the `--noautoanchor` flag:\r\n```shell\r\npython train.py

I see that the yolov3 train.py module also has the autoanchor flag:\r\n\r\nparser.add_argument('--noautoanchor', action='store_true', help='disable autoanchor check')\r\n\r\ndoes this somehow use the yolov5 autoanchor algorithm as well?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKarl
