for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nOnnx was at latest python version, but I managed to get it to export by lowering the opset slightly.\r\n\r\nThis however made me realize that this might not be the best solution for my usecase anyway.\r\n\r\nMy situation is this: I need object detection as a first stage in my pipeline, and your repo was great for training such a custom detector. I now want to combine that detector with our pose estimator (https://github.com/shbe-aau/multi-pose-estimation) in a (preferably slim) version. So I only need preprocessing and inference versions of the networks, that I can build together and pass cutouts of the image from each bbox to my code.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best solution for how to import your code for such a scenario? Do I get the preprocessing that the model expects with onnx? \r\n\r\nI tried importing with torch.hub (custom, local) but ran into issues that seem to be due to your costom hub code breaking if not calling it in your repos folder (not finding models.yolo, looking in my utils folder in m repo rather than in yours et.c.). Calling torch.hub when located in your repo works fine with my custom trained model (and weights). How can I import the model I trained with your code in another repo?\r\n\r\nSorry if anything is unclear, I have not used torch.hub before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/977317539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HampusAstrom","id":17680461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjgwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17680461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/HampusAstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/977725721","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1866#issuecomment-977725721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1866","id":977725721,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM46RukZ","user":{"login":"HampusAstrom","id":17680461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjgwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17680461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/HampusAstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HampusAstrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-24T10:08:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T10:08:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For instance if I try to follow them method mentioned here https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/22#issuecomment-743926651 I get the following error: \r\n```\r\nDownloading: \"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/archive/master.zip\" to /home/hampus/.cache/torch/hub/master.zip\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"inference.py\", line 131, in <module>\r\n    inference = Inference()\r\n  File \"inference.py\", line 53, in __init__\r\n    detector = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov3', \"yolov3\", classes=30, force_reload=True, pretrained=False)\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/hub.py\", line 370, in load\r\n    model = _load_local(repo_or_dir, model, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/hub.py\", line 399, in _load_local\r\n    model = entry(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov3_master/hubconf.py\", line 74, in yolov3\r\n    return _create('yolov3', pretrained, channels, classes, autoshape, verbose, device)\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov3_master/hubconf.py\", line 30, in _create\r\n    from models.experimental import attempt_load\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov3_master/models/experimental.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    from models.common import Conv\r\n  File \"/home/hampus/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov3_master/models/common.py\", line 22, in <module>\r\n    from utils.datasets import exif_transpose, letterbox\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils.datasets' \r\n```\r\nSimilar to the issues in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/1181.
