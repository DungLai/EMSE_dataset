hi there! In yolov4.cfg I see that @alexeyab made judicious use of the mish activation, using it only in the most important places, but it looks like in pytorch at least yolov4.cfg still increases the gpu ram requirements significantly, assuming the standard mish class. I looked at @thomasbrandon repo, but it looked like it required building CUDA from source with his extensions included, which may be a bridge too far for many users, especially those with short-lived environments like Google Colab notebooks.\r\n\r\nI was thinking perhaps you guys could look at lighter weight approximations, sort of the way the mobilenetv3 guys replaced swish with a 'hard-swish' which removed the sigmoid. At the end of the day the best implementation we want is probably a compromise between speed, memory and accuracy.\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02244.pdf\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screen Shot
