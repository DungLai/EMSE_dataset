ah, that's some good investigating! Yes, there is a small fraction of the objects which will not be trained because they may not meet the iou criteria under many multi-scale shapes. In our latest cfg's we run kmeans on the COCO dataset to create new anchors and we track this statistic, which is called the Best Possible Recall (BPR).\r\n\r\nFor the latest anchors we've done we get this below, which means 99.2% of the objects should match at least 1 anchor. Your results using the default anchors would be (36335-429) / 36335 = 98.8, which is close.\r\n\r\nYes, these are probably higher or low aspect ratio boxes. It's possible that there is room for improvement here, but an implementation issue in build_targets() is that only 1 yolo layer is examined at a time for matches, there is no 'global' look to see if an object misses all the anchors. Conversely, reducing the iou threshold results in lower mAP, as more anchors are having to stretch their width and height to match the more differently shaped boxes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.20 iou_thr: 0.992
