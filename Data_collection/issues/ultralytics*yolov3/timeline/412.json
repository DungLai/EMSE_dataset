This must be something external to the repo, maybe run settings or environment variables in Spyder or PyCharm are somehow causing this, or maybe it has to do with the utils folder requiring the init.py. \r\n\r\nOur workflow here is to develop and debug on mac on cpu most of the time, with some GCP training on debian unix, and then some on premise training now with a single GPU windows machine also. All of these platforms are working as intended AFAIK right now. I can try to introduce the print statement on our windows machine too when it frees up later.\r\n\r\nBTW I did not know about multi-gpu not working on windows or mac.

For example if we had `--num-workers 4` it might try and load up 16 batches of images instead of 4 the very first time (with a very long, noticeable delay also in that first batch).

I can reproduce the bug on Windows now, Mac and Unix are good.
