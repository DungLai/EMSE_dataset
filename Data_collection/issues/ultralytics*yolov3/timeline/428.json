@glenn-jocher thanks for the response.\r\nBy the way, the question is not regarding yolov3 and I have tried 1.5,1.4,1.3 but the error almost remains the same. \r\nFailed to export an ONNX attribute 'onnx::Gather', since it's not constant, please try to make things (e.g., kernel size) static if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrong place to ask this question so I have open this issue here.\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2807#issue-628940240\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/637312360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Akshaysharma29","id":17704217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA0MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17704217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29","html_url":"https://github.com/Akshaysharma29","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshaysharma29/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3396096248,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM5NjA5NjI0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3396096248","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:41:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3396096249,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzOTYwOTYyNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3396096249","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:41:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
