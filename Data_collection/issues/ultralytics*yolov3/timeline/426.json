I think if you want to do this, the easiest method would be to find a pretrained alexnet.weights model if they are available, and then pass that in along with alexnet.cfg to convert to a working pytorch alexnet that is translatable to darknet.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to train alexnet on alexyab/darknet, and then you could convert your trained alexnet.weights and alexnet.cfg to alexnet.pt to work with this repo. The complication arises from the fact that while this is a PyTorch repo, it is linked closely to darknet, so models trained here are exportable to darknet, and darknet trained models are usable here (but not so much torchvision models).\r\n\r\nIn your example you have the model originating from one source (torchvision) and the cfg from another (darknet), and this is the reason for the incompatibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/518626359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2546659747,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0NjY1OTc0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2546659747","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-09T14:27:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
