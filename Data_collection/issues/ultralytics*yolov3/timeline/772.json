I check this is the very first  image in the training list, so it can not read the images , i think there is something wrong with the code, not with the data because as i said it is working with some other fork.

there is nothing wrong with the repo. We are training multiple custom datasets for multiple customers at this moment, and all are operating correctly.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you don't have the latest code, because your line 297 is not the same as the current line 297. I'll past you our default response.\r\n\r\nHello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, PyTorch >= 1.3 etc. You can also use our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw) and our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3) to test your code in working environment.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.

you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/575969851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2960661478,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk2MDY2MTQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2960661478","actor":{"login":"MuhammadAsadJaved","id":28862708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODYyNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28862708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved","html_url":"https://github.com/MuhammadAsadJaved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-19T05:47:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2960661479,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NjA2NjE0Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2960661479","actor":{"login":"MuhammadAsadJaved","id":28862708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODYyNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28862708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved","html_url":"https://github.com/MuhammadAsadJaved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-19T05:47:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/576087286","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/772#issuecomment-576087286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/772","id":576087286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjA4NzI4Ng==","user":{"login":"MuhammadAsadJaved","id":28862708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODYyNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28862708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved","html_url":"https://github.com/MuhammadAsadJaved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuhammadAsadJaved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muhamma

🐛 Bug\r\nI was get this error today:\r\nValueError: could not convert string to float: 'data/slimyolov3/images/val/0000291_00001_d_0000868.jpg'\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nthis is my .data file:\r\nclasses=10\r\ntrain=data/slimyolov3/train.list\r\nvalid=data/slimyolov3/val.list\r\nlabels=data/slimyolov3/labels.txt\r\nnames=data/slimyolov3/labels.txt\r\nbackup=backup\r\neval=coco\r\n\r\nI see that in datasets.py, if my val is in another extension than '.txt\", it will think .shapes file exists. \r\n\r\ncurrent path: \"data/slimyolov3/val.list\"\r\n`\r\nsp = path.replace('.txt', '.shapes')  # shapefile path\r\n`\r\nsp after replace: \"data/slimyolov3/val.list\"\r\n\r\nSo, when file is readed, _s_ will have something like that:\r\n\r\n[['data/slimyolov3/images/val/0000291_00001_d_0000868.jpg'], ['data/slimyolov3/images/val/0000330_01801_d_0000809.jpg'] .... ]\r\n\r\nso when this line is executed:\r\n` s = np.array(s, dtype=np.float64)\r\n`\r\nwill raise ValueError: could not convert string to float\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nI think it is a little confusing, because it is due to wrong file extension in 'valid'. I think should handle the error better. \r\n\r\nWhen I change to .txt, it works.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
