not from the command line, but you could hard code those in the python code if you really wanted to.\r\n\r\nOr you could supply a dataset of 100% images of that aspect ratio and then --rect would always do the same shape. For example if you train on 1080p video stills, then your ratio is 16:9, and if you specify --img-size 608 --rect then the network input size for the short side would always be 608*9/16 = 342, rounded up = 352 (5 pixels of padding top and bottom), so all of your batches would be shaped 640x352.

padding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597360118/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3116744855,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzExNjc0NDg1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3116744855","actor":{"login":"AlexeyAB","id":4096485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTY0ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4096485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexeyAB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-10T22:56:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3116744856,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMTY3NDQ4NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3116744856","actor":{"login":"AlexeyAB","id":4096485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTY0ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4096485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexeyAB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyAB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-10T22:56:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/611810995","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/909#issuecomment-611810995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/909","id":611810995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTgxMDk5NQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"crea

is it possible to easily modify the code to test on arbitrary image sizes (not rounded to multiples of 64)? \r\nWhat is the rationale behind using [64](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/train.py#L67) as grid size and normalizing widths and heights? I think it was previously set to 32. Will the mosaic dataloader break if all the images don't have the same size? For example if I use the standard yolov3-spp-608 cfg, the model won't actually use 608 for training or testing. Isn't that misleading? \r\nWhile testing you use letterbox to pad the images to nearest 64 multiple. Is it easy (simple modifications to python code) and does it make sense to turn off padding in 1. training (mosaic) 2. testing (letterbox)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/624731115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anisaha1","id":58056445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDU2NDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58056445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1","html_url":"https://github.com/anisaha1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anisaha1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3309137247,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMwOTEzNzI0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3309137247","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-06T15:50:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3309137251,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMDkxMzcyNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3309137251","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-06T15:50:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/624871660","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/909#issuecomment-624871660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/909","id":624871660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDg3MTY2MA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T20:26:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T20:26:07Z

Let's say I have a 1920x1080 image, if I pass 320 as imgsz_test, then the test image gets height padded to have 320x192 dimensions.
