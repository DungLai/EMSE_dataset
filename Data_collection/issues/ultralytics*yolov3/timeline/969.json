hi there! Regarding mAP computation:\r\n\r\n1. Each repo will probably return slightly different results using the same exact model. The best official mAP computation is `pycocotools`, though this will only work on COCO data. You can see that pycocotools and this repo differ within about 1-2% in mAP computations, and I would not be surprised in AlexeyAB differs by a similar amount **on the same exact model**. In your chart you show 63% and 47% mAPs. Are these using the same exact model?\r\n\r\n2. Using this repo you can pass *.weights and *.pt models both equally to test.py, though these should return you **exactly identical mAPs** if they are simple conversions of each other. For example `yolov3-spp.pt` and `yolov3-spp.weights` will give you identical mAPs on COCO.\r\n\r\n3. In terms of model **training**, this will be completely different between the two repos, and I would not be surprised if your results vary substantially depending on your dataset and training settings, even for the same exact *.cfg

Wow, thanks for the quick answer!\r\n\r\n**1. mAP computation for custom data**\r\n\r\nYes, exactly because it is reported that there is a slight difference between the mAPs that I was in doubt. I took my weight that was trained on Darknet with 63.39%:\r\n\r\n`./darknet detector map custom.data custom.cfg custom.weights -points 101 -thresh 0.25 -iou_thresh 0.5`\r\n\r\nI converted it to PyTorch Ultralytics and got 46.8%:\r\n\r\n`python3 test.py --cfg custom.cfg --data custom.data --weights custom.weights --batch-size 1 --conf-thres 0.25 --iou-thres 0.5 --task test`\r\n\r\nI just wanted to check if they would give the same value, since it is the same weight file. Considering the same confidence threshold (`conf_thres`), same IoU threshold (`iou_thres`), same batch size (`batch_size`), same configuration file (`.cfg`, `.data`) and same validation set (`valid.txt`). As both metrics deal with mAP@0.5 with 101 points, why are the values ​​different? That's my question. Shouldn't they be the same since the model is the same (`.cfg`, `.data` and `.weights`)? Yes, I am using the same model on all charts. It was an attempt to find the same 63.39%, since with the same thresholds (`iou_thres = 0.5` and `conf_thres = 0.25`) the result was totally different.\r\n\r\n**2. Training with custom data**\r\n\r\nWell, then, you cannot expect to get the same result for the same hyperparameters, since the implementations are different. But I can still achieve a similar performance by training in PyTorch Ultralytics, right? But with other hyperparameters. Is that what you mean? The best I got was mAP@0.5=54.47% with very different hyperparameters. The learning rate 10 times lower than the default Darknet, Adamax optimizer, etc. I'm not using YOLOv3-SPP, is it better?\r\n\r\nThank you so much

a true mAP computation evaluates the area under the entire P-R curve, which essentially means you use --conf 0.0. To save time, and to approximate this effect, people occasionally use higher --conf thresholds, like 0.01 etc, 0.10 etc, but 0.25 is way too high.

So to produce the most accurate mAP value I recommend you do not change the default settings in this repo when running test.py.\r\n\r\nFor best results we recommend you leave everything alone and train with default settings (including the default cfg and pretrained weights already in train.py.).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/604696384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3170152355,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE3MDE1MjM1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3170152355","actor":{"login":"pedbrgs","id":30960165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTYwMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30960165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs","html_url":"https://github.com/pedbrgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T21:28:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3170152358,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNzAxNTIzNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3170152358","actor":{"login":"pedbrgs","id":30960165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTYwMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30960165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs","html_url":"https://github.com/pedbrgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T21:28:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/604754910","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/969#issuecomment-604754910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/969","id":604754910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDc1NDkxMA==","user":{"login":"pedbrgs","id":30960165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTYwMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30960165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs","html_url":"https://github.com/pedbrgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedbrgs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T00:31:34Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T00:31:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher
