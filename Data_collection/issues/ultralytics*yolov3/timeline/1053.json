differences in evaluation code I found are\r\n[here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/utils/utils.py#L187)\r\n\r\nI make sure to use pr_score=0.5 for both the evaluations.\r\n\r\nAnother difference I found is in dataset class.\r\n[here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/utils/datasets.py#L316)\r\n\r\nNow you use 64 to determine ceil but previously it was 32.\r\nI use 32 for both. So that now my rect evaluation loads w=608 h=352 images.\r\n\r\nAlso the padding color was changed from 128 to 114. I use 128 for both.\r\n\r\nI debugged and checked all these.\r\nGoing further, I used batch size 1 and verified that both the runs are using the same image (tensor elem exactly match) and then realised that [stats](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/test.py#L163) for both are different.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to find the first point of difference, I realised that they differ in the [model outputs](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/test.py#L89).\r\ninf_out and train_out are different. Looking ahead I see nms has changed. When I look at the output from nms and compare.\r\n\r\nPrevious commit \r\n```\r\n[tensor([[4.24846e+02, 1.16075e+02, 4.66598e+02, 1.83097e+02, 2.43290e-01, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.67769e+02, 1.28197e+02, 4.05120e+02, 1.69826e+02, 5.19221e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.62796e+02, 1.26772e+02, 3.92630e+02, 1.64479e+02, 5.11679e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.94982e+02, 1.61770e+02, 4.21833e+02, 2.15738e+02, 4.75513e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.33304e+02, 1.36082e+02, 4.68935e+02, 1.86989e+02, 2.53201e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [2.27791e+02, 4.47863e+01, 2.90084e+02, 7.70560e+01, 2.07295e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [1.01814e+02, 2.48703e+02, 1.18085e+02, 2.77619e+02, 2.00094e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.80672e+02, 1.24300e+02, 5.02177e+02, 1.88335e+02, 1.73539e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [2.98101e+02, 1.54136e+02, 3.26343e+02, 1.71951e+02, 1.66848e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.03248e+02, 8.58442e+01, 4.81398e+02, 2.12015e+02, 1.60923e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.98539e+02, 2.66021e+02, 4.20301e+02, 2.90160e+02, 1.52305e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.78264e+02, 2.13352e+02, 5.06942e+02, 2.74858e+02, 1.26878e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [1.23062e+02, 5.67930e+01, 1.68904e+02, 1.14108e+02, 1.25194e-03, 0.00000e+00]], device='cuda:0')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs \r\n\r\nLatest commit\r\n```\r\n[tensor([[4.25922e+02, 1.15556e+02, 4.66457e+02, 1.82373e+02, 1.53491e-03, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.67292e+02, 1.27992e+02, 4.05236e+02, 1.72844e+02, 3.48482e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.63847e+02, 1.27433e+02, 3.95944e+02, 1.66559e+02, 3.40591e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.94382e+02, 1.62833e+02, 4.20858e+02, 2.16175e+02, 2.94471e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.29828e+02, 1.21102e+02, 4.67772e+02, 1.84239e+02, 1.66407e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [2.27506e+02, 4.60600e+01, 2.89019e+02, 8.09557e+01, 1.39763e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [1.00274e+02, 2.46150e+02, 1.17413e+02, 2.77223e+02, 1.34300e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.80722e+02, 1.27559e+02, 5.02005e+02, 1.89555e+02, 1.21646e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.03203e+02, 8.57977e+01, 4.81431e+02, 2.12033e+02, 1.06420e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [2.98092e+02, 1.54144e+02, 3.26326e+02, 1.71955e+02, 1.06069e-05, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [3.98527e+02, 2.66022e+02, 4.20305e+02, 2.90189e+02, 9.96113e-06, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [4.78254e+02, 2.13289e+02, 5.07026e+02, 2.74951e+02, 8.48345e-06, 0.00000e+00],\r\n         [1.23247e+02, 5.68922e+01, 1.68954e+02, 1.14238e+02, 8.07492e-06, 0.00000e+00]], device='cuda:0')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe conf values are very different.\r\n\r\nI saw that a lot of changes in the Darknet class have been made since.
