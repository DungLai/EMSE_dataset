This was done as the result of a hyperparameter search from a few months ago https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/2#issuecomment-442050796, though this was done on the incorrect mAP metric used back then, so it should probably be redone. \r\n\r\ncls loss is also divided by 4, so the natural conf and cls losses at epoch 0 batch 0 are really about 2 and 12 rather than 139 and 3.29. You can run your own evaluation of these loss component weights, or reset them to 1 (which would align more closely with the darknet loss function as I understand it), but in our tests we saw much worse results this way.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/09b02d2029ffa57880793c2e593e2b54175307ad/utils/utils.py#L264-L277","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/478364682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241686682,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI0MTY4NjY4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2241686682","actor":{"login":"mlpotter","id":35242331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQyMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35242331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter","html_url":"https://github.com/mlpotter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-31T18:12:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2241686683,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNDE2ODY2ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2241686683","actor":{"login":"mlpotter","id":35242331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjQyMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35242331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter","html_url":"https://github.com/mlpotter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlpotter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-31T18:12:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2257856875,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI1Nzg1Njg3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2257856875","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-07T09:53:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
