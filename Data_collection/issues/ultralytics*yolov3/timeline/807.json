the same results. Fused and unfused convs receive nearly identical results. \r\nBut this is because when BN is used, the bias in conv is usually canceled, like in models.py:\r\n```\r\n            modules.add_module('Conv2d', nn.Conv2d(in_channels=output_filters[-1],\r\n                                                   out_channels=filters,\r\n                                                   kernel_size=size,\r\n                                                   stride=stride,\r\n                                                   padding=pad,\r\n                                                   groups=int(mdef['groups']) if 'groups' in mdef else 1,\r\n                                                   bias=not bn))\r\n            if bn:\r\n                modules.add_module('BatchNorm2d', nn.BatchNorm2d(filters, momentum=0.1))\r\n```\r\nThe fuse code only fail when **conv_with_bias_before_bn**, which normally can be avoided. So I just think the code is not rigorous enough.\r\nThere are the errors in purpose. Insert random bias in model's first conv:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n        # Get detections\r\n        img = torch.from_numpy(img).to(device)\r\n        if img.ndimension() == 3:\r\n            img =
