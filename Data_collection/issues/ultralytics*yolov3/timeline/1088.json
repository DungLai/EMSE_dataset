👋 hi, thanks for letting us know about this possible problem with YOLOv5 🚀. We've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started investigating a possible problem.\r\n\r\n## How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nWhen asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces the problem should be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible to produce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Complete** – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem\r\n\r\nFor [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code should also be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been solved in [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master).\r\n- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible using official YOLOv5 code without changes. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.\r\n\r\nIf you believe your problem meets all the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) with a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better understand and diagnose your problem. \r\n\r\nThank you!

👋 hi, thanks for letting us know about this possible problem with YOLOv5 🚀. We've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to start investigating a possible problem.\r\n\r\n## How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nWhen asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces the problem should be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible to produce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Complete** – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem\r\n\r\nFor [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code should also be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been solved in [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master).\r\n- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible using official YOLOv5 code without changes. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.\r\n\r\nIf you believe your problem meets all the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) with a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better understand and diagnose your problem. \r\n\r\nThank you! 😃","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1356825031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8064159039,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM4kFCfUzwAAAAHgqU0_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/8064159039","actor":{"login":"hu324","id":105959469,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlDQLQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105959469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324","html_url":"https://github.com/hu324","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-18T15:47:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8064159040,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM4kFCfUzwAAAAHgqU1A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/8064159040","actor":{"login":"hu324","id":105959469,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlDQLQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105959469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324","html_url":"https://github.com/hu324","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hu324/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-18T15:47:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
