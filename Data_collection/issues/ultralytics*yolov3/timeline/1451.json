## ❔Question\r\n> 'Yolov3-spp-ultralytics' is the best, I want to add SE attention base on it, but I have a problem, as follows:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> $python train.py --batch-size 8 --cfg

train.py --batch-size 8 --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-attention.cfg --weights weights/darknet53.conv.74`, but success.\r\n> I want to add SE attention base on 'Yolov3-spp-ultralytics', also pre-weights
