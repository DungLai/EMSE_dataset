the only freezing that we've noticed happens occasionally at the start of training during the NMS phase of testing. In certain configurations up to tens of thousands of FPs may be generated per image, causing NMS to take a very, very long time, up to 12 hours for full 5k.txt test set on COCO. \r\n\r\nIt seems the same thing happened to you, but in your case the underlying cause was a divergence in the `wh` loss terms. These are width and height of the bounding boxes, you can see they explode to 1e16 over the training. I think it could be that the wh divergence is more sensetive in transfer learning for whatever reason. One simple solution is to reduce the wh hyperparameter in the beginning of train.py. If you divide it by 2 for example, or by 4, this should keep the wh terms stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/494346650/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2355790828,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM1NTc5MDgyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2355790828","actor":{"login":"dkendall100","id":43619961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE5OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43619961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100","html_url":"https://github.com/dkendall100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-21T11:09:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2355790831,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNTU3OTA4MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2355790831","actor":{"login":"dkendall100","id":43619961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE5OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43619961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100","html_url":"https://github.com/dkendall100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-21T11:09:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2371964232,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM3MTk2NDIzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2371964232","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-28T14:12:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comm
