Yes this repo currently calculates mAP per image, and then takes the mean mAP across all images, which seems to overestimate mAP as compared to the pycocotools method. I've seen it said this mAP calculation may be the VOC way isntead of the COCO way.\r\n\r\nThe `--save-json` flag in test.py outputs a cocoapi compliant json file and then uses pycocotools to calculate the mAP as well though, so you can always compute official COCO mAP that way instead. For more info you'd want to dig through the pycocotools repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/472938033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2203950222,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIwMzk1MDIyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2203950222","actor":{"login":"guagen","id":34730469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzMwNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34730469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen","html_url":"https://github.com/guagen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T16:07:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2203950225,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMDM5NTAyMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2203950225","actor":{"login":"guagen","id":34730469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzMwNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34730469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen","html_url":"https://github.com/guagen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-14T16:07:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2205317417,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNTMxNzQxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2205317417","actor":{"login":"guagen","id":34730469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzMwNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34730469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen","html_url":"https://github.com/guagen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guagen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-15T02:30:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
