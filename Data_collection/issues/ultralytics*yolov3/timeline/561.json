So I tried to replace pytorch1.4 with 1.2 as you suggested. But it says \"AttributeError: module 'torch.jit' has no attribute 'unused'\". Seems to be another problem arguing pytorch version is too old. Is there any solution without changeing pytorch version?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/606659655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flyingmrwang","id":18489060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDg5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18489060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang","html_url":"https://github.com/flyingmrwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyingmrwang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/606799410","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/561#issuecomment-606799410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/561","id":606799410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjc5OTQxMA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-31T18:34:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T18:34:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@flyingmrwang onnx model fuses obj and cls confidences.
