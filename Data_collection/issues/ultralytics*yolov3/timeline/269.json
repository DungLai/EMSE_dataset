I'm not sure the reason. I tried playing around a bit before also with no success. \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, single GPU speed is the fastest we've seen: 0.20 seconds for 16 images is only incredible <13 ms inference time per image (!), or 80 FPS.\r\n\r\nThe training may be IO constrained. Currently if there are < 1000 training images they are all loaded into memory at the beginning of training, if not they are loaded as they are needed. So for example if you have 2 GPUs and you want to load (and decompress) 160 images per second, your SSD or hard drive may be the bottleneck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/491236502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2332680317,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMzMjY4MDMxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2332680317","actor":{"login":"murrdpirate","id":7863152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjMxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7863152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate","html_url":"https://github.com/murrdpirate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-10T10:09:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2332680319,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMzI2ODAzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2332680319","actor":{"login":"murrdpirate","id":7863152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjMxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7863152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate","html_url":"https://github.com/murrdpirate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murrdpirate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-10T10:09:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/491252048","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269#issuecomment-491252048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269","id":491252048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTI1MjA0OA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T11:11:12Z","updated_at":"2

have two 1080ti graphics cards.

I checked the motherboards manual and it supports multiple gpu's. Also did some stress tests on the gpu's and everything turned out to be fine. Only thing that bothers me is when i check in the terminal on how many pci lanes they are running it says 16x on both, but in the manual it says if using multiple gpu's they should use 8x lanes.
