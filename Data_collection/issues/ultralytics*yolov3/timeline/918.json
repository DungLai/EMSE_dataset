Yes we leave them in there as the same cfg can be reused in darknet. Inference operations will be identical, but training will be different. All training settings are defined with the argparser arguments in train.py, and in the hyperparameter dictionary `hyps` in train.py.\r\n2. Yes there is an image size definition in the Darknet class. This is used when exporting to ONNX, as the ONNX trace does not work well with dynamically defined shapes like s=x.shape. Thus these shapes are passed in and interpreted as constants during ONNX export. Again, the shape is defined at the argparser argument during ONNX export, this tiime from detect.py.\r\n3. Yes and no. 3 additional random images are added to each image to form a mosaic, but the effective img-size is not increased, so much of the 4 images are occluded. The center of the mosaic can range from 0-img-size in each dimension, so no additional area is gained by the mosaic. But in terms of dataloading yes, the entire dataset is loaded 4X per epoch. The speed effects are minimal in most cases if 8 dataloaders are used.\r\n4. Yes, there are hyperparameters and settings used in calculating the loss function in train.py and test.py, so model is a convenient way to pass these to the loss function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597776128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3119890980,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzExOTg5MDk4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3119890980","actor":{"login":"MauroPfister","id":48028499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDI4NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48028499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister","html_url":"https://github.com/MauroPfister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T17:48:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3119890984,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMTk4OTA5ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3119890984","actor":{"login":"MauroPfister","id":48028499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDI4NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48028499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister","html_url":"https://github.com/MauroPfister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T17:48:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/600551671","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/918#issuecomment-600551671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/918","id":600551671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDU1MTY3MQ==","user":{"login":"MauroPfister","id":48028499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDI4NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48028499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister","html_url":"https://github.com/MauroPfister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T

Please let me know, if you want me to open another issue for them.\r\n\r\n1. I would like to replicate more or less the training procedure of the original yolov3 paper. Is there a list of changes you made with respect to the original darknet yolov3? I'm aware of the GIoU loss, different hyper parameters and mosaic training. \r\n2. Is there a reason why you're not using [torchvision transforms](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) for the whole image augmentation pipeline? They seem handy but I'm quite new to Pytorch and might be overlooking something.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the
