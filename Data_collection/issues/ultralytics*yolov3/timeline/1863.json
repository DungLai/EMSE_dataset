select_device operates correctly, you probably missed the section of the function where CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is set.\r\n\r\nWe've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started investigating a possible problem.\r\n\r\n## How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nWhen asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces the problem should be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible to produce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Complete** – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce the problem\r\n- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem\r\n\r\nFor [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code should also be:\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been solved in [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master).\r\n- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible using official YOLOv5 code without changes. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.\r\n\r\nIf you believe your problem meets all the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) with a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better understand and diagnose your problem. \r\n\r\nThank you!
