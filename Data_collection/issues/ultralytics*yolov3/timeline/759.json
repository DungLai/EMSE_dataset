When I read the cfg files, I meet two questions.\r\n> \r\n> First, in the yolov3-spp.cfg, I notice that the pad of 1×1convolution is 1. If filled with1, the feature map dimension will decreasae. But I think 1×1convolution should not change feature map width and height. How to understand this?\r\n> \r\n> Second, I found the accuracy of yolov3-spp is higher than the yolov3. Assume the input is 416×416×3, the network will detect on 13×13, 26×26 and 52×52. Why SPP is only used on feature maps at 13×13 scale?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks and look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nSorry, I didn't notice the parse of network. Now I know the first issue. Can you solve my second question?
