There are zero differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n@glenn-jocher Ok, that's great; I think I get confused when I check my run and saw \"Fusing layers... Model Summary: **261 layers**, 61922845 parameters, 0 gradients\"  \r\n\r\n \r\n Actually, I have another question if that possible, is there any way to calculate the localization only regardless of how the model does in the classification task? Because I tray various learning paradigms with the model and I want to know if these methods enhance the localization performance of the model? \r\nCan I do that by increasing the IoU threshold, or better, I used localization metrics like [Localization Recall Precision (LRP)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Kemal_Oksuz_Localization_Recall_Precision_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)?\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your quick response, and I am really interested to share my results with you soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/914697690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Diana2313","id":86285023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1MDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313","html_url":"https://github.com/Diana2313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5268511614,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6Bxt-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5268511614","actor":{"login":"Diana2313","id":86285023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1MDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313","html_url":"https://github.com/Diana2313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-07T23:40:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5268511616,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6BxuA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5268511616","actor":{"login":"Diana2313","id":86285023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1MDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313","html_url":"https://github.com/Diana2313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-07T23:40:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5268586908,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6CEGc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5268586908","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-08T00:00:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5268586912,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6CEGg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5268586912","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"no

test data?\r\n\r\n2-Also I can see that you used GIoU as a loss function is this also used as a metric for evaluating the model on the test data?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/915265427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Diana2313","id":86285023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1MDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313","html_url":"https://github.com/Diana2313","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Diana2313/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5272535318,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6RIEW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5272535318","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-08T14:00:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5272535326,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM47CB7izwAAAAE6RIEe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5272535326","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-08T14:00:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/915277094","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1828#issuecomment-915277094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1828","id":915277094,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM42jgUm","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T14:13:34Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T14:13:34Z","author_association":"MEM
