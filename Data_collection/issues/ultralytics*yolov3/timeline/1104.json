I've already turn to pytorch1.4 and the problem got fixed! Now I can start training, but sometimes I will got `segmentation fault (core dumped)` error.

But when I sampled more data(from the same source) around 500k, I will get the error.\r\n\r\nI guess it's a kind of memory access error, but I don't know where and why.
