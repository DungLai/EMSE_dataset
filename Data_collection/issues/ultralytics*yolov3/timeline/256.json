the bug**\r\nI have tried using test.py to get mAP scores for the yolov3-tiny.weights model, and the score I get is 0.177 - much lower than the 0.331 that is claimed by the original author of yolo for that model.\r\nNote I have not been able to try the full sized (yolov3.weights) model as I haven't yet been able to access a GPU big enough to cope with it yet, so I can't say if there is the same issue with that model or not.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI used the commit d526ce0d118fcbbfae3e73d9627183b95ceb2b26 (after the mAP updates were merged).\r\nI then followed instructions as in the

hey have you found a way to train the yolov3 tiny using the pretrained weihgts? I am getting around 24mAP and it seems not going to increase...Thank you!!\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11752039/62934569-c5b53800-bdbc-11e9-89e6-8078aff31a64.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/520779132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiao1228","id":11752039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzUyMDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11752039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228","html_url":"https://github.com/xiao1228","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao1228/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2552896684,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU1Mjg5NjY4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2552896684","actor":{"login":"shekharshank","id":3200787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDA3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3200787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank","html_url":"https://github.com/shekharshank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T10:24:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2552896685,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NTI4OTY2ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2552896685","actor":{"login":"shekharshank","id":3200787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDA3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3200787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank","html_url":"https://github.com/shekharshank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekharshank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T10:24:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/521194061","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/256#issuecomment-521194061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/256","id":521194061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTE5NDA2MQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_eve
