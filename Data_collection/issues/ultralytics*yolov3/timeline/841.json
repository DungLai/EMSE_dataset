have the same question as @melih1996. I summarized the important parts (which regards to this question) from the YOLOv1 Paper.\r\n![Unbenannt_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26065101/76239671-41cc0d00-6232-11ea-822a-f3de512b455c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn models.py (line 155-171) I found this code:\r\n```\r\nclass YOLOLayer(nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self, anchors, nc, img_size, yolo_index, arc):\r\n        super(YOLOLayer, self).__init__()\r\n\r\n        self.anchors = torch.Tensor(anchors)\r\n        self.na = len(anchors)  # number of anchors (3)\r\n        self.nc = nc  # number of classes (80)\r\n        self.no = nc + 5  # number of outputs\r\n        self.nx = 0  # initialize number of x gridpoints\r\n        self.ny = 0  # initialize number of y gridpoints\r\n        self.arc = arc\r\n\r\n        if ONNX_EXPORT:  # grids must be computed in __init__\r\n            stride = [32, 16, 8][yolo_index]  # stride of this layer\r\n            nx = int(img_size[1] / stride)  # number x grid points\r\n            ny = int(img_size[0] / stride)  # number y grid points\r\n            create_grids(self, img_size, (nx, ny))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like, your S is called self.nx and self.ny and if ONNX_EXPORT is True, then your answer from above is totally right. But there is no else-case. In your forward-method there is a method called `create_grids`. It seems like this method does the job and S is in the default mode 13. Is it useful to change this value if we have other image sizes than e.g. COCO (since for Pascal the YOLOv1 authors used S=7). Or is changing the anchor sizes equivalent to adjust this S respective self.nx and self.ny?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/596657977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Deep-Learner","id":26065101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDY1MTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26065101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner","html_url":"https://github.com/Deep-Learner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3111585125,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzExMTU4NTEyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3111585125","actor":{"login":"melih1996","id":34304254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzA0MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34304254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996","html_url":"https://github.com/melih1996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T17:09:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3111585132,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMTE1ODUxMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3111585132","actor":{"login":"melih1996","id":34304254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzA0MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34304254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996","html_url":"https://github.com/melih1996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melih1996/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-09T17:09:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/596676238","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/841#issuecomment-596676238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/841","id":596676238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjY3NjIzOA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T17:41:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T17:44:18Z","author_association":"MEMB
