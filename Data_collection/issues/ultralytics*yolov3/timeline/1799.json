it's an open question really.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is obviously working well, the real question is if there is an alternative implementation that might work better.\r\n\r\ncls and box loss apply losses for all anchor-target matches, whereas obj loss operates differently, it currently only applies a single loss if multiple matches are made.\r\n\r\nWe could write code to treat obj similarly to cls and box, though I don't know what effect that might have (i.e. could lead to higher rate of FPs without lowering the obj hyperparameter gain down), as typically one target will have a high multiplicity (especially in YOLOv5) with perhaps 3-6 anchors matching
