They apply NMS as a matrix operation to remove the `for` loop, which they say runs much faster with a minimum mAP penalty. \r\n\r\nDepending on the conf-thres used, NMS may or may not be a very expensive operation in this repo. For most actual use applications with conf-thres around 0.1-0.9, NMS is not a speed concern, taking <10% of the total processing time for an image, but when calculating mAP near conf-thres = 0.0001 for example, NMS may take up 90% of the processing time.\r\n\r\nIf you can try to implement a fast NMS experiment here that would be very useful. The NMS function is here.

Can you point us to the location in your code where the function is? Can we use it for boxes rather than masks?\r\n\r\nWe currently use multi-class `torchvision.ops.boxes.batched_nms()` (middle row) as a compromise between speed and accuracy. We apply it once per image (all classes at once), and see an inference speed of 49ms/img (inference + NMS) at 608 image size, `conf_thresh=0.001` on a Tesla T4, giving us about 42.0/62.0 mAP@0.5/0.5...0.95 on COCO2014. We do not do masks though, only boxes.\r\n\r\nBTW, we also developed the `merge` nms method below, which is slower simply because it is implemented in python rather than C, but it may be possible to combine `fast` and `merge` together to get the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nNMS method | Time<br>s/img |Time<br>mm:ss |mAP<br>@0.5:0.95 |mAP<br>@0.5 \r\n---  | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\n`'vision_batched', multi_cls=False` | **46ms** |**3:50** |41.2 |60.8\r\n`'vision_batched', multi_cls=True` | 49ms |4:03 |41.9 |61.8\r\n`'merge', multi_cls=True` | 120ms |9:58 |**42.3** |**62.0**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbolya/yolact/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbolya/yolact/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/594354022","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/679#issuecomment-594354022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/679","id":594354022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDM1NDAyMg==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T06:42:09Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T06:42:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Update: I discovered a majority of time in test.py was spent building pycocotools JSON files for official mAPs.
