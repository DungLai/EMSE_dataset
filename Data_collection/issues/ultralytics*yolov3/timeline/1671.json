Thank you very much for clearing that up. I found out what was slowing my code down. When I used your repository to train a custom yolov3 detector, I did not fully follow the detect.py code but used another repository's code. As a result, my model was always running at FP32 and I used quite a lot of try and expect codes which masked the errors when I tried to run in FP16 mode.  While the mAPs are same, I am seeing 2x inference speed up with Jetson Xavier NX which is now running at stable 15~18 FPS. Thanks again for the
