I have tested it with crops of 1920x384 pixels and since its fully conv it seems to work fine. The gain in GPU memory is massive. I can upload the code if you will, the bad thing is that I am using an old version of this repository (2-3 months old).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/485096255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"100330706","id":48351782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzUxNzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48351782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706","html_url":"https://github.com/100330706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100330706/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2289461590,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4OTQ2MTU5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2289461590","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-20T11:21:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2289461591,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODk0NjE1OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2289461591","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-20T11:21:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/485246076","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/126#issuecomment-485246076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/126","id":485246076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTI0NjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T12:02:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T12:0

Yes, this seems like a good idea, though you would still need to letterbox to the nearest 32x image size multiple no?\r\n\r\nYes, the image size, even though that in this case is rectangular, has to be multiple of 32. Since the dataset I am dealing with only has static-size images of 1920x400 px, rather than letterboxing, I just re-scale all of them to 1920x384 px to achieve 32x compatiblity since the distortion is minimum.

However, your point seems pretty nice and for sure doing this will ease the training. I guess than the shuffling will be someway affected by this.
