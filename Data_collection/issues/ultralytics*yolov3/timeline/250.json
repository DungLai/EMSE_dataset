This is an automated response. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # git clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, Pytorch >= 1.0, etc. \r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.
