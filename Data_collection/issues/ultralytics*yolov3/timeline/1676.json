Thank you for the answer. I understand that those 3 parameters vary depending on different datasets. \r\n\r\nOne quick clarification is that yolov3.pt has been trained with the default value of img-size 640x640 and hence img-size of 640x640 is the most optimized in that **training sample** (not **testing sample**, so img-size may vary when making inference). However, for iou-thres and conf-thres, these values are not used in training the pre-trained network yolov3.pt as I don't see these 2 parameters in train.py and hence these are not coming from training, but I believe these two values are specific to running the tracker if I am

I couldn't find the information of how the yolov3.pt has been trained from README or other issues, so would like to confirm.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to hear any other parameters how yolov3.pt has been trained such as epoch, batch size etc. From train.py I see that default value is 300 epochs, batch size of 16, 640x640 image size, but wasn't sure if these values are used for training yolov3.pt with coco.yaml (I see default of coco128.yaml for only 128 images of training). Note that my goal is to use the existing best pre-trained model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/778531640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4327240746,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDMyNzI0MDc0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4327240746","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-13T00:49:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4327240755,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzMjcyNDA3NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4327240755","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-13T00:49:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/778551935","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1676#issuecomment-778551935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1676","id":778551935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODU1MTkzNQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"
