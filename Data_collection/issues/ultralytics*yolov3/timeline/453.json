Thanks a lot for the repository. I am trying to find tiny yolov3 weights with correct mask.\r\n\r\nThe weights file at - https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights was trained with incorrect mask 1,2,3 instead of 0,1,2 (refer issue - https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/851).\r\nWhen I use the same weights file with this repository with mask 0,1,2 - I get mAP 0.178 with 0.001 conf threshold (0.153 with 0.1). However, when I change  the mask in cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg to -  1,2,3 I get the expected mAP of 0.332 with 0.001 conf threshold (0.278 with 0.1) \r\n \r\nSo, now I am trying train a model on my own with - yolov3-tiny.conv.15 as the seed. However, after 75 epochs, mAP with 0.1 confidence threshold 0.1 is still 0.207. I am using the ultralytics default hyperparameters. If you could provide any suggestions how to improve the performance, it would be very welcome. \r\nIf there is any other trained yolov3-tiny weights that I can use, that will be great too. I tried the models from this location - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxgUBemJVw9wZsdpboYbzUN4bcRhsuAI, but it seems they have the same model weights as the darknet repo.\r\n\r\nResults - \r\n[results.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/files/3143640/results.txt)\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2582023729,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjU4MjAyMzcyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2582023729","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-25T16:46:25Z","rename":{"from":"'val Confidence' overfitting on j-series hyperparameters","to":"'val Objectness' overfitting on j-series hyperparameters"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/524644970","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/453#issuecomment-524644970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/453","id":524644970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDY0NDk3MA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-25T16:47:10Z","updated_at":"2019-08-25T16:47:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another example.
