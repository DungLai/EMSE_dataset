By the way I found a  repo that performs that implemantation [https://github.com/penolove/yolov3-tensorrt](url), it has a cfg parser so you can convert your yolo to onnx and then to tensorrt. However it has some problems, you might need to edit the code. I tested this on my gtx 1050 by optimizing to use 2 GB of memory, it processed a single image in 3 seconds without rescaling bounding boxes to original image size. Didnt go any further yet.
