**Section 2.2** of [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640), I have a few questions about the loss calculation shown at the end of this issue.\r\n\r\n1. We are using `λ coord = 5` from line 156 to line 159. Should we also use `λ noobj = .5` in line 167?\r\n\r\n2. Why are we multiplying BCELoss with `1.5` in line 160? I have not found any reference to this in the papers.\r\n\r\n3. `pred_conf` gives us a `[batch_size x anchor_number x grid_size x grid_size]` tensor. Assuming `batch_size = 1`,  `anchor_number=3` and `grid_size = 2`, there are 12 elements in this tensor. If `nM = 3`, `pred_conf[~mask]` contains 9 elements, so does `mask[~mask].float()`. `BCEWithLogitsLoss1` gives the sum of BCE loss for these 9 elements, whereas `BCEWithLogitsLoss2` takes the mean of  `BCEWithLogitsLoss1` (i.e. divides it by 9 for our case). Now, my question is why are we multiplying `BCEWithLogitsLoss2` with `nM` instead of using `BCEWithLogitsLoss1` (should divide by batch_size too prob.) in line 167? There is no division in **Section 2.2** of [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640). Btw,  `pred_conf[~mask]` could contain 15k elements normally, so we are practically ignoring the confidence loss in line 167.\r\n\r\n4. Similar to 3, we should use `BCEWithLogitsLoss1` (should divide by batch_size too prob.) in line 163. Because\r\n`BCEWithLogitsLoss1(pred_cls[mask], tcls.float()) / BCEWithLogitsLoss2(pred_cls[mask], tcls.float()) =  batch_size x nM x number_of_classes`.\r\n\r\n5. Why are we not dividing all the losses by  the `batch_size`? As the `batch_size` increases, the loss increases too. However, we should minimize the expected loss per sample.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/9514e7443891ab2eaa106292a041cb0b8770f7c3/models.py#L155-L167","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/12/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/428584585","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/3#issuecomment-428584585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/3","id":428584585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODU4NDU4NQ==","user":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T14:03:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T14:03:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"While this is true, in theory, it is also clearly stated in the YOLOv3 paper that BCE is a big part of the models' general success (in COCO and PASCAL-VOC). \r\nLooking at models.py I am actually not sure the commented out lines _do that_.
