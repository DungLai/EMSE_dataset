your yolov3 version,and you gave suggestions in [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1395](url)\r\nhow to fix this bug in yolov5 whose model has changed?\r\nanother question is my` test_batch0_pred.jpg`didn't prediction anything.I  **use  different sizes images to train the new network**,is that  reason caused the error?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/696926187","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/883#issuecomment-696926187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/883","id":696926187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjkyNjE4Nw==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T19:16:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T19:16:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If
