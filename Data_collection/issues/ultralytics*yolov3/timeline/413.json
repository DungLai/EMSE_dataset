Wow lol in only 20 epochs,  it seems so unlikely. \r\nOther Questions\r\n1. Anyways, I have figured out how to run detect.py with the webcam, however it does not identify any objects and is very slow. Is there any way I can speed it up? \r\n\r\n2. What about identifying my custom object on my Iphone. How would I go by doing this? \r\n\r\n3. Is it possible to use my phone as a webcam? I plan on using my custom object for future A.I projects. \r\n\r\nNeed to know if any of this is possible.

ah I forgot, when you specify weights in detect.py or test.py you also need to specify the *.cfg file that corresponds, so the correct commands would be:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 detect.py --webcam --weights weights/yolov3-tiny.weights --cfg cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg\r\npython3 detect.py --webcam --weights weights/yolov3-tiny.weights --cfg cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg--img-size 320\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/517375475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2527264861,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUyNzI2NDg2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2527264861","actor":{"login":"FeatheryW","id":22216921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjE2OTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22216921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW","html_url":"https://github.com/FeatheryW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T17:06:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2527264863,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MjcyNjQ4NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2527264863","actor":{"login":"FeatheryW","id":22216921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjE2OTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22216921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW","html_url":"https://github.com/FeatheryW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-01T17:06:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/517388019","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/413#issuecomment-517388019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/413","id":517388019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM4ODAxOQ==","user":{"login":"FeatheryW","id":22216921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjE2OTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22216921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW","html_url":"https://github.com/FeatheryW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeatheryW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T17:40:46Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T20:03:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher
