Hello @jaskiratsingh2000, thank you for your interest in YOLOv3 🚀! Please visit our ⭐️ [Tutorials](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki#tutorials) to get started, where you can find quickstart guides for simple tasks like [Custom Data Training](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) all the way to advanced concepts like [Hyperparameter Evolution](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/607).\n\nIf this is a 🐛 Bug Report, please provide screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**, otherwise we can not help you.\n\nIf this is a custom training ❓ Question, please provide as much information as possible, including dataset images, training logs, screenshots, and a public link to online [W&B logging](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data#visualize) if available.\n\nFor business inquiries or professional support requests please visit https://www.ultralytics.com or email Glenn Jocher at glenn.jocher@ultralytics.com.\n\n## Requirements\n\nPython 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, including `torch>=1.7`. To install run:\n```bash\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Environments\n\nYOLOv3 may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments (with all dependencies including [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda)/[CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):\n\n- **Google Colab and Kaggle** notebooks with free GPU: <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov3\"><img src=\"https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg\" alt=\"Open In Kaggle\"></a>\n- **Google Cloud** Deep Learning VM. See [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart)\n- **Amazon** Deep Learning AMI. See [AWS Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/AWS-Quickstart)\n- **Docker Image**. See [Docker Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Docker-Quickstart) <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/yolov3?logo=docker\" alt=\"Docker Pulls\"></a>\n\n\n## Status\n\n![CI CPU testing](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/workflows/CI%20CPU%20testing/badge.svg)\n\nIf this badge is green, all [YOLOv3 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/actions) Continuous Integration (CI) tests are currently passing. CI tests verify correct operation of YOLOv3 training ([train.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/train.py)), testing ([test.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/test.py)), inference ([detect.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/detect.py)) and export ([export.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/models/export.py)) on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu every 24 hours and on every
