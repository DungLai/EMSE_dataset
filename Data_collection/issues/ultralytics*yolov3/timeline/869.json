he entire resized image, as well as the letterboxed padding areas are used during training.\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply. I'm facing an interesting problem on my job. We are training a model with one class only. We have more then 45k images annotated. It's the same object, but in different sizes. Two problems are more urgent to understand and solver. The first one is bad detection. The model is detecting some people as the wished object. In the validation and test step, we got great precision and recall. But, as I said, the model is detecting humans too. We have humans in our dataset, but they aren't annotated. And it's seems the model is learn things about the environment (it's the second question: is it possible the model learning about the environment and, some case, make bad detection? ).\r\nTo improve the precision, we use to use negative images too. And in that case, we have more humans images. \r\nOne second approach we are thinking is to annotate humans too and training the model with two classes. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/591054599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adrianosantospb","id":6961152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjExNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb","html_url":"https://github.com/adrianosantospb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianosantospb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/591074809","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/869#issuecomment-591074809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/869","id":591074809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTA3NDgwOQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T21:20:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T21:20:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@adrianosantospb  thank you for your interest in our work!
