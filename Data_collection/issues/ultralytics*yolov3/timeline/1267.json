yes of course, there are many ways to do this. The most common is to keep the model loaded onto a listener thread, which monitors the batch for changes, and then runs inference upon change detection. The actual batch is constructed by separate background threads which monitor sources of interest, i.e. rtsp feeds or folder contents etc.\r\n\r\nWe've developed and deployed many such systems, including systems in active use today in the retail industry for example.
