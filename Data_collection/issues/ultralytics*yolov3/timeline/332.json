Rectangular inference is already on by default in test.py and detect.py, no changes needed. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/232\r\n\r\n`img_size` represents the longest dimension if rectangular inference is used. You can leave a new model initialized with random weights rather than a backbone (i.e. darknet53) if you would like to structure your own network. darknet53 is used as the backbone to help start training on more normal yolov3 variants like yolov3-spp etc.\r\n\r\nTo detect with rectangular inference simply run `python3 detect.py`. To train with rectangular inference set the flag in the code here and run `python3 train.py` etc. (`git pull` to get the latest).\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/bb3682024efb6ecde7de937d427419b989763b22/train.py#L142-L149\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/502311725/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2415088776,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQxNTA4ODc3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2415088776","actor":{"login":"furkankirac","id":11700647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzAwNjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11700647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac","html_url":"https://github.com/furkankirac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-14T23:39:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2415088778,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MTUwODg3Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2415088778","actor":{"login":"furkankirac","id":11700647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzAwNjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11700647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac","html_url":"https://github.com/furkankirac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furkankirac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-14T23:39:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2438315463,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQzODMxNTQ2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2438315463","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-25T17:14:01Z","state_re
