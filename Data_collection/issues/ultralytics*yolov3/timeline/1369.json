👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about **handling inference results**. YOLOv5 🚀 [PyTorch Hub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) models allow for simple model loading and inference in a pure python environment without using `detect.py`, and allow for easy results export to JSON.\r\n\r\n### Simple Inference Example\r\n\r\nThis example loads a pretrained YOLOv5s model from PyTorch Hub as `model` and passes an image for inference. `'yolov5s'` is the YOLOv5 'small' model. For details on all available models please see the [README](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints). Custom models can also be loaded, including custom trained PyTorch models and their [exported](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/251) variants, i.e. ONNX, TensorRT, TensorFlow, OpenVINO YOLOv5 models.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# Model\r\nmodel = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # or yolov5m, yolov5l, yolov5x, etc.\r\n# model =

@yangboz 👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about **handling inference results**. YOLOv5 🚀 [PyTorch Hub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) models allow for simple model loading and inference in a pure python environment without using `detect.py`, and allow for easy results export to JSON.\r\n> \r\n> ### Simple Inference Example\r\n> This example loads a pretrained YOLOv5s model from PyTorch Hub as `model` and passes an image for inference. `'yolov5s'` is the YOLOv5 'small' model. For details on all available models please see the [README](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints). Custom models can also be loaded, including custom trained PyTorch models and their [exported](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/251) variants, i.e. ONNX, TensorRT, TensorFlow, OpenVINO YOLOv5 models.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> import torch\r\n> \r\n> # Model\r\n> model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # or yolov5m, yolov5l, yolov5x, etc.\r\n> # model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', 'path/to/best.pt')  # custom trained model\r\n> \r\n> # Images\r\n> im = 'https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg'  # or file, Path, URL, PIL, OpenCV, numpy, list\r\n> \r\n> # Inference\r\n> results = model(im)\r\n> \r\n> # Results\r\n> results.print()  # or .show(), .save(), .crop(), .pandas(), etc.\r\n> \r\n> results.xyxy[0]  # im predictions (tensor)\r\n> results.pandas().xyxy[0]  # im predictions (pandas)\r\n> #      xmin    ymin    xmax   ymax  confidence  class    name\r\n> # 0  749.50   43.50  1148.0  704.5    0.874023      0  person\r\n> # 2  114.75  195.75  1095.0  708.0    0.624512      0  person\r\n> # 3  986.00  304.00  1028.0  420.0    0.286865     27     tie\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"\" width=\"550\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/149679662-b2021c78-59b2-4f52-b768-1e5161537c85.png\">\r\n> \r\n> See [YOLOv5 PyTorch Hub Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) for details.\r\n> \r\n> Good luck 🍀 and let us know if you have any other questions!\r\n\r\nand the returned  results.pandas().xyxy[0]has  value_counts()  then tojson  str then   json.loads as json object for API usage. it takes about  0.1s ,  any idea to speed it up?
