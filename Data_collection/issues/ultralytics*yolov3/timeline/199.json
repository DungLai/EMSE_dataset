First though, **`git pull` to align your repo with the current version**, you are several commits behind I see.\r\n\r\n1. Darknet trains to 500200 batches at 64 images per batch, which works out to 273 epochs. It also uses several tricks to get their reported mAP, included an LR scheduler and multi-scale training, which you have not done. I suggest you do some research on the topic.\r\n\r\n2. The mAP computed during training is at `conf_thres 0.1` for speed. To get proper test mAP you need to run test.py --weights weights/best.pt, which will compute mAP at `conf_thres 0.001`. This usually increases the reported mAP about 5%.\r\n\r\n3. The plots shown in the README, which you are presumably referring to (you did not specify a source) are very old, which incorrect mAP computations. I've removed them and updated them with the custom training wiki results:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/55669383-df76c980-5876-11e9-9806-691bd507ee17.jpg)\r\n\r\n4. The optimal loss function formulation for this repo is not yet known. Default darknet loss does not produce very good results, at least for the first few epochs we have tested it. You are free to tune hyperparameters and adjust the loss function to search for improvements as well. We could use all the help we can get in terms of GPU time. The main differences between this repo and darknet currently are CE vs BCE loss for classification, and the exact loss constants used for the terms xy, wh, cls, conf.
