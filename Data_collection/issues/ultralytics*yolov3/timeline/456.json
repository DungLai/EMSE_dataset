❔Question\r\nHello, thanks a lot for your great work, I really appreciate it! I have a question regarding the implementation of yolov3. According to [this](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/456) and [this issue](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/511), yolov3 resizes the images to imgsz * imgsz duing training, unless --rect is used, but test.py and detect.py automatically uses rectangular inference. So that means that the size of images at test time can be different from the size of images used for training, and that images of different sizes can be used for inference. Am I correct? If yes, how does that work exactly? Wouldn't changing the size of images at test time make the shape of the outputs of the final layer different? I tried to read through the code but couldn't find the part where this is made possible. I would greatly appreciate it if you could explain how this works. Thank you very much!\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
