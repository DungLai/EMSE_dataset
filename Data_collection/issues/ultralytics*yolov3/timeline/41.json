This repo will save checkpoints as `latest.pt` and `best.pt`, and also every 5 epochs i.e. `backup_5.pt`. If I understand, you trained to 80 epochs, so you should have `backup_80.pt` saved. Did you get COCO mAP with this weightfile?\r\n\r\nYou say you changed the resize function in pytorch, can you show your changes?
