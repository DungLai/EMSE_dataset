This requires hundreds of evolved generations to produce optimal hyperparameters on your dataset.\r\n\r\nThe rough rule of thumb is that all of your loss components should contribute proportionally to their share of the output solution, so if you believe that obj, box and cls are all equally important outputs, they should produce roughly equal losses at the start of training. Adjust your cls accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/569768751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2914528092,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkxNDUyODA5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2914528092","actor":{"login":"Broad-sky","id":46519564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTE5NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46519564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky","html_url":"https://github.com/Broad-sky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-30T19:15:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2914528093,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MTQ1MjgwOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2914528093","actor":{"login":"Broad-sky","id":46519564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTE5NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46519564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky","html_url":"https://github.com/Broad-sky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-30T19:15:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/569851721","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/745#issuecomment-569851721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/745","id":569851721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTg1MTcyMQ==","user":{"login":"Broad-sky","id":46519564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTE5NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46519564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky","html_url":"https://github.com/Broad-sky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Broad-sky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T02:46:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T02:47:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is
