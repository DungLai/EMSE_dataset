You must remove the backbone by using `--weights ''`, or specify a weights-cfg combination that is compatible.\r\n\r\nThis error is caused by a user supplying incompatible `--weights` and `--cfg` arguments. To solve this you must specify no weights (i.e. random initialization of the model) using `--weights ''` and any `--cfg`, or use a `--cfg` that is compatible with your `--weights`. If none are specified, the defaults are `--weights ultralytics49.pt` and `--cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg`.\r\n\r\nCompatible `--weights --cfg` combinations:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3.weights --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3-spp.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights ultralytics49.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights ultralytics68.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To train from scratch** (randomly initialized weights), use:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --weights '' --cfg cfg/*.cfg  # any cfg will work here\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ultralytics49.pt` is currently the highest performing YOLOv3 model (trained from scratch using this repo) available at the default `img-size` of 416 (see https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310), which is the reason it is used as the default backbone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/558334674/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2829583801,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgyOTU4MzgwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2829583801","actor":{"login":"Samjith888","id":39676803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njc2ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39676803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888","html_url":"https://github.com/Samjith888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-25T20:51:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2829583803,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4Mjk1ODM4MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2829583803","actor":{"login":"Samjith888","id":39676803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njc2ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39676803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888","html_url":"https://github.com/Samjith888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samjith888/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-25T20:51:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T21:00:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T21:00:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ult
