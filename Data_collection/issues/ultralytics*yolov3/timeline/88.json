For some reason I thought PEP8 was 120 character-line compliant, since PyCharm defaults to this line wrap length when running their default reformatter. It turns out PyCharm does not enforce PEP8 line length by default though.\r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/reformatting-source-code.html\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I wrote the whole repo with 120 character lines in mind, so the YAPF reformat really destroys much of the carefully crafted code I had written over the last year. \r\n\r\nIf YAPF is really industry standard then logically I should adopt it as well for maximal readability and commonality. Perhaps there is some manual reformatting I can do to reduce the impact of the change prior to the switchover.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/462159082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/462205191","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/88#issuecomment-462205191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/88","id":462205191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjIwNTE5MQ==","user":{"login":"Ttayu","id":32290119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjkwMTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32290119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ttayu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T02:23:14Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T02:23:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
