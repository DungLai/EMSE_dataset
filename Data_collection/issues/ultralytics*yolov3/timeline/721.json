You can still launch 4 different training on the 4 gpus if you have enough RAM, CPU and a decent cooling system. Could be great to do hyperparameters search.\r\n> If you really want to do multi gpu training, your best bet is to boot in linux (a vm or a docker on windows wont work since they wont have access to the gpus)\r\n\r\nthank you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/567291158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wallcuber","id":58249279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ5Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58249279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber","html_url":"https://github.com/wallcuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/575302254","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/721#issuecomment-575302254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/721","id":575302254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTMwMjI1NA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T19:17:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T19:17:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll close this issue for now as the original issue appears to have been resolved, and/or no activity has been seen for some time.
