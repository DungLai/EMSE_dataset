thanks for the insightful comments here! Yes you are correct, there is no normalization going on here, this is simply a **rescaling** from 0 - 255 to 0.0 - 1.0.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started with simple convolution networks, i.e. MNIST, I did normalization of the input images by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation. This leaves the resultant dataset at zero mean and unity variance.\r\n\r\nIn YOLOv3 this process seems to be taken care of by the `batch_norm2d` layers. These layers carry a running mean and a running variance of the pixel values passing through them, and normalize the network values as they pass from one layer to another, not just at the input as you describe but at multiple locations throughout the network (73 locations in yolov3-spp).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/486798251/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2301186355,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwMTE4NjM1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2301186355","actor":{"login":"dbarrejon","id":12476037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc2MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12476037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon","html_url":"https://github.com/dbarrejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-25T19:01:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2301186357,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDExODYzNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2301186357","actor":{"login":"dbarrejon","id":12476037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc2MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12476037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon","html_url":"https://github.com/dbarrejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-25T19:01:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/486987996","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/241#issuecomment-486987996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/241","id":486987996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Njk4Nzk5Ng==","user":{"login":"dbarrejon","id":12476037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc2MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12476037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon","html_url":"https://github.com/dbarrejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:15:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T09:15:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher

COCO.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/486999648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2302620854,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwMjYyMDg1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2302620854","actor":{"login":"dbarrejon","id":12476037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc2MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12476037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon","html_url":"https://github.com/dbarrejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:50:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302620855,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDI2MjA4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2302620855","actor":{"login":"dbarrejon","id":12476037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDc2MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12476037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon","html_url":"https://github.com/dbarrejon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbarrejon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T09:50:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2306422806,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwNjQyMjgwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2306422806","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-29T11:36:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597410994","html_url":"https://github.com/ult

I would have several questions:\r\n\r\n- If I happen to deploy a network on hardware, which requires mean = 0 and std_dev = 128 for each image dim s.t. out_im = (in_im - mean)/std_dev, how should I train the network? I am a bit confused: I have a pre-trained backbone network which was trained on Imagenet, and input images were pre-processed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the std_dev. \r\nThen, the actual detector is trained on another dataset by considering again the same kind of preprocessing, i.e. by subtracting from the input images the mean and diving by the std_dev of the new dataset. This should be correct in terms of matching. Yet, at the time of inference, how should I preprocess the input image?\r\n\r\n- Do you mean that if the network supports batch normalization you don't need to pre-process the input images as aforementioned? And why YOLO is nevertheless doing a scaling by a factor 255?\r\n\r\n- Basically, I would need the input images to be in the range [0,2] for deployment, thus 0 mean and std_dev = 128 for each channel. I have batch normalization in my backbone network. How should I behave according to you?\r\n\r\nSorry but I am a bit of inexperienced\r\n\r\nThank you!
