Assuming you trained for detection rather than for tracking, if many frames / images contain same ground truth bounding boxes (i.e. same pedestrians in multiple images), did you discard some images or include all of them for training?Did you write kmeans yourself or did you use this one?  https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/scripts/gen_anchors.py

Because there are only 400 annotated frames in my dataset, I use all to fine-tune the model.  But you should discard some redundant frames to avoid overfitting when you get many frames at high fps (>= 20) in your videos. For example, you can use the difference between frame-i and frame-(i+1) as a threshold to filter redundant frames. I used kmeans.py from https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3/blob/master/kmeans.py.
