inference with that python line, **the main goal I folow is to understand about the output tensor of .onnx model** and why the numbers of the array by using the official Yolo repo [1,2500,7] or others I have seen at some places. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm needing is to parse that output tensor (in C sharp) so I want to understand its form, there are ways to generate 4 tensors or 3 tensors as I explained before. Even I made a representative document with each visualization at netron.app for different configurations of export.py. \r\n\r\nBut that's my particular case, I'm just asking for some information about the output tensor form and its values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1252180623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matiassalriv1998","id":108749614,"node_id":"U_kgDOBntjLg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108749614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998","html_url":"https://github.com/matiassalriv1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7421081356,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM43sihkzwAAAAG6VLcM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/7421081356","actor":{"login":"matiassalriv1998","id":108749614,"node_id":"U_kgDOBntjLg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108749614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998","html_url":"https://github.com/matiassalriv1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-20T10:53:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7421081365,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM43sihkzwAAAAG6VLcV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/7421081365","actor":{"login":"matiassalriv1998","id":108749614,"node_id":"U_kgDOBntjLg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108749614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998","html_url":"https://github.com/matiassalriv1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-20T10:53:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1252183731","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1800#issuecomment-1252183731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1800","id":1252183731,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM5Kos6z","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com

But at least now I have some understanding about the tensor values.\r\n\r\nI hope this have helped someone :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1254880439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matiassalriv1998","id":108749614,"node_id":"U_kgDOBntjLg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108749614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998","html_url":"https://github.com/matiassalriv1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiassalriv1998/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7438604299,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM43sihkzwAAAAG7YBgL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/7438604299","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-22T11:16:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7438604302,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM43sihkzwAAAAG7YBgO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/7438604302","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-22T11:16:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
