training results seem fine, though you are plotting the result of 5 training runs in a row. The latest repo has code to remove an old results.txt file before starting training of a new run, so you should not be seeing all 5 runs. In any case you can just open your results.txt file and delete the first 4 runs and plot only the fifth that would be much more helpful.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the training and test image, you are providing bounding boxes that are partly off the image, which is not recommended. Also, in terms of your training batch, you have to remember that a CNN like YOLOv3 is generally meant to reproduce human-capable tasks. If a human can not complete your task, it is unlikely that YOLOv3 will be able to either, and looking at your training pictures I don't think a human would be able to correctly learn and label these sorts of

The other possibility is you simply don't have sufficient data. You want at least 5000 optimizer updates, with a nominal batch size of 64, so ideally in 100 epochs you would see at least 300,000 images. You may need to train for more epochs if your image count is lower than this.\r\n\r\nAn ideal minimum dataset for example might contain >=3000 images, and train to 100 epochs, at 3000/64 = 47 batches per epoch.\r\n\r\nIf you have 1000 images, you should train to 300 epochs, and 100 images train to 3000 epochs etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/514230416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2503242983,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUwMzI0Mjk4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2503242983","actor":{"login":"sanazss","id":43985794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss","html_url":"https://github.com/sanazss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-23T14:19:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2503242985,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MDMyNDI5ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2503242985","actor":{"login":"sanazss","id":43985794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss","html_url":"https://github.com/sanazss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-23T14:19:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2507960178,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUwNzk2MDE3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2507960178","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T00:11:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
