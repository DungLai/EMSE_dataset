Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # git clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, Pytorch >= 1.1, etc. You can also use our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw) to test your code in working environment.\r\n\r\nIn your case it looks like the OpenCV error occurs in test.py when attempting to plot test_batch0.jpg, which shows you the training data with the labels. It's likely there is an error with your training data somewhere. You can run a validated working example like this and try to debug from there:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --data data/coco_16img.data --epochs 1\r\n\r\nNamespace(accumulate=8, backend='nccl', batch_size=8, cfg='cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg', data_cfg='data/coco_16img.data', dist_url='tcp://127.0.0.1:9999', epochs=1, evolve=False, giou=False, img_size=320, nosave=False, notest=False, num_workers=4,

Note that rectangular training is set to FALSE by default in train.py:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Dataset\r\n    rectangular_training = False\r\n    dataset = LoadImagesAndLabels(train_path,\r\n                                  img_size,\r\n                                  batch_size,\r\n                                  augment=True,\r\n                                  rect=rectangular_training)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas it is set to TRUE by default in test.py (which is called by train.py when called as main):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndataset = LoadImagesAndLabels(test_path, img_size, batch_size)  # Note rect=True by default\r\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset,\r\n                            batch_size=batch_size,\r\n                            num_workers=4,\r\n                            pin_memory=True,\r\n                            collate_fn=dataset.collate_fn)\r\n```\r\nWhen I set rect=False in the call to LoadImagesAndLabels in test.py, the problem is resolved. On the other hand, when I set rectangular training to TRUE in train.py, the problem appears again when cv2.copyMakeBorder is called. It appears to be a bug in the *letterbox* padding calculation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/505560828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bigrobinson","id":42244176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjQ0MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42244176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson","html_url":"https://github.com/bigrobinson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigrobinson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/508713166","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/343#issuecomment-508713166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/343","id":508713166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODcxMzE2Ng==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T10:27:37Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T10:27:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bigrobinson yes, rectangular training is still very much in development, and is not currently compatible with multi-scale training for example.

However, for only 3 class, when I create new dataset from coco datatsets with labels only for those 3 and change the config file as well accordingly, I get the error after 10th epoch:\r\n\r\n10/329     1.57G      5.68      27.5        33      66.2         5       416:  88%|▉| 7/8 [00:01<00:00,  3    10/329     1.57G      5.22      27.3      30.7      63.2        18       416:  88%|▉| 7/8 [00:02<00:00,  3    10/329     1.57G      5.22      27.3      30.7      63.2        18       416: 100%|█| 8/8 [00:02<00:00,  4    10/329     1.57G      5.22      27.3      30.7      63.2        18       416: 100%|█| 8/8 [00:02<00:00,  3.74it/s]                                                                                                                     Class    Images   Targets         P         R   mAP@0.5        F1:   0%| | 0/8 [00:00<?, ?it/s]Traceback (most recent call last):                                                                              File \"train.py\", line 429, in <module>                                                                          train()  # train normally                                                                                   File \"train.py\", line 309, in train                                                                             save_json=final_epoch and epoch > 0 and 'coco.data' in data)                                                File \"/home/paridhi/tci/yolov3/test.py\", line 63, in test                                                       for batch_i, (imgs, targets, paths, shapes) in enumerate(tqdm(dataloader, desc=s)):                         File \"/home/paridhi/my_project/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tqdm/std.py\", line 1091, in __iter__                 for obj in iterable:                                                                                        File \"/home/paridhi/my_project/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py\", line 819, in __next__                                                                                                             return self._process_data(data)                                                                             File \"/home/paridhi/my_project/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py\", line 846, in _process_data                                                                                                        data.reraise()                                                                                              File \"/home/paridhi/my_project/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/_utils.py\", line 385, in reraise               raise self.exc_type(msg)                                                                                  cv2.error: Caught error in DataLoader worker process 0.
