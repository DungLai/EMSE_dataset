think I have solved this problem.  There is an assert in utils:405 to catch when a tag has no labels `assert nf > 0 or n == 20288, 'No labels found in %s. See %s' % (os.path.dirname(file) + os.sep, help_url)`  But I suspect this just looks at the original labels, while later there is some data augmentation cropping/scaling/image manipulation that can then case the only labels to actually be outside the image frame so something will have 0 labels.  Whether or not this is true, I solved this problem by moving the line:\r\n`at = torch.arange(na).view(na, 1).repeat(1, nt)  # anchor tensor, same as .repeat_interleave(nt)` into the if statement on line 437 `        if nt:` so that it gets run after confirming that nt is non-0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/733056709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RorryB","id":47458848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU4ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47458848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB","html_url":"https://github.com/RorryB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RorryB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1335720311","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1377#issuecomment-1335720311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1377","id":1335720311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM5PnXl3","user":{"login":"shenm97","id":74642820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjQyODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74642820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97","html_url":"https://github.com/shenm97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-02T19:31:44Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T19:31:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"请问解决了吗\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/1335720311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shenm97","id":74642820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjQyODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74642820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97","html_url":"https://github.com/shenm97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenm97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
