This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, PyTorch >= 1.4 etc. You can also use our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw) and our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3) to test your code in a working environment.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.

you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597944047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3124877413,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEyNDg3NzQxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3124877413","actor":{"login":"smalldroid","id":237886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid","html_url":"https://github.com/smalldroid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T23:16:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/598473766","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/912#issuecomment-598473766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/912","id":598473766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODQ3Mzc2Ng==","user":{"login":"smalldroid","id":237886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid","html_url":"https://github.com/smalldroid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smalldroid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T23:18:07Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T23:18:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n - OS: ubuntu 18.04\r\n - GPU: Tesla P2000;\r\n - CUDA: 10.2;\r\n - torch: 1.5.1/1.6.0 has the same probelm both;\r\n - apex: 0.1;\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nFollowing [this](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/912) exactly the same problem in yolov3, I have reinstall pytorch/apex pefectly, but problem persists. \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is: when I set `model, optimizer = amp.initialize(model, optimizer, opt_level='O1', verbosity=0)` the `opt_level` option to `O2` or `O0`, problem solved, but the training loss will yield infinite in several steps.\r\n\r\nIf I disable `mixed_precision`, training problem totally solved, hope this will provide some cues for debugging.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/689677593","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/912#issuecomment-689677593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/912","id":689677593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTY3NzU5Mw==","user":{"login":"GreenTeaHua","id":23550850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23550850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua","html_url":"https://github.com/GreenTeaHua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenTeaHua/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T16:33:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T16:33:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"apex
