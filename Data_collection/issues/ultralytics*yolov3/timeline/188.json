Large produces .257, which would roughly correspond to the .33@0.5 you were looking for. If there is a problem in tiny testing then it should show up in detect as well, so I did comparisons of yolov3-tiny inference between this repository and darknet. \r\n\r\nThe anecdotal differences seem minimal in these 5 examples, or even show a slight improvement in this repo compared to darknet. I'm not sure what to say really. The tiny objects seem well detected compared to darknet, i.e. the two people and the kite in kites.jpg. \r\n\r\nOne other possibility is that **perhaps yolov3-tiny tests with very different hyperparameters than yolov3**. `conf_thres`, `nms_thres`, etc. may need to be greatly modified to show improved mAP results (you can run a hyperparameter search yourself). mAP is well validated in yolov3.weights (0.58) and yolov3-spp.weights (0.61) as you can see in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map.\r\n\r\n[ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3)

Obtaining the published yolov3 mAP requires lowering the `conf_thres` down to a ridiculously low 0.001. This reduces precision to about 0.1 (as you can see in the readme mAP section), which means that for every TP there are 9 FPs (yes, **10 false positives for every 1 good match gives you the best mAP**). It's beyond me why everyone fixates on this metric when it's optimized to create garbage results in real world use. I blame the original object detection organizers for creating this mess, though now the blame lies with all of us that continue to use it as well. \r\n\r\ndetect.py uses a much more usable `conf_thres = 0.50`, which is what you see in the pictures above. Setting `conf_thres = 0.001` to get the best mAP produces the actual results below (yes, these actual images produce higher mAP than the images in my previous post).\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't see any significant deviation between the two implementations.\r\n\r\n[ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3) `yolov3-tiny.weights` | [darknet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)
