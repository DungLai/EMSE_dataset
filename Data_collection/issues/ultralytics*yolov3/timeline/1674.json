Yes, I am aware of test.py will compute mAP. However, I seem not able to understand how I can get mAP from test.py for my own custom sequence (sequence of images). I have my own ground truth files (e.g. 500 txt files in a folder) and the result from detect.py of 500 txt files under labels/ folder, where I used pre-trained weight. All I want to do ideally is to get the detection performance for my custom sequence by feeding the path to the ground truth files and results
