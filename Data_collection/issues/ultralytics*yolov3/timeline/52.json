The affine transformation has a scale parameter that zooms in or out the image contents, but it does not change the image size in pixels. Just like your iphone can zoom in 1X or 2X or 10X, and still output the same 8MP image size, the affine scale parameter is analogous to this zoom.\r\n\r\nI suppose for training it is accomplishing a similar effect, except that if the affine transform scales an image by 2X for example, then most of it will disappear off the edges, and only the centermost area will remain, whereas `--multi-scale` from 320 to 608 will result in the same image contents, just at a higher resolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/448768531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/448920432","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/52#issuecomment-448920432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/52","id":448920432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODkyMDQzMg==","user":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-20T08:50:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T08:50:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As @glenn-jocher  said - just scaling (but keeping image size constant) will result in cropping the image at random locations.
