You are using the ensemble approach then, with an AND requirement.\r\n\r\nWe had a request from someone else for mutli-scale inference (sometimes referred to as test-time inference). The idea would be to run inference at several scales (using the same model), and then return the merged result. This might work for you too.\r\n\r\nFP reduction is one of the main challenge in many production systems. I think for video analysis you may really need to add a time dimension to your code, for example to require >3 detections within a trailing time window before any of them are saved, because an actual detection should be repeatable, whereas an FP may tend to be more transient in nature.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this would be to reshape your video streams, instead of streaming one image at a time, batch 30 frames togethor and use logic to only save detections that occur several times in the same batch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597809710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3120118692,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzEyMDExODY5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3120118692","actor":{"login":"fontiano","id":61554427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTU0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61554427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano","html_url":"https://github.com/fontiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fontiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T18:56:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
