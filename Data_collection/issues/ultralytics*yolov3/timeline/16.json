added support for yolov3-tiny using the maxpool layer (and implementing a fix to the routing layer, and modifying the stride calculation in models.py yolo forward) in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/51, so if yolov3-spp was suffering from issues before perhaps these are now resolved as well. I'll try to run inference with yolov3-spp and see the result now:\r\n\r\n`python3 detect.py --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg --weights weights/yolov3.weights`\r\n![dog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/50374709-150ee400-05f3-11e9-94a1-4214cb2bdff8.jpg)\r\n![zidane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/50374710-150ee400-05f3-11e9-9eff-cf1d56c808bf.jpg)\r\n\r\n`python3 detect.py --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg --weights weights/yolov3-spp.weights`\r\n![dog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/50374715-27891d80-05f3-11e9-9c06-70f76f2cc65e.jpg)\r\n![zidane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/50374716-27891d80-05f3-11e9-9fd3-dc1d4702fd77.jpg)\r\n\r\nOk, results look comparable to yolov3. Well **SPP certainly seems to be working**, though this limited anecdotal evidence makes it hard to conclude whether it represents an improvement over standard yolov3, or if there are pytorch implementation issues. To resolve implementation issues I must compare against darknet directly. I'll try that now. Hmm, ok still inconclusive. \r\n\r\n`./darknet detect cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights
