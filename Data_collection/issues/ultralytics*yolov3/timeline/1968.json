I'd recommend using https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. You can train YOLOv3 models there as well using yolov3.yaml.\r\n\r\nFrom the YOLOv5 custom training tutorial:\r\n\r\n👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about YOLOv5 🚀 **dataset formatting**. To train correctly your data must be in YOLOv5 format. Please see our [Train Custom Data](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) tutorial for full documentation on dataset setup and all steps required to start training your first model. A few excerpts from the tutorial:\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Create dataset.yaml\r\n\r\n[COCO128](https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/coco128) is an example small tutorial dataset composed of the first 128 images in [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home) train2017. These same 128 images are used for both training and validation to verify our training pipeline is capable of overfitting. [data/coco128.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco128.yaml), shown below, is the dataset config file that defines 1) the dataset root directory `path` and relative paths to `train` / `val` / `test` image directories (or *.txt files with image paths) and 2) a class `names` dictionary:\r\n```yaml\r\n# Train/val/test sets as 1) dir: path/to/imgs, 2) file: path/to/imgs.txt, or 3) list: [path/to/imgs1, path/to/imgs2, ..]\r\npath: ../datasets/coco128  # dataset root dir\r\ntrain: images/train2017  # train images (relative to 'path') 128 images\r\nval: images/train2017  # val images (relative to 'path') 128 images\r\ntest:  # test images (optional)\r\n\r\n# Classes (80 COCO classes)\r\nnames:\r\n  0: person\r\n  1: bicycle\r\n  2: car\r\n  ...\r\n  77: teddy bear\r\n  78: hair drier\r\n  79: toothbrush\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Create Labels\r\n\r\nAfter using a tool like [Roboflow Annotate](https://roboflow.com/annotate?ref=ultralytics) to label your images, export your labels to **YOLO format**, with one `*.txt` file per image (if no objects in image, no `*.txt` file is required). The `*.txt` file specifications are:\r\n\r\n- One row per object\r\n- Each row is `class x_center y_center width height` format.\r\n- Box coordinates must be in **normalized xywh** format (from 0 - 1). If your boxes are in pixels, divide `x_center` and `width` by image width, and `y_center` and `height` by image height.\r\n- Class numbers are zero-indexed (start from 0).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"750\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/91506361-c7965000-e886-11ea-8291-c72b98c25eec.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\nThe label file corresponding to the above image contains 2 persons (class `0`) and a tie (class `27`):\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"428\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/112467037-d2568c00-8d66-11eb-8796-55402ac0d62f.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.3 Organize Directories\r\n\r\nOrganize your train and val images and labels according to the example below. YOLOv5 assumes  `/coco128` is inside a `/datasets` directory **next to** the `/yolov5` directory. **YOLOv5 locates labels automatically for each image** by replacing the last instance of `/images/` in each image path with `/labels/`. For example:\r\n```bash\r\n../datasets/coco128/images/im0.jpg  # image\r\n../datasets/coco128/labels/im0.txt  # label\r\n```\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"700\"
