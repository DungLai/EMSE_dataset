👋 Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your modified or out-of-date code**. If your issue is not reproducible in a new `git clone` version of this repo we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and verify your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 yolov5_new  # clone latest\r\n$ cd yolov5_new\r\n$ python detect.py  # verify detection\r\n\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible in one of our 3 common datasets ([COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco.yaml), [COCO128](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco128.yaml), or [VOC](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/voc.yaml)) we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of your labels and images.\r\n\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, verify your environment meets all of the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies specified below. If in doubt, download Python 3.8.0 from https://www.python.org/, create a new [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), and install requirements.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your issue.
