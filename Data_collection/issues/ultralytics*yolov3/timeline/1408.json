reference my YOLOv5 comments here for the benefit of all the local YOLOv3 watchers.\r\n\r\n> The original yolo/darknet box equations have a serious flaw.

The current eqn constrains anchor multiples from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 4, and the anchor-target matching has also been updated to be width-height multiple based, with a nominal upper
