I did not comment this area sufficiently, I will do a commit to better explain this. This section assigns the closest grid point `gi`, `gj`, and anchor `a` to each target, to ensure that each grid-anchor point is only assigned to one target.\r\n\r\nMy first technique to do this was to select unique rows from the n x 3 `[gi, gj, a]` matrix using:\r\n``` python\r\nu = torch.cat((gi, gj, a), 0).view(3, -1).numpy()\r\n_, first_unique_slow = np.unique(u[:, iou_order], axis=1, return_index=True)  # first unique indices\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut during profiling I found np.unique was slow in selecting unique _rows_, so I merged the 3 columns into a single column by the dot product of a random 1 x 3 vector (the 3 random constants you see here). This produced much faster np.unique results.\r\n``` python\r\nu = gi.float() * 0.4361538773074043 + gj.float() * 0.28012496588736746 + a.float() * 0.6627147212460307\r\n_, first_unique = np.unique(u[iou_order], return_index=True)  # first unique indices\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested the two methods for accuracy using this line, and found differences extremely rare... but wait these are both sorted, and the output used later on is not sorted. Ok I will look into this some more to see the effect of the sorting.\r\n```python\r\nprint(((np.sort(first_unique_slow) - np.sort(first_unique)) ** 2).sum())\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/419716248/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/419719084","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/8#issuecomment-419719084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/8","id":419719084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTcxOTA4NA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-09T14:19:45Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T14:22:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes I've confirmed there is is a bug here.
