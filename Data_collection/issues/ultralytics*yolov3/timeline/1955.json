### Search before asking\r\n> * [x]  I have searched the YOLOv3 [issues](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/discussions) and found no similar questions.\r\n> \r\n> ### Question\r\n> Hello author,\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for your contribution. I have some questions about the label or GT for YOLOV3.\r\n> \r\n> After reviewing the code in loss.py (build_targets and compute loss).\r\n> \r\n> My understanding is as follows:\r\n> \r\n> One GT from label file (annotation txt file) would be converted to be targets in 3 different prediction layers. Then it would be filtered by the ratio which is provided by self.hyp['anchor_t']. So there might be a case that one GT to be converted as a target in different anchors from different layers. When calculating loss, all these targets would be counted.\r\n> \r\n> If I understand correctly, how the model will be learned to predict the correct size?(I know this already has been approved to be True, I just dont understand )\r\n> \r\n> Thanks,\r\n> \r\n> ZD\r\n> \r\n> ### Additional\r\n> _No response_\r\n\r\nWe will caculate the iou.So,although there's 3 feature layers and 9 anchors,the loss between GT and the best predbox is the max one.
