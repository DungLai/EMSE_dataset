The printed imformation during train phase is:\r\n```\r\n              Class    Images   Targets         P         R       mAP        F1\r\n                 all  2.40e+03   6.9e+03     0.893     0.863      0.84     0.878\r\n```\r\nHowever, with default arguments, the results of test.py don't looks this good, and detect.py only show a littile detections.\r\n\r\nI noticed that this phenomenon may be caused by different conf-thres configment in the three codes, which is 0.1 in train.py, 0.001 in test.py, 0.5 in detect.py.\r\n\r\nThis different may cause:\r\n- Good performance shown in train.py\r\n- Lower P in test.py than train.py\r\n- Lower R in detect.py than train.py\r\n\r\nBesides, I also noticed that inference of my model has low confidence, what can I do to improve this? Is simply resume training this model okay? Or I should modify the loss hyps?\r\n\r\nBTW, I also also noticed that the 1st batch in either train phase or detect phase costs far more time than others, is this regular?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/235/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/489206054","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/239#issuecomment-489206054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/239","id":489206054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTIwNjA1NA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-03T19:04:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T21:21:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hktxt a low confidence bug was fixed for single-class situations, see #235.
