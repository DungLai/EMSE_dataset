From your darknet link I think the correct burnin in formula is this, which will slowly ramp up the LR to 1e-3 after 1000 iterations and leave it there:\r\n```python\r\n# SGD burn-in\r\nif (epoch == 0) & (i <= 1000):\r\n    power = ??\r\n    lr = 1e-3 * (i / 1000) ** power\r\n    for g in optimizer.param_groups:\r\n        g['lr'] = lr\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't find the correct value of power though. I tried with `power=2` and training diverged around 200 iterations. Increasing to `power=5` training diverges after 400 iterations. `power=10` also diverges. \r\n\r\nI see that the divergence is in the width and height losses, the other terms appear fine. I think one problem may be that the width and height terms are bound at zero at the bottom, but are unbound at the top, so its possible that the network is predicting impossibly large widths and heights, causing the losses there to diverge. I may need to bound these or redefine the width and height terms and try again. I used a variant of the width and height terms for a different project that had no divergence problems with SGD.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/422995636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1856393474,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg1NjM5MzQ3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1856393474","actor":{"login":"xyutao","id":42927482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTI3NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42927482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao","html_url":"https://github.com/xyutao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-19T23:57:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1856393475,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NTYzOTM0NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1856393475","actor":{"login":"xyutao","id":42927482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTI3NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42927482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao","html_url":"https://github.com/xyutao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-19T23:57:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/423050023","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/4#issuecomment-423050023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/4","id":423050023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzA1MDAyMw==","user":{"login":"xyutao","id":42927482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTI3NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42927482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao","html_url":"https://github.com/xyutao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyutao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-20T06:00:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T06:00:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher

weights.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sanazss","id":43985794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss","html_url":"https://github.com/sanazss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanazss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T09:51:48Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T09:51:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/404","id":473957283,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzM5NTcyODM=","number":404,"title":"error

This example scenario above should actually favor Adam, since Adam is known for reducing training losses moreso than validation losses (and then failing to generalize well), because the dataset trains and validates on the same images, but SGD still clearly outperforms it.\r\n\r\nCan you plot a comparison using your custom dataset?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/522314718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2564418048,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU2NDQxODA0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2564418048","actor":{"login":"kieranstrobel","id":46137709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTM3NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46137709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel","html_url":"https://github.com/kieranstrobel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-18T11:47:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564418049,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NjQ0MTgwNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2564418049","actor":{"login":"kieranstrobel","id":46137709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTM3NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46137709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel","html_url":"https://github.com/kieranstrobel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieranstrobel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-18T11:47:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
