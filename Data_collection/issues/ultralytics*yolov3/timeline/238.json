steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/489349822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2319165386,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMxOTE2NTM4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2319165386","actor":{"login":"announce1","id":30942131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTQyMTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30942131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1","html_url":"https://github.com/announce1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T17:56:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2319165387,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMTkxNjUzODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2319165387","actor":{"login":"announce1","id":30942131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTQyMTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30942131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1","html_url":"https://github.com/announce1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-04T17:56:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/489401563","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238#issuecomment-489401563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238","id":489401563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQwMTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"announce1","id":30942131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTQyMTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30942131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1","html_url":"https://github.com/announce1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/announce1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-05T08:04:21Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T08:04:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

I ran an interesting experiment recently. Using the iDetection app, I set up an iPhone to view a street for one hour and record the all the detections for later analysis. This recorded about 400,000 detections over 100,000 video frames (3600s at an average of 20 FPS). The model used was https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-spp.weights, exported to PyTorch > ONNX > CoreML in a 192 x 320 width-height shape, with 6x10, 12x20, 24x40 grids. The results worked amazingly well, but it also uncovered a effect I'd never noticed before. \r\n\r\nIn my layover below, you can actually see the YOLOv3 grids, because for some reason there are no detections near the grid boundaries (those histogram cells are all zero). \r\n\r\nAlso equally fascinating you can see that the middle grid is used for up-close pedestrians, because I can count 12 grids across nearest to the camera, while you can actually visualize the transition to the largest 24-across grid far away.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is have you ever seen any issues at the grid intersection areas before, such as reduced recall? There are a lot of effects at play here, so the cause may not be in the `yolov3-spp.weights` themselves, but perhaps the PyTorch inference model, or the CoreML export. I'm fairly confident that the PyTorch and Darknet inference is practically identical however, due to identical test mAPs.\r\n\r\nSingle Frame | 2D Histogram over 1 hour\r\n--- | ---

Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # git clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, Pytorch >= 1.1, etc. You can also use our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw) to test your code in working environment.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.
