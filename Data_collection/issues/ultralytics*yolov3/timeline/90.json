I fixed your #2, yes good catch. The dictionary was named the same as the string, poor coding on my part. \r\n\r\n#1 will take a bit of effort to resolve, as there are various areas around the code that stitch together path names under the linux assumption. But you are not the first one to mention this. I will leave the comment open until I resolve this, presumably through the more liberal use of, `os.path.join()` and `os.sep()`.\r\n\r\nAbout your last comment I had not heard this from anyone else yet, so I will leave as is for now.

I updated `detect.py` to be fully Windows compatible now, using the pathlib standard library suggested by @Ttayu. I replaced your line in question with the following os agnostic shutil command.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/7d5878872cc3902023e550f8b97a062d7717c9f1/detect.py#L25-L26\r\n\r\nAre there any other incompatibilities in `test.py` or `train.py` you found? Thanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/462843789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2134341294,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzNDM0MTI5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2134341294","actor":{"login":"rtrahms","id":2120238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjAyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2120238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms","html_url":"https://github.com/rtrahms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-12T17:02:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2134341295,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzQzNDEyOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2134341295","actor":{"login":"rtrahms","id":2120238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjAyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2120238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms","html_url":"https://github.com/rtrahms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtrahms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-12T17:02:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2134341296,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjEzNDM0MTI5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2134341296","actor":{"login":"Ttayu","id":32290119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjkwMTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32290119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ttayu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ttayu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-12T17:02:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2134341297,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMzQzNDEyOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2134341297","actor":{"login":"Ttayu","id":32290119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjkwMTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubu
