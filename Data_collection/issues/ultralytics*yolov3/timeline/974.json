an experiment, I added bias to all the conv layers. It turns out that the instability problem early on in training vanishes for me. So no need for burnin, i don't get any NaN or Inf losses/gradients even when using diou or ciou losses (ciou uses atan2 which can give you some infinities during training). The motivation was that adding biases barely adds to overall weights, i don't think it impacts computational speed too much and biases converge faster (or at least they are most stable to higher learning rates).
