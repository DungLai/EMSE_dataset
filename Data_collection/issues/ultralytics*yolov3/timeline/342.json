I'd also considered modifying hyperparameters as a function of time/epoch, but this sort of tuning would take even longer, as right now each hyperparameter mutation is tested after only 1 epoch. \r\n\r\nThis is quite a frustrating problem in general due to the long training time of a single network. 273 epochs on a V100 takes about 1 week, making it very hard to quickly see the effect of changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/507750316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2454963047,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1NDk2MzA0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2454963047","actor":{"login":"rayjan0114","id":47523852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTIzODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47523852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114","html_url":"https://github.com/rayjan0114","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T16:26:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2454963048,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTQ5NjMwNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2454963048","actor":{"login":"rayjan0114","id":47523852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTIzODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47523852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114","html_url":"https://github.com/rayjan0114","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T16:26:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/638152222","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/342#issuecomment-638152222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/342","id":638152222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODE1MjIyMg==","user":{"login":"tim20120526","id":43242086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQyMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43242086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526","html_url":"https://github.com/tim20120526","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tim20120526/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T12:02:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T12:02:44Z","author_associ
