Typically what you see if people get empirical results and then try to write a storyline to explain the results. In the end its mostly just a lot of trial and error.\r\n\r\nAbout sigmoid, yes, I'm aiming to move the entire detection layer output to sigmoid to increase stability and remove nan errors that people sometimes experience on custom datasets. The current wh exp() output is a bit of a problem in that sense as it is unbounded and unstable.\r\n\r\nI think the handoff from one grid point to another is a real problem, especially for smaller objects, which do not have redundant output layers. In any case, inference with the --augment flag should minimize this problem currently, though of course it uses a lot more flops. It would be nice to find a partial overlap implementation that minimizes the issue with a single forward pass.\r\n\r\nYes alexeyab and I and a few others contribute ideas back and forth, but I am only loosely affiliated with yolov4, and am actually aiming to launch an improved version which is largely unrelated to it.
