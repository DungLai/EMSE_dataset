@Ricardozzf I've not tried to continue training from the official yolov3 weights. It probably won't pick up smoothly where Joseph Redmon and company left off for a number of reasons, such as the optimizer starting with no knowledge of the previous optimizer's momentum and LR. There are also a few primary differences between my training and the official darknet training:\r\n\r\n- Issue #4: `train.py` uses the **Adam optimizer in place of SGD**. I could not get SGD to converge with the yolov3 learning rate.\r\n- **Non Maximal Suppression (NMS) is not applied during training**, so precision may appear artificially low while training, as many of the False Positives (FPs) in the denominator term P = TP / (TP + FP) are eliminated during testing but not training.\r\n- Issue #3:  I use **CrossEntropyLoss in place of BinaryCrossEntropyLoss for classification loss during training.** I made this change after observing better performance with CE vs BCE (I don't understand the reason for this, as darknet uses BCE). These two loss terms are on line 162 and 163 of `models.py`. Note that BCEWithLogitsLoss that I use produces the same loss as BinaryCrossEntropyLoss + `torch.sigmoid()` on the first term, but BCEWithLogitsLoss is preferable for numerical stability reasons. **If you want to try to continue training from yolov3.weights you need to use BinaryCrossEntropy or BCEWithLogitsLoss** as in the commented line below.\r\n``` python\r\nlcls = nM * CrossEntropyLoss(pred_cls[mask], torch.argmax(tcls, 1))\r\n# lcls = nM * BCEWithLogitsLoss2(pred_cls[mask], tcls.float())\r\n```\r\n\r\n@lianuo how many epochs did you train this way? If you make the switch the BCE does this help?\r\n\r\n@Ricardozzf your results don't look good. Are you training from scratch or resuming training from yolov3 weights like @lianuo?  If you suspect class confidence has a problem it must be because I've swapped CE for BCE. You can switch BCE back on by switching the commented lines above. But also note that if you are training from scratch you need significant number of epochs before things start looking good. In my training I see about 0.50 mAP on COCO2014 validate set after 40 epochs (3 days of training on a 1080 Ti).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/418339885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1825075622,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNTA3NTYyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1825075622","actor":{"login":"lianuo","id":28760530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzYwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28760530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo","html_url":"https://github.com/lianuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T11:56:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1825075623,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MjUwNzU2MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1825075623","actor":{"login":"lianuo","id":28760530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzYwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28760530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo","html_url":"https://github.com/lianuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T11:56:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1825075624,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNTA3NTYyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1825075624","actor":{"login":"Ricardozzf","id":30193946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkzOTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30193946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf","html_url":"https://github.com/Ricardozzf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T11:56:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1825075625,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MjUwNzU2MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1825075625","actor":{"login":"Ricardozzf","id":30193946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkzO

If I run `test.py` I see this:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n+ Sample [4998/5024] AP: 0.7528 (0.4926)\r\n+ Sample [4999/5024] AP: 0.8333 (0.4927)\r\n+ Sample [5000/5024] AP: 0.5543 (0.4927)\r\nMean Average Precision: 0.4927\r\n```\r\nIf I then use the epoch 37 checkpoint `latest.pt` with `detect.py` I see this on my example image, which is the same problem you guys are seeing. \r\n![zidane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/45094160-ca885b00-b11a-11e8-896e-450af6b707c4.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if I caused this by switching from BCE to CE. In xView when I used this code I had to increase my `-conf_thresh` in `detect.py` to ~0.99 to reduce FP. If I increase `-conf_thresh` to 0.99 now (and change `-nms_thresh` to 0.45 to match `test.py`) then I get this. Better, but still not quite right.\r\n\r\n![zidane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/45094248-0de2c980-b11b-11e8-9112-382f77f317a8.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a bit apples and oranges comparison though. The official weights are at 160 epochs and my `latest.pt` is only at 37 epochs, so its possible that training up to 160 will resolve this problem. \r\n\r\nI don't understand why test.py is producing such a high mAP though, especially since it uses a very low `-conf_thresh` of 0.5. You guys are right, there is an unresolved issue somewhere. I will try and investigate more. The problem seems twofold:\r\n\r\n1. Issue #5: `test.py` is possibly over-reporting mAP on trained checkpoints, even though it correctly reports mAP on the official YOLOv3 weights, an odd inconsistency. This seems to be the easiest issue to resolve, so I'll look at this first.\r\n2. Trained weights seem to require much higher confidence thresholds (~0.99) than typically used in YOLOv3 (~0.8 commonly). This would seem to be unrelated to the CE vs BCE issue, as @lianuo trained from epoch 160 using BCE and still saw poor results.\r\n\r\nAny ideas are appreciated as well!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/418720224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1827757737,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNzc1NzczNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1827757737","actor":{"login":"Ricardozzf","id":30193946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkzOTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30193946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf","html_url":"https://github.com/Ricardozzf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T12:56:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1827757739,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4Mjc3NTc3Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1827757739","actor":{"login":"Ricardozzf","id":30193946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkzOTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30193946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf","html_url":"https://github.com/Ricardozzf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ricardozzf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T12:56:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1827780960,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNzc4MDk2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1827780960","actor":{"login":"lianuo","id":28760530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzYwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28760530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo","html_url":"https://github.com/lianuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianuo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T13:06:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1827780961,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4Mjc3ODA5NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1827780961","actor":{"login
