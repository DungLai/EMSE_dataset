The mAPs reported at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map are using the darknet trained `yolov3-spp.weights` file. You can reproduce these with the code at the link. \r\n\r\nIf you train using this repo you get pytorch weights in a *.pt format. The training results are constantly improving, with the latest results coming within 1% of darknet trained results. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310 for a more detailed discussion.\r\n\r\nIn relation to your exact question regarding the relationship of multiscale with final mAP, the correlation is debatable. Darknet training uses it by default, but **I have not observed any improvement when testing at the same resolution as your training `img_size`**. It may help, but I can't say I've observed anything consistent with that being the case. Testing at other resolutions it should obviously help, so I believe it depends on your final intended use of the trained model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/524821460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2583356366,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU4MzM1NjM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2583356366","actor":{"login":"nerminsamet","id":25280525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25280525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet","html_url":"https://github.com/nerminsamet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-26T11:17:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2583356368,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1ODMzNTYzNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2583356368","actor":{"login":"nerminsamet","id":25280525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25280525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet","html_url":"https://github.com/nerminsamet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-26T11:17:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/524821798","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/472#issuecomment-524821798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/472","id":524821798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDgyMTc5OA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T11:19:18Z","updated_at":"20

ah, excellent, you are committed in your training. I'll share a few tricks briefly. We typically develop based on small dataset results, like coco_16img.data, which allows rapid prototyping since training only takes a few minutes. This is useful for sanity checks and rough ideas, but results here do not correlate fully with results on the full coco dataset, so once we develop an idea on a small dataset we test it on 1 or 2 full coco epochs to tweak further, and then we test to 10% full training for a full statistical comparison. We do all this at 320 for speed, and with yolov3-spp since it bumps mAP by 1% at almost no compute expense. These are now reaching 45% mAP after 27 epochs at 320 (no multi-scale). You can see some studies we've done at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/441#issuecomment-520229791\r\n\r\nThe 10% training command we use is:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --weights weights/darknet53.conv.74 --img-size 320 --epochs 27 --batch-size 64 --accumulate 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've also had a weight_decay bug in place which we just fixed today, which seems to greatly impact performance:

know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/525734391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2590443489,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU5MDQ0MzQ4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2590443489","actor":{"login":"nerminsamet","id":25280525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25280525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet","html_url":"https://github.com/nerminsamet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T13:00:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2590443492,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1OTA0NDM0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2590443492","actor":{"login":"nerminsamet","id":25280525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25280525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet","html_url":"https://github.com/nerminsamet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerminsamet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-28T13:00:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/525740792","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/472#issuecomment-525740792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/472","id":525740792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTc0MDc5Mg==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-28T13:17:18Z","updated_at":"201

I think we can use the results below (320 with multiscale) as a proxy for what you might expect. It looks like multiscale reduces the overfitting a bit, but I believe the real culprit are the positive weights in the two BCELosses.
