that's an interesting approach. I'm not a quantization expert, but you should be aware that quantization does not automatically produce faster speeds in most circumstances. Only in a very limited set of circumstances, when the hardware backend, the runtime environment, the firmware/drivers (like AVX512) etc. all align properly to enable exploitation of quantized operations would you see any improvement.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA GPUs prior to Ampere do not see any speed improvements in FP16 vs FP32 operations for example (1080Ti, P100, etc.). The Apple Neural Engine (ANE) will execute models at the same speed regardless of quantization: FP32, FP16, FP8 models all run at the same speed in iDetection on iOS.\r\n\r\nThe quantization approach you used is interesting though, do you have links or tutorials that explain how to use it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/816667850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4574338147,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU3NDMzODE0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4574338147","actor":{"login":"m-agathe","id":82212876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjEyODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82212876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe","html_url":"https://github.com/m-agathe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T13:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4574338152,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NzQzMzgxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4574338152","actor":{"login":"m-agathe","id":82212876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjEyODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82212876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe","html_url":"https://github.com/m-agathe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-agathe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T13:05:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/835956505","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1734#issuecomment-835956505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1734","id":835956505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTk1NjUwNQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"cre
