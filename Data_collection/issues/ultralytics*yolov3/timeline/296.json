This is an automated response. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # git clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, Pytorch >= 1.0, etc. \r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.

It happens intermittently after ~50 epochs and several hours of training when it's starting to train on a new batch (after a validation batch). Using multi-processing with  DataLoader parameters num_workers=3, persistent_workers=True. Similar errors reported here: https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/oserror-errno-22-invalid-argument-pickle-unpicklingerror-pickle-data-was-truncated/138469/2, https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/296. I had the same error on previous versions of Pytorch and Python. They happen on both GPUs - usually if I'm training one model on one GPU and one on another. Plenty of available RAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyTorch version: 1.10.0+cu113\r\nIs debug build: False\r\nCUDA used to build PyTorch: 11.3\r\nROCM used to build PyTorch: N/A\r\n\r\nOS: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro for Workstations\r\nGCC version: Could not collect\r\nClang version: Could not collect\r\nCMake version: Could not collect\r\nLibc version: N/A\r\n\r\nPython version: 3.9.7 (default, Sep 16 2021, 16:59:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] (64-bit runtime)\r\nPython platform: Windows-10-10.0.19043-SP0\r\nIs CUDA available: True\r\nCUDA runtime version: 11.3.58\r\nGPU models and configuration:\r\nGPU 0: NVIDIA TITAN V\r\nGPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\r\n\r\nNvidia driver version: 496.13\r\ncuDNN version: Could not collect\r\nHIP runtime version: N/A\r\nMIOpen runtime version: N/A\r\n\r\nVersions of relevant libraries:\r\n[pip3] numpy==1.21.3\r\n[pip3] torch==1.10.0+cu113\r\n[pip3] torchaudio==0.9.1\r\n[pip3] torchsummary==1.5.1\r\n[pip3] torchvision==0.11.1+cu113\r\n[conda] blas                      1.0                         mkl\r\n[conda] cpuonly                   2.0                           0    pytorch\r\n[conda] cudatoolkit               11.1.1               heb2d755_9    conda-forge\r\n[conda] mkl                       2021.3.0           haa95532_524\r\n[conda] mkl-service               2.4.0            py39h2bbff1b_0\r\n[conda] mkl_fft                   1.3.1            py39h277e83a_0\r\n[conda] mkl_random                1.2.2            py39hf11a4ad_0\r\n[conda] numpy                     1.21.3                   pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] pytorch-mutex             1.0                         cpu    pytorch\r\n[conda] torch                     1.10.0+cu113             pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] torchaudio                0.9.1                      py39    pytorch\r\n[conda] torchsummary              1.5.1                    pypi_0    pypi\r\n[conda] torchvision               0.11.1+cu113             pypi_0    pypi\r\n\r\ncc @peterjc123 @mszhanyi @skyline75489 @nbcsm @VitalyFedyunin @SsnL @ejguan @NivekT @mruberry","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/issues/69611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/issues/69611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
