Yes, the darknet training is working better for you. The biggest problem I see with the ultralytics results are that the classification loss is about 10X larger compared to the GIoU and Objectness losses. The 3 should all be roughly in balance, so you probably want to reduce your `hyp['cls']` by up to 5X or 10X to bring it in line:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/2624d55623c9b1f8af5ff1e65af6311b7a0b2615/train.py#L26\r\n\r\nThis is probably because the hyperparameters are tuned to an 80-class dataset, and you have a 2 class dataset. This is very interesting, maybe there's a way to automate this balancing in the future, perhaps using the mean losses after the first x epochs to adjust the hyps.\r\n\r\nI would also cut the training time here down by half, as it looks like after 100 epochs you've already reached a steady state solution. Can you retrain with those two changes and see if it helps?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/590114979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3063703573,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2MzcwMzU3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3063703573","actor":{"login":"BBuf","id":35585791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTg1Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35585791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf","html_url":"https://github.com/BBuf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-23T20:55:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3063703574,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjM3MDM1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3063703574","actor":{"login":"BBuf","id":35585791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTg1Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35585791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf","html_url":"https://github.com/BBuf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-23T20:55:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/590115302","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/864#issuecomment-590115302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/864","id":590115302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDExNTMwMg==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T20:58:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T20:59:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@BBuf

yes, the losses are much better balanced now. You should reduce cls by half again to about 2.5, and depending on your dataset, you may also want to train with `--multi`, which turns on multi-scale training. This is how we train COCO, and I think darknet has it on by default as well.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is you are training too long. As you can see, all of your results are already done by  epoch 100, so you should use `--epochs 100`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --epochs 100 --multi ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne last thing you could try is to apply a cosine LR scheduler, which shows improvement in COCO training.

I also use GIOU Loss in the AlexeyAB code, and all use the default parameters in your project. In addition, I use YOLOV3-Tiny network.
