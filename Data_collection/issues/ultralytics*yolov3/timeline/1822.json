Hello @HonestyBrave, thank you for your interest in YOLOv3 🚀! Please visit our ⭐️ [Tutorials](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki#tutorials) to get started, where you can find quickstart guides for simple tasks like [Custom Data Training](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) all the way to advanced concepts like [Hyperparameter Evolution](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/607).\n\nIf this is a 🐛 Bug Report, please provide screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**, otherwise we can not help you.\n\nIf this is a custom training ❓ Question, please provide as much information as possible, including dataset images, training logs, screenshots, and a public link to online [W&B logging](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data#visualize) if available.\n\nFor business inquiries or professional support requests please visit https://www.ultralytics.com or email Glenn Jocher at glenn.jocher@ultralytics.com.\n\n## Requirements\n\nPython 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, including `torch>=1.7`. To install run:\n```bash\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Environments\n\nYOLOv3 may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments (with all dependencies including [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda)/[CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):\n\n- **Google Colab and Kaggle** notebooks with free GPU: <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov3\"><img src=\"https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg\" alt=\"Open In Kaggle\"></a>\n- **Google Cloud** Deep Learning VM. See [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart)\n- **Amazon** Deep Learning AMI. See [AWS Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/AWS-Quickstart)\n- **Docker Image**. See [Docker Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Docker-Quickstart) <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/yolov3?logo=docker\" alt=\"Docker Pulls\"></a>\n\n\n## Status\n\n![CI CPU testing](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/workflows/CI%20CPU%20testing/badge.svg)\n\nIf this badge is green, all [YOLOv3 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/actions) Continuous Integration (CI) tests are currently passing. CI tests verify correct operation of YOLOv3 training ([train.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/train.py)), testing ([test.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/test.py)), inference ([detect.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/detect.py)) and export ([export.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/models/export.py)) on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu every 24 hours and on every

yolov3.yaml\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/912092289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5250246582,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCLZQgM460WKGzwAAAAE48Ge2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5250246582","actor":{"login":"HonestyBrave","id":16200506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjAwNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16200506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave","html_url":"https://github.com/HonestyBrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-02T22:06:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5250246585,"node_id":"SE_lADOCLZQgM460WKGzwAAAAE48Ge5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5250246585","actor":{"login":"HonestyBrave","id":16200506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjAwNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16200506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave","html_url":"https://github.com/HonestyBrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HonestyBrave/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-02T22:06:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/932837093","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1822#issuecomment-932837093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1822","id":932837093,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM43mfbl","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g
