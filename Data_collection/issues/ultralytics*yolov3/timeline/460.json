the Focal Loss paper section 3.3 detailed above contains good information on the topic. Basically the logits input to the objectness neurons should be highly negative on initialization, i.e. -5 to -10, since most neurons with not detect anything in a given picture. PyTorch default bias initialization is centered about zero, so the `--prebias` argument in train.py freezes the entire network, and aggressively trains these biases for one epoch before starting training. It improves performance in the first few epochs, though the long term benefit is unclear (i.e. after 100 epochs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/529246236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2617022427,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNzAyMjQyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2617022427","actor":{"login":"ZhxJia","id":45201868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjAxODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45201868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhxJia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-08T22:09:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2617022428,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTcwMjI0Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2617022428","actor":{"login":"ZhxJia","id":45201868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjAxODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45201868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhxJia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhxJia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-08T22:09:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/559920372","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/460#issuecomment-559920372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/460","id":559920372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTkyMDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"lyrgwlr","id":25834598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODM0NTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25834598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr","html_url":"https://github.com/lyrgwlr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyrgwlr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T07:27:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T21:14:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher

\r\nYou're right. I have an other doubt.\r\nI have a dataset with 2 classes. I have tryed two ways: \r\n1. change the filters before yolo layer from 255 to 21(3*(2+5)), and use \"darknet53.conv.74.weights\" as my initial weights (In this case I can't use \"yolov3-spp.weights\" casue last 3 conv weights are not match.)\r\n2. no change for .cfg, just create my own .data and change 0&1 rows in coco.names to my class name. And I use \"yolov3-spp.weights\" as my initial weights.\r\n\r\nThe hyperparameters and other things are totally same.\r\n\r\nI found the performance of the second method is better much than the first method (mAP about 5%).\r\nIs the result present:\r\n1. \"yolov3-spp.weights\" is better than \"darknet53.conv.74.weights\" in detection mission?\r\n2. the default hyperparameters is proper just for

We set the initial and final LRs as hyperparameters `hyp['lr0']` and `hyp['lrf']`, where the final LR `= lr0 * (10 ** lrf)` . For example, if the initial LR is 0.001 and the final LR is 100 times (1e-2) smaller, `hyp['lrf']=0.001` and `hyp['lrf']=-2`. This plot shows two of the available PyTorch LR schedulers, with the MultiStepLR scheduler following the original darknet implementation (at `batch_size=64` on COCO).
