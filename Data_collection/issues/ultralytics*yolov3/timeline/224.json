One more question, if I have three models as app bundle, when I open app, Does all 3 models must be loaded in Hot Memory(RAM)? If it is, then it cost a lot and also cost three times power than just loading one model.\r\nStorage space is not my concerned.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/484709212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andi00123456","id":36222693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjIyNjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36222693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456","html_url":"https://github.com/andi00123456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi00123456/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2287060896,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4NzA2MDg5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2287060896","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-18T22:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2287060898,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODcwNjA4OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2287060898","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-18T22:23:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/484709655","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/224#issuecomment-484709655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/224","id":484709655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDcwOTY1NQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-0
