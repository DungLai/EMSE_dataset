@glenn-jocher thank you very much. I had overlooked the update of the instructions. However, one question that still occurs to me. When I output my batches, it looks like I have no negative samples in either a training nor a test batch. My negative and positive samples are stored in my training.txt file as paths to the images, the negative samples do not get a .txt annotation. When I load the data sets, I can see that data sets are loaded without annotation (empty tensors). However, I do not get any negative samples in my training batch. \r\n\r\nCould this be due to the sampler? I had previously used a RandomWeightedSampler, but now I use the InfiniteSampler. Do you have any idea how I could solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThank you very much!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/781207289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JaninaMattes","id":30773447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzczNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30773447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes","html_url":"https://github.com/JaninaMattes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaninaMattes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4345688347,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM0NTY4ODM0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4345688347","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-18T09:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4345688352,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzNDU2ODgzNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4345688352","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-18T09:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/781558978","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1686#issuecomment-781558978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1686","id":781558978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTU1ODk3OA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-18T18
