See [#310 (comment)](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310#issuecomment-549629973)\r\n\r\nsure, you get better result than darknet yolo3. it is so cool. but you set a lot of parameters. eg, cls pos weight,  obj pos weight, cls obj giou loss scale factor... these parameters are all for a suitable loss, but i think it is hard to set a good value for these parameters in others dataset. The easiest is the most elegant. I believe it's more important to generalize to other data sets than to get better results on coco.Thank you again for your work.
