Thanks for asking about **handling inference results**. YOLOv5 🚀 [PyTorch Hub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) models allow for simple model loading and inference in a pure python environment without using `detect.py`. \r\n\r\nThese models are not intended for training though and do not have gradients enabled. Usage of them in this manner may require customization and is outside the scope of our support.\r\n\r\n### Simple Inference Example\r\n\r\nThis example loads a pretrained YOLOv5s model from PyTorch Hub as `model` and passes an image for inference. `'yolov5s'` is the YOLOv5 'small' model. For details on all available models please see the [README](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints). Custom models can also be loaded, including custom trained PyTorch models and their [exported](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/251) variants, i.e. ONNX, TensorRT, TensorFlow, OpenVINO YOLOv5 models.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# Model\r\nmodel = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # yolov5n - yolov5x6 official model\r\n#                                            'custom', 'path/to/best.pt')  # custom model\r\n\r\n# Images\r\nim = 'https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg'  # or file, Path, URL, PIL, OpenCV, numpy, list\r\n\r\n# Inference\r\nresults = model(im)\r\n\r\n# Results\r\nresults.print()  # or .show(), .save(), .crop(), .pandas(), etc.\r\nresults.xyxy[0]  # im predictions (tensor)\r\n\r\nresults.pandas().xyxy[0]  # im predictions (pandas)\r\n#      xmin    ymin    xmax   ymax  confidence  class    name\r\n# 0  749.50   43.50  1148.0  704.5    0.874023      0  person\r\n# 2  114.75  195.75  1095.0  708.0    0.624512      0  person\r\n# 3  986.00  304.00  1028.0  420.0    0.286865     27     tie\r\n\r\nresults.pandas().xyxy[0].value_counts('name')  # class counts (pandas)\r\n# person    2\r\n# tie       1\r\n```\r\n<img
