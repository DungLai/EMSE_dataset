thanks for the great repo with valuable commented code + support.\r\nI'd like to train a network that matches the aspect ratio of a 1080p resolution. Let's say 1056x608 resolution is close to 1080p aspect ratio. I want to train a network from scratch with that resolution. I have a few questions around that:\r\n1) Does this repo support training with network sizes that are not square? (Rectangular network size?)\r\n2) If so, what is img_size in the code? Is it always a square image fed to the network in the inference step?\r\n3) Is so called \"rectangular training\" support coming in v7 related to training non-square network sizes, or is it just an optimization around rectangular images in dataset during training?\r\n4) If I change number of filters of convolutional layers in cfg file, will this repo correctly initialize weights? It looks like it always initializes with darknet's already trained weights

@glenn-jocher, \r\n\r\nI'm trying rectangular training with `rect=True` but the tensors during training are all square starting with the input `torch.Size([16, 3, 416, 416])`, what could be the problem? \r\n\r\nI'd expect the shapes to be the nearest multiples of 32 for both image dimensions. \r\n\r\nWhat should be  `img_size`  in the line: \r\n`self.batch_shapes = np.ceil(np.array(shapes) * img_size / 32.).astype(np.int) * 32`\r\n\r\n\r\nI also noticed that images look rectangular in the `test_batch.jpg` but square in `train_batch.jpg`, does this mean that rectangular training is unsupported?
