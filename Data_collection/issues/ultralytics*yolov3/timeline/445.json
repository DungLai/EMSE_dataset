I copied yolov3-spp-pan-scale.cfg recently from AlexyAB/darknet. It didn't work out of the box, as the reorg layer doesn't exist in PyTorch, so I added a bit of custom functionality to handle these layers correctly. I have not had a chance to test it though.\r\n\r\nThe current state of affairs on the repo is that we are almost at darknet mAP when training from scratch/no backbone (see https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310). Our yolov3-320 model (regular yolov3, not spp) trains to 50.5 mAP vs 51.5 mAP reported on darknet (vs 51.8 mAP testing the darknet weights on this repo). The largest leaps in performance in recent times came from hyperparameter tuning.\r\n\r\nI have adopted a 10% training metric for all my recent tests, which train to 27 (of 273) epochs at 320 resolution. The most recent experiments are in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/441. The only significant improvement thus far is replacing `nn.LeakyReLU(0.1, inplace=True)` with Swish. Note that these tests start from the darknet53.conv.74 backbone, which is from an imagenet training using LeakyReLU 0.1. It might be more useful to repeat them from scratch (no backbone), to get a better comparison. The runs take about 10 min per epoch on a V100, so ~5 hours each.\r\n\r\nIs pan supposed to improve image detection also, or mainly video detection (is video primarily improved by the lstm change)?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/520400599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2549987188,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU0OTk4NzE4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2549987188","actor":{"login":"LukeAI","id":43993778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTkzNzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43993778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI","html_url":"https://github.com/LukeAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T12:15:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2549987190,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NDk5ODcxOTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2549987190","actor":{"login":"LukeAI","id":43993778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTkzNzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43993778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI","html_url":"https://github.com/LukeAI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeAI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-12T12:15:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/520402971","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/445#issuecomment-520402971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/445","id":520402971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQwMjk3MQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T12:24:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T12:24:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm

For example hairdryer and toaster are 0 AP items in my default 27 epoch tests. If I could add a few hundred (or a few thousand) hairdryers and toasters to the coco2014 training set we are using I'm pretty sure this would boost the mAP, though I don't know if this would really be advancing things much since it wouldn't come with any architecture/training
