hi, yes you are correct, the lowest latency way to do this is to create separate threads for inference and dataloading.\r\n\r\nThis way the model resides at all times in GPU RAM, the main process thread is always on and listening, and the dataloader threads (one for each source), are constantly observing their source and sending images to the inference queue as they appear.\r\n\r\nThis type of on-demand inference system is suitable for low latency server response or for always on security camera feeds for example. Additional logic would omit similar images or video frames very close in time to save energy.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of these benefits though are above and beyond what the baseline repo should necessarily offer, and of course will introduce much additional code, and make the code less extensible for third party applications as it will have become more targeted to specific applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/589322980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3058260690,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA1ODI2MDY5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3058260690","actor":{"login":"RulerOf","id":539074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTA3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/539074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf","html_url":"https://github.com/RulerOf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-20T21:18:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3058260691,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNTgyNjA2OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3058260691","actor":{"login":"RulerOf","id":539074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTA3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/539074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf","html_url":"https://github.com/RulerOf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RulerOf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-20T21:18:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
