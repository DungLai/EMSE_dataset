These values are normalizing constants used when the loss reduction is set to `sum` rather than `mean`. red == `sum` means that the losses are summed over the 3 output layers before a normalizing constants are applied (assigning greater loss to the output layers with the most anchors). red == `mean` means that the losses are meaned at each of the 3 output layers before being summed togethor (assigning equal loss to each output layer). 3 is used because it is the number of yolo output layers. 6300 is the number of anchors at `--img-size 320`, and 2 is a simple fudge factor to bring the `sum` objectness loss closer in magnitude to the `mean` obj loss. Note these are all very experimental at the moment.\r\n\r\n2. These are hyperparameters which are evolved using a genetic algorithm.
