If you're compiling Apex against a pip or conda installed torch binary (which are compiled by upstream with -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0), Pytorch's extension builder should detect this, and set -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 for the Apex extension build as well.  \r\n2.  If you're compiling Apex against a version of Pytorch that you installed from source, Pytorch's extension builder does NOT attempt to set -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=anything.  Rather, it assumes that the environment (including the current value of -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI) in which you're currently compiling Apex extensions is the same as it was when you compiled Pytorch on your system, in which case the value of that variable used while compiling Apex will match the value that was used while compiling Pytorch.\r\n\r\nIn both case 1 and case 2, the upshot is that compiling extensions should \"just work\" without having to worry about -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 or 1.

It seems the solution to make apex work with cpp extension in Arch Linux is by building pytorch with the proper -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI flag yourself (see [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-apex-git/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-apex-git/)). I also tried with a conda installation of pytorch and it doesn't work neither.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/484381736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"drapado","id":45577687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTc3Njg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45577687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado","html_url":"https://github.com/drapado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drapado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2284785439,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4NDc4NTQzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2284785439","actor":{"login":"mcarilli","id":7799218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTkyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7799218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli","html_url":"https://github.com/mcarilli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-18T07:04:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2284785440,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODQ3ODU0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2284785440","actor":{"login":"mcarilli","id":7799218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTkyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7799218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli","html_url":"https://github.com/mcarilli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcarilli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-18T07:04:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T11:11:12Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T11:11:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/269/eve
