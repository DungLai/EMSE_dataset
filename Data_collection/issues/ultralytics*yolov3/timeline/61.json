(1) from paper, there is an ignore threshold to bypass loss calculation, but I don't see such implementation in your code. In the paper, it says: \"If the bounding box prior is not the best but does overlap a ground truth object by more than some threshold we ignore the prediction\".\r\n\r\nYes this is correct. To properly implement this though deeper structural changes are needed to process all 3 YOLO layers simultaneously to select the best single anchor out of the 9 available (now the best of 3 is the selected at each of the 3 YOLO layers, each YOLO loss layer operates independently, and an arbitrary threshold of 0.1 IOU is used to reject inappropriate anchors). See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9#issuecomment-447530390\r\n\r\n> (2) You seems to calculate square error loss of \"torch.sigmoid(tx,ty)\" rather than tx, ty as it should be. \r\n\r\nYes. This is a simple change to make. Are you sure the MSE loss should be about the raw tx and ty? I tried a few batches this way and this does make the x,y losses much more similar in magnitude to the w,h...\r\n\r\n> (3) for class prediction, the paper says: \"We do not use a softmax as we have found it is unnecessary for good performance, instead we simply use independent logistic classiﬁers\", so you might first \"torch.sigmoid(cls_pred)\" and then use BCELoss function.\r\n\r\nYes, both `CrossEntropyLoss` and `BCEWithLogitLoss` accept logit inputs, while `BCEWithLogitLoss` is the same as `BCELoss(torch.sigmoid(x),...)`. I tried using BCE rather than CE for the class confidences, but the result was far worse. You can try this yourself and see the result of the change after just one epoch. The balancing constants also surely require changing as the loss magnitudes output by the two methods (CE and BCE) are greatly different.\r\n\r\n> (4) for objectness prediction, you might also use sigmoid function first, and bypass the calculation of those in the ignore group as (1) mentioned. (simply set loss = 0)\r\n\r\nYes this is how the ignore group should work, it would not be in `mask` and thus not involved in the loss at all. To properly implement this deep structural changes are needed that process all 3 YOLO layers simultaneously to select the best single anchor out of the 9 available (now the best of 3 is the selected at each of the 3 YOLO layers).

I'm actually working on implementing this. If I understand it correctly, all 3 YOLO layers should point to the same object, and all 9 anchors should be computed every time. Loss is only generated if the best boxes were matched to the current \"scale\" (out of the 3 scales). The model cfg-files contain a threshold of 0.5 (it was later changed to 0.7 but I still use 0.5 for training in Darknet code). \r\n\r\nAlso\r\n> and an arbitrary threshold of 0.1 IOU is used to reject inappropriate anchors)\r\n\r\nSo if I understand you (@glenn-jocher) correctly the 0.1 threshold exists to somewhat tackle the fact that loss is generated from all 3 scales rather than the best one? So resolving this issue should also rid of the 0.1 threshold. \r\n\r\n2. I'm actually not 100% sure which one is right there.\r\n\r\n3. As mentioned, CE seems to work the same. Mathematically there shouldn't be a difference between CE and BCE when there are only two classes, unless I'm missing something?\r\nAlso, as a general rule of thumb it's usually better to use the `LossWithLogits` (regardless of loss function being used) for numerical stability. It avoids consecutive logs-and-exps (or vice-versa).\r\n\r\n4. Again not 100% sure what you meant here. Would appreciate clarifications :-)\r\n\r\n5. From the paper (your comments made me go and take another look at it, it's been a while since I read it):\r\n\r\n> If a bounding box prior is not assigned to a ground truth object it incurs no loss for coordinate or class predictions, only objectness.\r\n\r\nI'm either missing this in the implementation or this doesn't take
