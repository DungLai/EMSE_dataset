This might be driver related, in which case using the Docker image for your training should fix, or it's also possible that the training time is dominated by a completely separate factor, like loading times from the hard drive or something else. \r\n\r\nThe single image inference might not be a good measurement of the inference time, as sometimes CUDA devices require warmup operations depending on cuda/cudnn settings. You might want to run this several times first, or place 10-20 images in a directory for inference and then compare times for the last few images. When we benchmark times for official models we use the average across the 5000 COCO val set images by running test.py.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/784016950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4363951337,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDM2Mzk1MTMzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4363951337","actor":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-23T08:59:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4363951344,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQzNjM5NTEzNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4363951344","actor":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-23T08:59:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/784030768","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1691#issuecomment-784030768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1691","id":784030768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDAzMDc2OA==","user":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T09:24:27Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T10:03:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher
