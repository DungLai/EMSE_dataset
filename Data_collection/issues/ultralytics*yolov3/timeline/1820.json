reason why I asked questions about broadcast dataset is that I find your repo and pytorch-image-models broadcast or not broadcast differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/903737532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5194250990,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE5NDI1MDk5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5194250990","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T12:53:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5194250997,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxOTQyNTA5OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/5194250997","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T12:53:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/905297748","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1820#issuecomment-905297748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1820","id":905297748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCLZQgM419b9U","user":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-25T08:32:46Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T08:33:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher

so this issue should be resolved there now, and these updates will be backpropagated to YOLOv3 eventually.\r\n\r\nOne question I had for you along the DDP topic is my new YOLOv5 EarlyStopping PR https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/4576. It works well for Single-GPU, but in DDP mode the `stop` variable is not broadcast correctly to all ranks, and training hangs rather than ending.
