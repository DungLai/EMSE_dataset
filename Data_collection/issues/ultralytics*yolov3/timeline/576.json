know yolov3 is an object detector. I don’t think my question was clear enough then. Currently you transfer the weights of a darknet53 classifier to the backbone of Yolov3. To train the remaining layers you still need a lot of labelled data containing bounding boxes. That is very time consuming to do. What I want to do is have simpler labels. What I thought was find a way to transfer the weights of a second classifier, one that is trained to classify custom objects and fine tune the remaining parts of yolov3 using much, much less bounding box labelled data. Does that make sense? I’m not looking for a classifier as an end product, but a custom object detector. I just want to find a better way to train yolov3 for custom objects without having to label 10000 bounding boxes ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/548581578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pfeatherstone","id":45853521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODUzNTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45853521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone","html_url":"https://github.com/pfeatherstone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/548582552","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/576#issuecomment-548582552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/576","id":548582552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODU4MjU1Mg==","user":{"login":"pfeatherstone","id":45853521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODUzNTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45853521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone","html_url":"https://github.com/pfeatherstone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfeatherstone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T21:47:35Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T21:47:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently we use a darknet53 classifier trained on imagenet as a frozen backbone and train the remaining layers.

complicado.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/615911737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3248197640,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI0ODE5NzY0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3248197640","actor":{"login":"FranciscoReveriano","id":48685139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njg1MTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48685139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano","html_url":"https://github.com/FranciscoReveriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18T17:49:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3248197643,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNDgxOTc2NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3248197643","actor":{"login":"FranciscoReveriano","id":48685139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njg1MTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48685139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano","html_url":"https://github.com/FranciscoReveriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18T17:49:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/615912431","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/576#issuecomment-615912431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/576","id":615912431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTkxMjQzMQ==","user":{"login":"FranciscoReveriano","id":48685139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njg1MTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48685139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano","html_url":"https://github.com/FranciscoReveriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/repos","events_u
