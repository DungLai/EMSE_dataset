ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Thanks for asking about **CUDA memory issues**. YOLOv5 ðŸš€ can be trained on CPU, [single-GPU](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data), or [multi-GPU](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/475). When training on GPU it is important to keep your batch-size small enough that you do not use all of your GPU memory, otherwise you will see a CUDA Out Of Memory (OOM) Error and your training will crash. You can observe your CUDA memory utilization using either the `nvidia-smi` command or by viewing your console output:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-28 at 12 19 51\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/131122318-8141d1ce-13de-44bf-bbdc-487bad442ff0.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a CUDA OOM error, the steps you can take to reduce your memory usage are:\r\n\r\n- Reduce `--batch-size`\r\n- Reduce `--img-size`\r\n- Reduce model size, i.e. from YOLOv5x -> YOLOv5l -> YOLOv5m -> YOLOv5s\r\n- Train with [multi-GPU](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/475) at the same `--batch-size`\r\n- Upgrade your hardware to a larger GPU\r\n- Train on free GPU backends with up to 16GB of CUDA memory: <a
