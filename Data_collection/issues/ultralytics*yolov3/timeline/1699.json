1.69 | 0.73 | 0.617 |  \r\n\r\nI have 2 doubts:\r\n1) the training speed of num_workers=2 is quite faster than that of num_workers=1, however, there small difference for num_workers=2 and 4.\r\n2) when num_workers=2, there are much CPU ram and GPU ram left, num_workers=8 doesn't work. it is very weird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/791928619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4416832154,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQxNjgzMjE1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4416832154","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-06T12:25:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4416832156,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0MTY4MzIxNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4416832156","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-06T12:25:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/791991869","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1699#issuecomment-791991869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1699","id":791991869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTk5MTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-06T17:13:21Z","updated_at":"2021-03-06T17:13:2
