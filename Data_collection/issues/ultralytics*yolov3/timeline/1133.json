 many thanks.\r\nTo justify (sorry),  the order of metrics ? , prec, rec, map, f1, val/giou loss, val/obj loss and val/cls loss.. If so, I updated hyps in train.py, but I did not got higher results, got  map 0.86 with 0.06 increase, P: 0.96, R:0.68 AND F1: 0.80. According to these hyps, I had to get (0.96 0.833 0.911 0.892 1.47 0.247 0) that map is 0.91... ? Am I right ? (It looks like only F1 is same compared to evolve params). \r\nAnother quesiton, I wonder what do you suggest for my medical data (700 images and 200 for test) with single class ?\r\nDo I need to do augmententation before training or train.py is enough ? I am waiting for your suggest ? ( yolo.weights and yolov3.cfg worked best for me). \r\nMany thanks again.
