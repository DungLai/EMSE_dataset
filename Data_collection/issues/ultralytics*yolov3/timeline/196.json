the speedup from transfer learning is not very significant for this repo, or any large object detection network in general. It is much more applicable to smaller ML tasks. Here with YOLOv3 we can assume roughly:\r\n\r\n- 1/3 of the time is spent loading and augmenting the data\r\n- 1/3 of the time spent on the forward pass through the network\r\n- 1/3 spent computing the gradient and applying the optimizer\r\n\r\nTransfer learning is only reducing some of the 3rd step.

results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/480789118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2259327925,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI1OTMyNzkyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2259327925","actor":{"login":"Ownmarc","id":24617457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE3NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24617457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc","html_url":"https://github.com/Ownmarc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-08T11:13:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2259327927,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNTkzMjc5Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2259327927","actor":{"login":"Ownmarc","id":24617457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE3NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24617457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc","html_url":"https://github.com/Ownmarc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-08T11:13:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/480793004","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/196#issuecomment-480793004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/196","id":480793004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDc5MzAwNA==","user":{"login":"Mysorrows","id":29940894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTQwODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29940894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows","html_url":"https://github.com/Mysorrows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mysorrows/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T11:27:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T11:27:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"My
