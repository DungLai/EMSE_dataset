I get it.\r\nI used darkent to train my own dataset and probably got 0.5@mAP=52.7. Using your code, without changing the hidden parameters, the best result I got is about 51 (fine-tuning 100 epoch with pre -trained darknet model). Now I want to search for hidden parameters with --epoch 10 --evolve for 200 times, which takes about ten days, which is crazy. I think I can get better results than the original darkent  by manually adjusting the parameters, can you give me some suggestions, in other words, which hidden parameters are more important and should be considered.
