I've commented to various people in various issues the following, I should really raise a dedicated issue to this topic and shut down the rest as duplicates. I'll do this today and point you to it, but in short we have not been able to train full coco to 273 epochs (as darknet does) due to time and GPU constraints. The loss constants are tuned to those values (4, 8, 1, 64 etc) because hyperparameter searches produced better results at those settings compared to default darknet loss constants of 1.0 across the board. CE is also swapped for BCE is the cls loss because it produced better results, and lastly there is a 0.10 IOU rejection during training in utils.py, another hyperameter we set. I will elaborate on all of these in a seperate post and link you to it in a few hours.\r\n\r\nLike I told @Kev1nZheng I strongly suggest you play around with the tutorial datasets first (i.e. coco_100img.data, coco_1000img.data) before committing yourself to full coco training.

can you post your results.png image? Your results look pretty good. My main worry is the training increases flattening out past epoch 50. Generally aggressive results at the beginning of training come at the expense of the final trained model. A more gradual training will not produce the best results early on, but in general does produce better results later on, if you are patient enough to wait. It really depends on the application and the user's priorities. I would say this repository is currently tuned aggressively to create the best initial response (i.e. in the first 30 epochs) at an unknown cost later on.\r\n\r\nThe command to plot your results is

ah, your results look good. Beware though the LR scheduler reduces LR at epochs 218, 245, i.e. batches 400k, 450k in darknet (from 1e-3 to 1e-4, 1e-5), so training past 273 will not change anything since the LR is barely nonzero. In your case it seems the best test loss was achieved right after the first drop, at epoch 218. \r\n\r\nLike I told @ahmedtalbi, there are a variety of hyperparameters you could try tuning, such as the loss constants, the loss criteria, the LR, LR schedule, image augmentation, IOU rejection constant in build_targets(), etc. We've set the current ones based on previous searches, but they could use more tuning. The reason we started the searches was because the default darknet loss function was not performing well in pytorch unfortunately. I will be starting a dedicated issue to track these hyperparameters soon hopefully.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/482183166/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2269786368,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI2OTc4NjM2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2269786368","actor":{"login":"ahmedtalbi","id":7291728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7291728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedtalbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-11T16:20:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2269786370,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNjk3ODYzNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2269786370","actor":{"login":"ahmedtalbi","id":7291728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7291728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedtalbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-11T16:20:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2269786371,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI2OTc4NjM3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2269786371","actor":{"login":"Kev1nZheng","id":24239053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjM5MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24239053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/Kev1nZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kev1nZheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-11T16:20:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2269786373,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNjk3ODYzNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yol
