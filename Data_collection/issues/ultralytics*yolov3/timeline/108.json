\r\nyou're right, maybe the origin paper trained the weights with anchor non-scale although the input image size changed. \r\nIn another repo [yolov3](https://github.com/xuzheyuan624/yolov3-pytorch) which has a standard evaluation func, It uses the COCOAPI to eval the mAP. When I use it to eval the official-yolov3.weights with 608 image size, got 0.567mAP(iou0.5), but after I add anchor scale code to eval, I got a 0.05mAP, It's bad. I guess this is because the official-yolov3.weights was trained without anchor non-scale code, so when I add anchor scale code to the eval func, it leads to the w, h detection boxes is 608/416 times the origin, which lead to iou between label and detection boxes lower than 0.5.  -  -
