I have a very small dataset of satellite imagery with two classes of farms:  let's say I have 200 total farms, with 13 swine, and 167 poultry.  When I run the ultralytics code, I get great training results in terms of MAP data, but poor results on test data, simply because I have so few images.  Hence, I am thinking I should augment outside the ultralytics code to get more data - and this made me wonder what is the data augmentation within the ultralytics code actually doing? \r\nFor my case, with really small image sets, is it really helpful just to transform the image (rather than actually add to them)?
