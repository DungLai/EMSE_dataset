When outputting a video stream from a webcam, I get a huge number of bounding box for one object, which accumulate over several frames, then are reset and accumulate again.\r\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS\r\n\r\nI observe this kind of network behavior when using a webcam. Also, this behavior is observed when using the command you proposed for verification:\r\n> `python3 detect.py --source

Thank you very much for your quick and clear answer!\r\nYes, I understand what you are talking about. Also, your words about output on old frames have some meaning for me. Moreover, each new bounding box appears inside the old one, which indicates that the detector receives not the previous frame, but its modified version, on which the bounding box is already drawn using cv2.\r\nThe function plot_one_box changes the image itself, not its copy. Therefore, if we pass this function not the image itself, but a copy of it, and draw this copy, then the original will not be changed.\r\nIndeed, if I change part of the code:\r\n```\r\n            if webcam:  # batch_size >= 1\r\n                p, s, im0 = path[i], '%g: ' % i, im0s[0]\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n            if webcam:  # batch_size >= 1\r\n                p, s, im0 = path[i], '%g: ' % i, im0s[0].copy()\r\n```\r\nI get output as expected using the LoadStreams class and threads. This solves the output problem for me. Perhaps this will be useful for the project or people who are facing the same problem as me.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that threads are not an absolutely good solution in all cases. I also notice that the LoadWebcam class works much better on my webcam, and the LoadStreams class works better on the HTTP stream. With what it can be connected? And wouldn’t it be the best option to suggest the user to choose a method of loading a video stream?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/637986800/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"droogg","id":38979060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTc5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38979060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg","html_url":"https://github.com/droogg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droogg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3400625473,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQwMDYyNTQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3400625473","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-03T06:33:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
