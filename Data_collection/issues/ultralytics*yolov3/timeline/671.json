By default, the program will call the spp.weights file if you try using \"--weights\". You should make sure that your .cfg file is configured for that weights. Or you should be more specific and call weights/yolov3.weights \r\nThe only other possible reason is that you didn't properly change the filters in the last convolutional layer. The layer right before each Yolo layer should be changed. \r\nPlease let us know if neither of these two things helps.
