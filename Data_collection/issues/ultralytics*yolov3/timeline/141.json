Not much to do about things there unless you were to decompress all the jpegs (which might be a good idea if you plan to do lots of training). `np.loadtxt()` might also be replaced some faster code as well.

more information see issue https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/21.\r\n\r\nWe started a multi_gpu branch (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/tree/multi_gpu), with a secondary goal of trying out a different loss approach, selecting a single anchor from the 9 available for each target. The new loss  produced significantly worse results, so it appears the current method of selecting one anchor from each yolo layer is correct. In the process we did get multi_gpu operational, though not with the speedups expected. We did not attempt to use a multithreaded PyTorch dataloader, nor PIL in place of OpenCV, as we found both of these slower in our single-GPU profiling last year.\r\n\r\nWe don't have multiple gpu machines on premise so we tested this with GCP Deep Learning VMs. We used `batch_size=26` (max that 1 P100 can handle) times the number of GPUs. All other training setting were defaults. We selected the fastest batch out of the first 30 for timing purposes. Results are below for our branch  and the https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/pull/121 PR. In both cases the speedups were very poor. It's possible the IO ops were constrained by GCP due to the limited SSD size, we will try again with a larger SSD but we wanted to get these results out here for feedback.

trainer works with dataparallel. I haven't updated the test.py code yet, but it should be straightforward. I added a new dataset class to implement a standard pytorch dataset class, so I can feed it into a torch.utils.data.DataLoader, to get the benefits of threading. Shuffling is still handled by the dataset class, hence the batch size of 1 and shuffle=False in the dataloader.\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to hear your comments and thanks for your work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/475784653","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/141#issuecomment-475784653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/141","id":475784653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTc4NDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"ydixon","id":22487836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg3ODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22487836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon","html_url":"https://github.com/ydixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T21:11:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T21:11:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher I haven't look into details from the update. I just wanted to point out if you are using Dataloader from the pytorch library, the worker threads might mess up the random seeds. Let's say you have 4 worker threads, you'll might end up with the same augmentation for the 4 threads. And it's also almost impossible to get deterministic behavior (if that's a concern) without modifying the Dataloader class or simply write your own multi-processing dataloader. If all this is already considered, I guess its all good :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/475784653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ydixon","id":22487836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg3ODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22487836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon","html_url":"https://github.com/ydixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydixon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2223832837,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIyMzgzMjgzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2223832837","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-22T21:11:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2223832838,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMjM4MzI4Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2223832838","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-22T21:11:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
