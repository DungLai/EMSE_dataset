This is pretty simple. If you have xywh data just divide `x` and `w` by the width of the image, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data:\r\nEach image's label file must be locatable by simply replacing `/images/*.jpg` with `/labels/*.txt` in its pathname. For example the image and labels file for the first image in our sample dataset are:\r\n```\r\n../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000013992.jpg\r\n../coco/labels/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000013992.txt\r\n```\r\nLabels must be in `[class x_center y_center width height]` format. Coordinates must be in **normalized xywh** format (from 0 - 1). Classes are zero-indexed. **Since this example has only 1 class, all of our labels use class 0.** An example label file with 4 people:\r\n<img width=\"474\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-02-20 at 17 05 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/53105599-ba7dff80-3531-11e9-8860-10a48872b043.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/480497790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2257413459,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI1NzQxMzQ1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2257413459","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-06T11:49:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
