We are still trying to determine the correct loss function and optimal hyperparameters for training in pytorch. There are a few issues open on this, such as https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/205 and https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/12. A couple things of note:\r\n\r\n- The plotted mAPs are at 0.1 conf_thres (for speed during training). If you run test.py directly it will run mAP at 0.001 conf_thres,  which will produce a higher mAP. \r\n- Your LR scheduler may or may not have applied here, depending on how you set your number of epochs argument in the argparser `--epochs`.\r\n- Darknet training uses multi_scale by default, with scaling from 50% to 150% of your default size.\r\n- Darknet training also involves several steps I believe, including training on other datasets and altering layers. You can read about this more in the YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 papers: https://pjreddie.com/publications/\r\n- This implementation lacks the 0.7 ignore theshold in the original darknet, which is on our TODO list but not yet implemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/497960946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2382798490,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4Mjc5ODQ5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2382798490","actor":{"login":"Aurora33","id":43119691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTE5Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43119691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33","html_url":"https://github.com/Aurora33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T16:59:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2382798491,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODI3OTg0OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2382798491","actor":{"login":"Aurora33","id":43119691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTE5Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43119691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33","html_url":"https://github.com/Aurora33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aurora33/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-01T16:59:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/501148945","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310#issuecomment-501148945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310","id":501148945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTE0ODk0NQ==","user":{"login":"majuncai","id":32629717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjI5NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32629717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai","html_url":"https://github.com/majuncai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majuncai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T07:08:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T07:08:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

I see. The main things I noticed is that your LR scheduler has not taken effect, since it only kicks in at 80% and 90% of the epoch count. The mAP typically increases significantly after this. Also multi-scale training has a large effect. Lastly, we reinterpreted the darknet training settings so that we believe you only need 68 epochs for full training. \r\n\r\nAll of these changes have been applied in the last few days. I recommend you `git pull` and train from scratch to 68 epochs.

PyTorch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/501799759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2411357283,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQxMTM1NzI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2411357283","actor":{"login":"XinjieInformatik","id":20421610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDIxNjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20421610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik","html_url":"https://github.com/XinjieInformatik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-13T17:23:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2411357284,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MTEzNTcyODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2411357284","actor":{"login":"XinjieInformatik","id":20421610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDIxNjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20421610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik","html_url":"https://github.com/XinjieInformatik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinjieInformatik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-13T17:23:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/502449727","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310#issuecomment-502449727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310","id":502449727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjQ0OTcyNw==","user":{"login":"fereenwong","id":43628797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjI4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43628797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong","html_url":"https://github.com/fereenwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fereenwong/recei

cher Just finished an experiment training on the full COCO dataset from scratch, using the default hyperparameter values. My model was YOLOv3-320, and I trained to 200 epochs with multi-scale training on and rectangular training off. After running test.py, I managed to get 47.4 mAP, which unfortunately is not the 51.5 corresponding to pjreddie's experiment. \r\n\r\nI can try training again but this time to 273 epochs, although it seems that each stage before the learning rate decreased per the scheduler had already plateaued, so I don't think it would benefit much. Is there a comprehensive TODO list that you think will improve mAP? I notice you mentioned the 0.7 ignore threshold. What do you mean by this?
