I see. On second thought there seems to be no reason to write the new video with the same codec as the old video. The optimal solution would be to write the new video with H.265, but I don't think opencv supports this yet, so then H.264 would be the best option. \r\n\r\nDo you know of the best H.264 option that supports all 3 operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux?). If you can come up with a good solution and validate your code under the 3 operating systems then please submit a PR including the testing results.

you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/487544784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2306409775,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwNjQwOTc3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2306409775","actor":{"login":"dkendall100","id":43619961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE5OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43619961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100","html_url":"https://github.com/dkendall100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-29T11:30:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2306409776,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDY0MDk3NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2306409776","actor":{"login":"dkendall100","id":43619961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE5OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43619961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100","html_url":"https://github.com/dkendall100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-29T11:30:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/488164090","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/243#issuecomment-488164090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/243","id":488164090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE2NDA5MA==","user":{"login":"dkendall100","id":43619961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE5OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43619961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100","html_url":"https://github.com/dkendall100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkendall100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-01T00:42:45Z","updated_at":"2019-05-01T00:42
