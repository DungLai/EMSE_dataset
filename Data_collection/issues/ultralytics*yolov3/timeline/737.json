Testing during training operates at 0.10 conf-thres for speed, whereas maximum mAP is acheived at lower conf-thres, such as the default 0.001 when test.py is called directly. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/214\r\n\r\nThe testloader caches images at full resolution currently, whereas the train loader caches images at the minimum required image size. This may be updated in future releases, but note that image caching is only recommended for small datasets, as each dataloader worker incurs the same RAM requirements (caching happens 8X for 8 workers).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/568550474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2905415802,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkwNTQxNTgwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2905415802","actor":{"login":"wallcuber","id":58249279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ5Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58249279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber","html_url":"https://github.com/wallcuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-23T18:44:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2905415804,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MDU0MTU4MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2905415804","actor":{"login":"wallcuber","id":58249279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ5Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58249279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber","html_url":"https://github.com/wallcuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-23T18:44:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/570176565","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/737#issuecomment-570176565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/737","id":570176565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDE3NjU2NQ==","user":{"login":"wallcuber","id":58249279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ5Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58249279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber","html_url":"https://github.com/wallcuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallcuber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T11:03:09Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T11:03:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank
