There are a few 'bag of specials' attributes that are not implemented in this repo, but they have a minor effect.\r\n> \r\n> `python train.py --cfg yolov4.cfg --weights ''`\r\n\r\nHey, @glenn-jocher , do you have an idea what is the minimum of RAM necessary to train a model using the YOLOV4? I have seen the same behavior that you have spoken about the memory consumption to be about 3X higher; I have seen the same! I have tried to do the test using one server with 64GB and 2 GPUs RTX 2070 and it didn't work. Now, I'm using another one, but it just was possible to run using a batch size of 8 and with only one GPU.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to use 2 GPU, I get this error message:\r\n\r\n\r\n`Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 412, in <module>\r\n    train()  # train normally\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 174, in train\r\n    model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, find_unused_parameters=True)\r\n  File \"/home/monster/miniconda3/envs/ultralyticsv4/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/parallel/distributed.py\", line 287, in __init__\r\n    self._ddp_init_helper()\r\n  File \"/home/monster/miniconda3/envs/ultralyticsv4/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/parallel/distributed.py\", line 380, in _ddp_init_helper\r\n    expect_sparse_gradient)\r\nRuntimeError: Model replicas must have an equal number of parameters.`\r\n\r\nBoth GPU are RTX 2070.\r\n\r\nFor me, it seems a Pytorch bug...
