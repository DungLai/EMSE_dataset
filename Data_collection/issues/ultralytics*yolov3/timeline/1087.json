the COCO website:\r\n\r\n> the split is now 118K/5K for train/val. The same exact images are used, and no new annotations for detection/keypoints are provided.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the changes are expectable because most research works use the same custom splits for COCO 2014 which should become the default in COCO 2017 with 5K in val.  Otherwise, the 5K `minival` results cannot be comparable with recent detection model zoo such as `detectron2` and `mmdetection` which standardize the results based on `val2017` already.\r\n\r\nActually, [detectron repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/detectron/datasets/data/README.md#coco-minival-annotations) explicitly describes the COCO Minival Annotations as follows:\r\n\r\n> Our custom minival and valminusminival annotations are available for download here. Please note that minival is exactly equivalent to the recently defined 2017 val set. Similarly, the union of valminusminival and the 2014 train is exactly equivalent to the 2017 train set.\r\n\r\nIn short, COCO_2017_train = COCO_2014_train + `valminusminival` , COCO_2017_val = `minival`, where `valminusminival` and `minival` are from COCO 2014 val as the custom splits used in early object detection work.\r\n\r\nNow, looking into `instances_minival2014.json`, the last 5 files are listed as follows:\r\n```\r\nCOCO_val2014_000000581317.jpg\r\nCOCO_val2014_000000581357.jpg\r\nCOCO_val2014_000000581482.jpg\r\nCOCO_val2014_000000581615.jpg\r\nCOCO_val2014_000000581781.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above is the same as the last 5 files in `val2017`:\r\n```\r\n$> ls images/val2017 | sort | tail\r\n000000581317.jpg\r\n000000581357.jpg\r\n000000581482.jpg\r\n000000581615.jpg\r\n000000581781.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `5K.txt` used by YOLO for COCO 2014 lists the following:\r\n```\r\n$> sort 5k.txt | tail\r\n./coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000581655.jpg\r\n../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000581731.jpg\r\n../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000581781.jpg\r\n../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000581887.jpg\r\n../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000581899.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be surprising if YOLO does not follow the same convention. An inquiry about the splits on the darknet repo would be necessary soon. As for now, the pretrained YOLOv4 weights produces different results on the 5K from COCO 2014 and the val2017 using the `test.py` script which may cause quite a bit confusion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/634304320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"farleylai","id":158540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai","html_url":"https://github.com/farleylai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farleylai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3375584006,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM3NTU4NDAwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3375584006","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-26T22:02:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3375584009,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNzU1ODQwMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3375584009","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-26T22:02:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/634312312","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1087#issuecomment-634312312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1087","id":634312312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDMxMjMxMg==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-26T22:23:18Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T2
