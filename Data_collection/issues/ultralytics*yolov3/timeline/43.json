@Hello526 Subdivisions are similar to `iter_size` to those familiar with Caffe. It's also sometimes referred to as _virtual batch-size_ or _accumulated gradients_ in the literature.\r\nWhat this means in practice is that to emulate an effective batch size of 64 (which is the set of hard-coded hyperparameters chosen in the original paper for training) we use a subdivision of 16 - since we can only fit 64/16=4 actual images when training on a P100 (or whatever was used in the original paper implementation).\r\n\r\nOn GPUs with larger memory sizes this parameter can be reduced to 8, and for higher resolution should be 32. Implementing support for this in pytorch is quite easy. Note that this is very important, and training with batch sizes of 4 without any accumulation will probably not work as well due to noisier signals compared to using 64 images for every gradient step. \r\n\r\nAlso note that sometimes different frameworks vary slightly in terms of correct hyperparameters for optimization. I've experienced this when moving from Caffe to TF a couple of years ago and I wouldn't be surprised if this will be true for
