Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it.

> @hac135 most people don't realize this, and it's not the recommended method to go about things, but you can technically use the existing YOLOv3 architecture (and hence the pretrained `yolov3.pt`) to train any model with `n<=80` classes with no changes. The unused `conf` outputs will learn to simply default to zero, and the rest of the unused outputs (the box and class conf associated with those unused classes) will no longer matter.\r\n> > For example, our single class tutorial operates just as well with no modifications to the cfg file:\r\n> > https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Example:-Train-Single-Class\r\n> > It's not clean and its not optimal, but it works.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you ! it did works!\r\n\r\ni want to retain the existing classes and add new class i.e total of 80+1=81 class in coco dataset.Please tell me how to do it using transfer learning","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/492532519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"parul19","id":46003855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDAzODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46003855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19","html_url":"https://github.com/parul19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parul19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
