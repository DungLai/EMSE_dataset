no I don't think so. NMS would make training veryyy slow, maybe up to 10X slower. It's a CPU-only functionality since the removal of overlapping boxes occurs in series, not in parallel.\r\n\r\nOne option we have to speed up training (and reduce CPU usage) is to not compute P and R at each batch (they are not required to compute the loss). I just recently added a commit to run test.py after each epoch to get the mAP of the epoch. I can simply extract P and R from there instead. I think this might speed up training around 10%, or possibly even 20%.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 1:** I implemented this change in the latest commit. **The speed improvement on a GCP P100 instance is about 13% during training (16-image time per batch dropped from .78s to .68s)**. Note that P and R values are not reported per batch anymore, the new (more accurate) P and R values are obtained at the end of the epoch from test.py and saved in results.txt. \r\n\r\nIf you guys have local GPUs can try profiling the code to determine the slow spots? Spyder with line_profiler works very well for this. At the moment I'm only using GCP so I can't profile.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2:** I've added the `batch_report` boolean to the argparser now in train.py. `True` sets the behavior to what is was before, reporting all the statistics every batch (which slowed things down by about 15%). Default is `False`, so training should be a bit faster now, and all these operations were on CPU, so CPU usage should hopefully drop.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/154fae4430b62245497769b019f84ab91ec7b57a/train.py#L15","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/441004085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1982295164,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk4MjI5NTE2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1982295164","actor":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-22T11:40:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1982295165,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5ODIyOTUxNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1982295165","actor":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-22T11:40:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/445797677","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/35#issuecomment-445797677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/35","id":445797677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTc5NzY3Nw==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T12:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-
