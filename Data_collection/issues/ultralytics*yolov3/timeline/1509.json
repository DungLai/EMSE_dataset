We'd probably need to see your config file to help you, \r\n\r\notherwise, if I'm correct in my judgment by your .cfg filename - that you are using colour 4 channels instead of 3 - that may be partially responsible as you also are using different batch sixes (4 on the left 16 on the right) you may want to make sure the extra channel and the batch size are getting muddled. \r\n\r\nThat's the only thing I can think of since the test set would've been loaded during the fist training run\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd suggest you'd start using @glenn-jocher  's YOLOV5 I have been using it and feels easier to work with, you can also download the model directly from Pytorch hub if it makes it easier for you to work for \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/721677760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MaxwellHogan","id":31250274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjUwMjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31250274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxwellHogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxwellHogan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3957138905,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk1NzEzODkwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3957138905","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-04T11:28:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3957138912,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NTcxMzg5MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3957138912","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-04T11:28:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3957145789,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk1NzE0NTc4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3957145789","actor":{"login":"jas-nat","id":52592216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTkyMjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52592216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat","html_url":"https://github.com/jas-nat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jas-nat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-04T11:30:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3957145798,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NTcxNDU3OTg=","url":"h
