I've been training using default setting and now is in epoch 241 with the result below (Fig. 1). I have some inquires below.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Is the result you report [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map) and mAP result in Fig. 1 calculated with same metric?\r\n\r\nResult reported in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map is from pycocotools mAP (the official mAP). You get this by running `python3 test.py --save-json` as in the examples shown in that section. \r\n\r\n> 2. Continuing (1), what is the metric for the mAP? (i) 0.5 or (ii) 0.5:0.05:0.95? Because for (ii), the original paper reports ~33%.\r\n\r\n0.5\r\n\r\n> 3. Still continuing (1), what is also the metric of the R (recall)? Is it: (i) general recall: recall for all objects (instances), or (ii) ARmax=1/10/100 as in COCO [here](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval)?\r\n\r\nRecall in this repo is simply TP / ground truth number of objects. Remember pycocotools also reports their own seperate statistics, which you can see using the `--save-json` flag with test.py.\r\n\r\n> 4. So far, the recall is still only ~54.7% (Fig. 1), is it true to expect recall value of 77.3% in the end of epoch? (274 epochs)\r\n\r\nActually, we believe we misinterpreted darknet training settings, so you should only need 68 epochs now to reach full training (1/4 of the previous number). The latest updates has this change implemented. We are also working on GIoU tests, which we may commit in the next few days.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Many thanks.\r\n> \r\n> Fig. 1:\r\n> ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/40333aca30bb34c9d0845180e917121602c4d8ac/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f424c7a4c375a4b2f32343165706f63682d726573756c742e706e673f7261773d74727565)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/502312565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/502350708","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/330#issuecomment-502350708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/330","id":502350708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjM1MDcwOA==","user":{"login":"ardianumam","id":12822715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIyNzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12822715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam","html_url":"https://github.com/ardianumam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardianumam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-15T09:26:37Z","updated_at":"2019-06-15T09:26:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> 4.

: thanks for the quick reply! Yes, comparing 'from-the-scratch' training result to the original paper accuracy, it may have differences: (i) multi-scale training (as you said above), and (ii) the use of imageNet pretrained model, 160 epochs for initial 224x224 resolution followed by 10 fine-tuning-epochs for 448x448 resolution which is claimed having 4% mAP increase. \r\n\r\nSo, for the table result you report [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map), in the `ultralytics/yolov3` column, how did you train to get those mAP, including the `yolov3-spp` versions?
