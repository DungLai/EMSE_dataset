The second step runs a genetic algorithm which directly minimizes the IOUs of the anchor boxes (the kmeans only minimizes the w-h distances).

Checked the LoadImagesAndLabels function that creates the .shapes and I couldn't find the problem. There is a try and except that should create the .shape file for validation properly.. When we delete all .shapes files before starting the training, everything goes well and both files get created.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nFYI, I've seen improvements in our custom training using kmeans calculated anchors, but our bndbox are also alot different in shape than those of coco..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/572707385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ownmarc","id":24617457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE3NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24617457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc","html_url":"https://github.com/Ownmarc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ownmarc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/583866866","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/728#issuecomment-583866866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/728","id":583866866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mzg2Njg2Ng==","user":{"login":"FranciscoReveriano","id":48685139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njg1MTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48685139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano","html_url":"https://github.com/FranciscoReveriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranciscoReveriano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-09T16:48:12Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T16:48:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I personally got better results using custom anchors.
