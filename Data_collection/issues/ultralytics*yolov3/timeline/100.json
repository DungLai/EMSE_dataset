we have a customer similarly interested in action detection, so I've also started investigating it. \r\n\r\nAt the simplest level, a video can be thought of as a hyperspectral image, so for example instead of a 1x3x416x416 color image being fed into YOLOv3 you could feed it instead a 1x30x416x416 black and white video that is 1 second long (at 30 FPS) or say 10 seconds long at 3 FPS. \r\n\r\nThe simplest targets would simply be a boolean vector for whether the action is present in the video or not (detection). Regression elements for localizing bounding boxes, especially ones that move over time is a much more difficult, more open ended task.\r\n\r\nBut to simply get started with action detection, you can feed a video clip to yolo by modifying the input filters from 3 (one for each color) to say 30, one for each frame in your black and white, 30-frame long clip, and modifying the yolo layers as
