had the same problem and I think I found a solution. When resuming from a checkpoint the optimizer is loaded into the `lr_scheduler` but no `last_epoch` argument is added in the constructor. It is set afterwards as `scheduler.last_epoch = start_epoch` in train.py. This leads to a bug as the constructor has already initialized the scheduler in a way that was dependent on the `last_epoch` argument to be set (see source code of lr_scheduler for details https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/optim/lr_scheduler.html#LambdaLR).\r\n\r\nThe **proposed solution** is to pass the correct `start_epoch` in the constructor as such:\r\n`scheduler = lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda=lf,last_epoch = start_epoch)`\r\nNote that if you resume training and also change the total number of episodes, this will lead to another learning rate being calculated as the `lr_lambda` function is dependent on the total number of episodes. \r\nHope this will help and thank you for an otherwise excellent implementation! \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597696202/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apamildner","id":10640074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10640074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner","html_url":"https://github.com/apamildner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apamildner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3119832080,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzExOTgzMjA4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3119832080","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T17:32:36Z","rename":{"from":"when I resume to train a model from a breakpoint , the loss will greater than before. what lead this?","to":"Loss Increase after Resuming from last.pt"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/597769757","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/902#issuecomment-597769757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/902","id":597769757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Nzc2OTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T17:36:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T17:38:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Papibarozza ah thank you for your proposed fix.

commit 320f9c6601ae1bddae036a5094dfe81ac1441cc3 should fix this now. Passing last_epoch = start_epoch led to an error, so I used start_epoch - 1, which I think is better, since at epoch 0 this will read at -1, the default value.\r\n\r\nI think this might create the scheduler warning again though, i will need to check. Ah, no everything seems fine. Ok great! I have not checked whether this fixes the error on resume training, but it doesn't seem to be hurting anything at the start of training, so I will leave it as is following the
