@glenn-jocher. I especially appreciate you mentioning the need to apply NMS after inferencing with the model. Is this something that's cooked into the darknet executable's detector function (used to perform inference using a trained Darknet-based model)? I.e. when it's used like so:\r\n```\r\n$ ./darknet detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights\r\n``` \r\nIt may be that this is also cooked into the inference plugins I'll be using with DeepStream, but if not it's good to have the heads up.\r\n\r\nI'm a neophyte with TensorRT as well. My understanding is that the conversion of a model into a TensorRT engine is an optimization that allows for it to be run on NVIDIA GPUs at a much higher frame rate with more or less the same level of accuracy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/535541139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"monocongo","id":1328158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjgxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1328158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo","html_url":"https://github.com/monocongo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2665591511,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY2NTU5MTUxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2665591511","actor":{"login":"monocongo","id":1328158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjgxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1328158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo","html_url":"https://github.com/monocongo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monocongo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T14:51:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2665591516,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2NTU5MTUxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2665591516","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T14:51:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2665591518,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NjU1OTE1MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2665591518","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T14:51:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/535949539","html_url":"https://github.com/ult

yes the darknet function applies NMS written in C to the model output. The model output itself is something like 10647 x 85, and then NMS whittles that down to just a few n x 85 vectors. In the iOS app the CoreML framework offers this and we pipeline YOLOv3 with an NMS model to produce the visible results you see in the iDetection iOS app.\r\n\r\nIf you run the model in PyTorch here we have PyTorch code that runs NMS on the model output.

yes pytorch should be more flexible than darknet as your export options are a bit more established. The optimizations are probably something you want to think about after the whole export pipeline is up and running and producing results. Maybe the default settings serve you well enough, it's hard to predict, you simply need to build it and run it, and then tweak as necessary.
