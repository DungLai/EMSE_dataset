@glenn-jocher,  firstly, thanks for your great work! \r\nI also have a similar problem with this issue. When I train on my own dataset with single class, using 4 GPUs，with batch_size is 16, the R and P and mAP are all low, mAP is only 0.25 no matter how many epoch I train, and if I stop training and restart training with --resume, the P and R and mAP will all near 0.99, I think this result is not correct, because when I test the model on a picture, it can not detect anything. Then I go back to check the test_batch0_pred.jpg, I found that only 1/4 of the pictures were detected normally, and the remaining 3/4 of the pictures were not detected at all，so I guess this result has something to do with multi GPU training. Then I tried to train on a single GPU, at this time, the network converges normally after a few epoch as expected. But after training more than 10 epochs, loss becomes non and the training stops.\r\nI hope you can help me to solve these two questions. Thank you again for your outstanding work！\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/626551528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"suzhr3","id":23237364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjM3MzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23237364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3","html_url":"https://github.com/suzhr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzhr3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3321830658,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMyMTgzMDY1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3321830658","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T08:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3321830659,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMjE4MzA2NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3321830659","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T08:23:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/626772494","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1152#issuecomment-626772494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1152","id":626772494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjc3MjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T15:23:27Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T15:23:27Z","author_association

Not only this recall and map issue, but also the \"expected xxx on cuda, but found on 'cpu'\" problem in training(no --multi-scale) and testing (this line \"_ = model(torch.zeros((1, 3, imgsz, imgsz), device=device)) if device.type != 'cpu' else None  # run once\"  on test.py).\r\nI've decided to run on docker now. I think you are also running on docker.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: Sorry for my carelessness, docker doesn't solve this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/643700260/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nightsnack","id":15212462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjEyNDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15212462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack","html_url":"https://github.com/nightsnack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightsnack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/643700619","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1152#issuecomment-643700619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1152","id":643700619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzcwMDYxOQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-14T00:37:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-14T00:37:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nightsnack yes, we train on GCP, docker and colab.
