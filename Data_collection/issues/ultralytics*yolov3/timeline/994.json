As I know, the YOLO paper sets `confidence = Pr(object)*IOU`. For anchors responsible for any targets, the confidence should just be the 1*IOU (or better GIOU), which does help with the NMS. What I am concerned about is the variable `model.gr`, which is set to 0.0 in first 3 epochs. And about the link of prebias, after searching with 'prebias' in all the files, I still didn't find it...\r\n2. Is the number 64 comes from batch_size(16) * accumulate(4)?
