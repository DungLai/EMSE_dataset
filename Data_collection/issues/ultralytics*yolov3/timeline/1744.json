thank you for the quick reply. I kind of found a way to make it work on my local machine, but not in the container. When installing pytorch and the dependencies using conda (except OpenCV and Tensorboard which I install using pip), I get the same images. When installing everything using pip and requirements.txt, then it works perfectly, which is kind of counterintuitive since official Pytorch website recommends using conda. Pip installs Pytorch 1.8.1 w/ CUDA 10.2 support by default while the conda and docker versions seems to be installed with CUDA 11. I also tried installing Pytorch 1.8.1 w/ CUDA 11.1 using pip and it also didn't work. So I guess this is a CUDA compatibility problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/823300614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"denishem","id":48387052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzg3MDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48387052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem","html_url":"https://github.com/denishem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denishem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4619436514,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYxOTQzNjUxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4619436514","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-20T14:03:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4619436521,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MTk0MzY1MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/4619436521","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-20T14:03:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/823323077","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1744#issuecomment-823323077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1744","id":823323077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzMyMzA3Nw==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-20T14:32:02Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T14:32:02Z",
