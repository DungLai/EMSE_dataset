dy":"@hgjung3 also I believe the darknet-trained weights involved a few steps not mentioned in the publication. The latest ultralytics/yolov3 trained results are about 1% below the published results, though I believe training darknet normally will not get you to the same value either.\r\n\r\nAlso the utility of the backbone seems questionable, as the best results so far (to 273 epochs) have come without the backbone, using randomly initialized weights. Note that --multi-scale seems important too.\r\n\r\nI think off the top of my head if you wanted to train to the best mAP, you could use the default settings but add --multi-scale, and possibly lower the positive weights on the two BCE losses, as these seem to overfit  before 273, especially the objectness loss. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/453 for this specific issue. \r\n\r\nNote also that darknet doesn't do any loss balancing, but we were unable to get good results this way, which is

Thanks for your reply. So, I can summarize the situation as follows (I assume the default input size as 416):\r\n\r\n1. The mAPs on https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map were produced by the darknet weights, which means you used the weights provided by the author of YOLOv3 but used your test.py and the settings.\r\n2. If we train the model based on the master branch, we can have similar results that are possibly a little bit lower than those of the original paper.\r\n3. So, the best (or **reasonable**) mAPs can be yielded by your code with the following settings (w/o SPP):\r\n`python3 train.py --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg --multi-scale`\r\n4. The above initializes the parameters of darknet53 randomly. So another possible option is:\r\n`python3 train.py --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg --weights weights/darknet53.conv.74 --multi-scale`\r\n5. In addition to 3 and 4, #453 tells us that adjusting hyp['obj_pw'] and hyp['cls_pw'] might give us higher mAPs.\r\n6. Generally, this code exploits the mechanisms of the original paper (Yolov2 and v3) but some parts are adjusted or added.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if something is wrong.\r\nAnd another question: In your opinion, the 237 epochs are needed for training with your code? I will do the experimnets of 3 and 4 above now but I want to save my resources (times, machines,...)\r\n\r\nThanks again!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/534998087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hgjung3","id":24726351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzI2MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24726351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3","html_url":"https://github.com/hgjung3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2661486052,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2MTQ4NjA1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2661486052","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-25T12:28:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2661486054,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NjE0ODYwNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2661486054","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-25T12:28:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/535026200","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/521#issuecomment-535026200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/521","id":535026200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTAyNjIwMA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T13:36:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T13:36:30Z","author_associa

yes all of those points are correct, except 237 epochs is 273 epochs, which is about 500,000 iterations on the original darknet.

thanks! We want to guide the repo in the AutoML direction, to make it easier for people to import their data and train with setting best suited for their own datasets. And I think we are very close to reproducing (and then perhaps exceeding!) the published mAP results.\r\n\r\nBTW on that topic I have some news. Two of our training runs just finished, and I discovered that removing the positive weights helps a bit for final mAP. We trained two models at 320 with and without the positive weights (but neither with multi-scale), and we ended up with 48.8 and 49.3 mAP. So based on these results we are going to train with multi-scale now with pw's set to 1.0. It's a tradeoff though, as at the 0.10 conf_thres level the positive weights return better mAP, but at the final testing conf_thres of 0.001 they hurt the results. The positive weight definitely seem to cause overfitting towards the end though as you can see. \r\n\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/65680578-83d40e80-e057-11e9-93bb-04df0da08f4e.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/535439751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2664727514,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2NDcyNzUxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2664727514","actor":{"login":"hgjung3","id":24726351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzI2MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24726351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3","html_url":"https://github.com/hgjung3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T10:20:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2664727516,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NjQ3Mjc1MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2664727516","actor":{"login":"hgjung3","id":24726351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzI2MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24726351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3","html_url":"https://github.com/hgjung3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hgjung3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-26T10:20:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
