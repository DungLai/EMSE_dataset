👋 hi, thanks for letting us know about this problem with YOLOv5 🚀. We've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started investigating a possible problem.\r\n\r\n## How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nWhen asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide code that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Your code that reproduces the problem should be:\r\n\r\n* ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem\r\n* ✅ **Complete** – Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself\r\n* ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above requirements, for [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code should be:\r\n\r\n* ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with current GitHub [master](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.\r\n* ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this repository. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.\r\n\r\nIf you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose) and providing a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us better understand and diagnose your problem. \r\n\r\nThank you! 😃
