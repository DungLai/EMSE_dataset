yes this is correct. obj and cls will typically overtrain faster than iou, it is one of the issues that we are looking at currently. This usually creates a scenario where iou has not converged yet, but obj and cls val losses begin increasing, forcing early stopping of the training. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately increasing or lowering hyp['giou'] does not seem to help much in this case. Perhaps the best solution might be to reduce obj and cls hyps to near zero individually as they begin to overtrain, while leaving giou training going
