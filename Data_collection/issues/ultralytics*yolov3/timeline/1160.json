I train on my custom dataset which has 4 classes.

Why the `hyp['cls']` can be so small compared to the original 37.4?\r\n2. The plot of `hyp['cls']` seems different from the others. The value of `hyp['cls']` jumps from 0.121 to 1.87 suddenly, while the others are increasing smoothly.\r\n3. Why the best result can be up to 0.9 while the others are only less than 0.5?\r\n4. After 10 loops of evolution, only the `hyp['cls']` have been changed while the others are all the same as the original value, is that normal?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your

yes this is an odd result. One of your runs was much better than the rest for some reason. Ah, I think I see what's happened. As hyp['cls'] updates each round it's gotten progressively smaller. This will require an update to the code to corrrect. The origin of the problem is a code that scales hyp cls, which we implemented recently and have not evolved since. This line modifies the value inplace by scaling it with cls
