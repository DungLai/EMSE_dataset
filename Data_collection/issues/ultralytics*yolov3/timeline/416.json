Classification's only purpose in life is to determine which category a detection falls into. With only one category, your data will always be the same category, and thus it quickly learns to trivially output that category.\r\n\r\nWidth/Height is zero because GIoU is handling all regression for the boxes, which includes xy and wh. The balance of positive and negative examples is not bad.\r\n\r\n- In terms of training, your results appear excellent. 0.80 mAP is a very good result.\r\n- In terms of generalization to new documents, your results could benefit from many more samples. The more the merrier, but something closer to 10k images would generalize much better I imagine.\r\n\r\nAccording to your training results you should be detecting about 80% of the signatures correctly, with a false positive every 3 or 4 documents. To run detections using your trained network, place some images in the data/samples folder, and run your trained network on them:\r\n\r\n`python3 detect.py --cfg cfg/your_cfg_file.cfg --weights
