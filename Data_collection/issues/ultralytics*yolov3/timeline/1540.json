Thank you for showing how to do it in code. It was really very helpful. For yolov3 I used layers 36, 61 and 74, as I figured out that layer count starts from 0 (i from the for loop). My input image size is 192x320 therefore I am getting the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlayer: 36, torch.Size([1, 256, 24, 40])\r\nlayer: 61, torch.Size([1, 512, 12, 20])\r\nlayer: 74, torch.Size([1, 1024, 6, 10])\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy plan is to locate the detected object in these feature maps (object bounding box * 1/feature map stride) and take average across all channels and scales.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/719529794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"khalidw","id":31723666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzIzNjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31723666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3941020291,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk0MTAyMDI5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3941020291","actor":{"login":"WZMIAOMIAO","id":31005897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDA1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31005897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO","html_url":"https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-30T12:42:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3941020297,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NDEwMjAyOTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3941020297","actor":{"login":"WZMIAOMIAO","id":31005897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDA1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31005897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO","html_url":"https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZMIAOMIAO/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-30T12:42:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3949237514,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk0OTIzNzUxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3949237514","actor":{"login":"khalidw","id":31723666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzIzNjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31723666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-02T17:20:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/817330613","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1540#issuecomment-817330613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/
