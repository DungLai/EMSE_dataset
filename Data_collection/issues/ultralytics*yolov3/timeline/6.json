Then, the same network is fine-tuned with 448x448 images for 10 epochs. For the detection task, the last CONV layer of **Darknet-19** is removed and some extra layers are added to create YOLO9000 detection architecture. Extra layers are probably initialized with random weights as mentioned in section 2.2 of [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).\r\n\r\nYOLOV3 uses **Darknet-53**  instead of **Darknet-19** (section 2.4 of [YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)). I have assumed that the last layers of **Darknet-53** is discarded and the resulting weights are used to initialize YOLOV3 (up to line 549 in [yolov3.cfg](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)). Then, some extra layers (randomly initialized) are added to create YOLOV3. \r\n\r\nAs you have mentioned, `-opt.resume = False`, initializes all layers with random weights. Because of that, the training might take longer time to converge or might not converge to a good solution.

dy":"@LalitPradhan \r\nI highly recommend you to read **Training YOLO on VOC** section on https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/. I have not used transfer learning for yolov3 before, so I can only give you suggestions for training from scratch. However, I suggest training all the layers with a lower learning rate instead of just training yolo layers for transfer learning following [How transferable are features in deep neural networks?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792.pdf).  @glenn-jocher Btw, what are the trainable parameters for yolo layer? If there are some parameters, shouldn't https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights contain yolo parameters as well?\r\n\r\nYou could use the following steps as a guide to train yolov3 on your dataset:\r\n\r\n1. Darknet53 is trained on ImageNet 1000 class classification dataset. If your dataset is very different from ImageNet (like satellite images), you should probably train Darknet53 from scratch. \r\n\r\n2. You should generate labels for your dataset in yolo3 format by modifying `https://pjreddie.com/media/files/voc_label.py`. Follow the steps provided on https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ for VOC dataset to learn how you should present your dataset and its labels. If the code runs successfully, you should see a labels directory containing a .txt file for each image with a line for each ground truth object in the image that looks like:\r\n`<object-class> <x> <y> <width> <height>`\r\nwhere x, y, width, and height are relative to the image's width and height. Be sure that x, y, width, and height are not outside of range [0,1].  `voc_label.py`should also generate a .txt file containing the paths for every image in the dataset (or the training set if you do not want to train yolov3 on the whole dataset).\r\n\r\n3. Next, modify https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/data/coco.names and https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/cfg/coco.data for your dataset. `train` should point at .txt file containing the paths for every image in your training set and classes should be equal to number of classes in your dataset.\r\n\r\n4. Now, you should use k-means to calculate the anchor box size for your dataset. You can use https://github.com/Jumabek/darknet_scripts.\r\n\r\n5. Modify anchors and classes terms of yolo layers in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg for your dataset. Be careful to sort anchors with respect to their area in ascending order because the first yolo layer detects the biggest 3 anchors `(mask = 6,7,8)`, the second yolo layer detects the next biggest 3 anchors `(mask = 3,4,5)` and the last yolo layer detects the smallest 3 anchors `(mask = 0,1,2)`.\r\n\r\n6. Load the pretrained Darknet53 weights and initialize weights after conv_73 randomly. Use the same learning rate for all yolov3 layers during the training. In the original yolov3 code, \"steps\" learning rate policy is used with \"burn-in\". It is implemented in this repo. You can read issue #18 for further information.\r\n\r\n

for your improvement of this YOLOv3 implementation.\r\nI have just test the training ,got some problem .\r\nI follow these steps.\r\n1. load the original yolov3.weight to the model\r\n2. train it on coco2014 with your train.py.\r\n3.Got the following logs ,the precision is down fast from 0.5->0.1. but recall is up to 0.35.\r\nsee Screenshot here\r\n![log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28760530/45008052-2677b480-b033-11e8-837a-361da3b012b4.png)\r\n\r\n4.I save the weight with precision0.2, and run the detect.py\r\nthe result like this , \r\n![000000000019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28760530/44996478-b2112700-afda-11e8-9399-eec286192a96.jpg)\r\nif I do not train,the orginal wight can get this result:\r\n![000000000019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28760530/45008197-d6e5b880-b033-11e8-89dc-97541686dd55.jpg)\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I used wrong parameters or something else, lead to generation of many bbox .\r\ncould you give me some suggestion?\r\nThank you~\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1951052160,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk1MTA1MjE2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1951052160","actor":{"login":"okanlv","id":29547397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTQ3Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29547397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv","html_url":"https://github.com/okanlv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-07T08:53:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"okanlv","id":29547397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTQ3Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29547397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv","html_url":"https://github.com/okanlv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okanlv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T08:59:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T08:59:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/9","id":358487124,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTg0ODcxMjQ=","number":9,"title":"Can
