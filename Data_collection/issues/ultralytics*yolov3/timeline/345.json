You can always add an angle parameter (if your training data has it), though there will be a significant nonlinearity in this 5D space where the angle stitches from say -180 to +180 deg, or 359 to 0 deg. You would simply resize the YOLO layers to the new shape, and run a sigmoid activation on the angle output so that it ranges from 0 to 1 (i.e. 0 to 360 deg), or a tanh activation so it ranges from -1 to 1 (i.e. -180 to 180).\r\n\r\nYou might want to think about other ways to express your information though, such as regressing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the rotated bounding boxes rather than the box and the angle. Remember you are going to need some way to calculate IoU, or a comparable metric, on your results.

How do you compute IoU on  rotated bounding boxes?\r\n\r\nmAP at 0.875 like you have there is very good BTW. COCO mAP is around 0.6 to compare. \r\n\r\nAlso, remember the hyperparameters and training settings are set for COCO, you'll likely want to adjust them to your specific task.
