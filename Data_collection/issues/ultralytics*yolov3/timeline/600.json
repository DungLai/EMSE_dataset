This seems to be caused by multiple dataloader workers being applied to a single image. To fix this you'll likely need to hardcode `num_workers=0` into the dataloader arguments, and do the same in test.py.  Though as a general point, there is no good use of training a single image. You're much better served looking at the custom data training page on the wiki and ignoring the single image
