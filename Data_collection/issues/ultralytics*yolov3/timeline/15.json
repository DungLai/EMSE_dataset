do you have an exact definition of the learning rate over the training? I tried switching to SGD and implementing a burn-in phase but was unsuccessful, the losses diverged before the burn-in completed.\r\n\r\nFrom darknet I think the correct burnin in formula is this, which will slowly ramp up the LR to 1e-3 after 1000 iterations and leave it there:\r\n```python\r\n# SGD burn-in\r\nif (epoch == 0) & (i <= 1000):\r\n    power = ??\r\n    lr = 1e-3 * (i / 1000) ** power\r\n    for g in optimizer.param_groups:\r\n        g['lr'] = lr\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't find the correct value of power though. I tried with `power=2` and training diverged around 200 iterations. Increasing to `power=5` training diverges after 400 iterations. `power=10` also diverges. \r\n\r\nI see that the divergence is in the width and height losses, the other terms appear fine. I think one problem may be that the width and height terms are bound at zero at the bottom, but are unbound at the top, so its possible that the network is predicting impossibly large widths and heights, causing the losses there to diverge. I may need to bound these or redefine the width and height terms and try again. I used a variant of the width and height terms for a different project that had no divergence problems with SGD.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/422996246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1856397631,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg1NjM5NzYzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1856397631","actor":{"login":"bobo0810","id":26057879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU3ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26057879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810","html_url":"https://github.com/bobo0810","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-20T00:01:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1856397632,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NTYzOTc2MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/1856397632","actor":{"login":"bobo0810","id":26057879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU3ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26057879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810","html_url":"https://github.com/bobo0810","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobo0810/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-20T00:01:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/423239898","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/15#issuecomment-423239898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/15","id":423239898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzIzOTg5OA==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-20T16:04:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T16:04:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bobo0810
