validation mAP is lower than expected. \r\n\r\n**observation** If we test a serialized version of the ddp model (i.e serialize to disk using torch.save and then serialize using torch.load), the validation mAP is fine.\r\n\r\n**fix** During training instead of running test.test using the model that is being currently trained using DDP, write a temporary checkpoint to disk and tell test to create a new model and load that checkpoint and run validation with it. \r\n\r\n**Why does it work?** No idea. Just dumb luck I guess. If I had to guess, it looks like when we move model.module.yolo_layers to model.yolo_layers after DDP init, and then switch to eval using model.eval(), it may not be switching eval on for the yolo_layers since they're outside model.module.  OR, it might have something to do with the test dataloader. \r\n\r\nThe minor changes required for train.py & test.py can be viewed here: https://github.com/akshaychawla/yolov3/commit/4e5eaab4907e037579f6690296fe3d556c621d4e \r\n\r\nAnother observation is that when I increased batch-size to 128 and train the model, I was expecting it to perform worse because higher batch size means less gradient updates which means less performance. BUT, this repository has support for gradient accumulation using loss *= batchsize / 64 which I think was initially designed for cases where batchsize < 64. But for bs>64, it has the effect of scaling up the loss, which is same as scaling the learning rate hyp['lr0'] to accommodate higher batch-sizes. But more importantly, it speed up training. \r\n\r\n\r\n| #gpu | Time to 300 epochs (hrs) |\r\n|------|--------------------------|\r\n| 1    | 42.843                   |\r\n| 2    | 36.740                   |\r\n| 4    | 26.455                   | \r\n\r\nLogs, results and checkpoints available at: Edit. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CN50wq-e0COr9RnWPtBHgj8z-AfFBq6?usp=sharing \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/675615055/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/675618101","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1436#issuecomment-675618101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1436","id":675618101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTYxODEwMQ==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-18T17:39:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T17:40:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@akshaychawla thanks so much for the detailed analysis!

problems.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/675618101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3667434243,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY2NzQzNDI0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3667434243","actor":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-18T17:39:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3667434247,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2Njc0MzQyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/3667434247","actor":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-18T17:39:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/675622983","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1436#issuecomment-675622983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1436","id":675622983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTYyMjk4Mw==","user":{"login":"akshaychawla","id":8658591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTg1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8658591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla","html_url":"https://github.com/akshaychawla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshaychawla/received_events","type":"User","site_ad
