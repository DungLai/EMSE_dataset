Hence, I haven't created a proper github repository for documentation purposes. However, recently I just succeeded to stream RGB and depth data from Intel RealSense D435.\r\n\r\n![contoh github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60618490/74004270-e1824b00-49a7-11ea-9f83-5837d4bf34c9.png) \r\n\r\nI developed an extra class in utils.dataset (thanks to @glenn-jocher 's repository) named LoadRealSense2 to stream RGB and depth frames. The class is as follows, pardon me in advance if there are still comments in the Indonesian language, you can just ask me for further explanation\r\n:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass LoadRealSense2:  # Stream from Intel RealSense D435\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, width='640', height='480', fps='30'):\r\n\r\n        # Variabels for setup\r\n        self.width = width\r\n        self.height = height\r\n        self.fps = fps\r\n        self.imgs = [None]\r\n        self.depths = [None]\r\n        self.img_size = 416\r\n        self.half = False\r\n\r\n        # Setup\r\n        self.pipe = rs.pipeline()\r\n        self.cfg = rs.config()\r\n        self.cfg.enable_stream(rs.stream.depth, self.width, self.height, rs.format.z16, self.fps)\r\n        self.cfg.enable_stream(rs.stream.color, self.width, self.height, rs.format.bgr8, self.fps)\r\n\r\n        # Start streaming\r\n        self.profile = self.pipe.start(self.cfg)\r\n        self.path = rs.pipeline_profile()\r\n        print(self.path)\r\n\r\n        print(\"streaming at w = \" + str(self.width) + \" h = \" + str(self.height) + \" fps = \" + str(self.fps))\r\n\r\n    def update(self):\r\n\r\n        while True:\r\n            #Wait for frames and get the data\r\n            self.frames = self.pipe.wait_for_frames()\r\n            self.depth_frame = self.frames.get_depth_frame()\r\n            self.color_frame = self.frames.get_color_frame()\r\n\r\n            #Wait until RGB and depth frames are synchronised\r\n            if not self.depth_frame or not self.color_frame:\r\n                continue\r\n            #get RGB data and convert it to numpy array\r\n            img0 = np.asanyarray(self.color_frame.get_data())\r\n            #print(\"ini image awal: \" + str(np.shape(img0)))\r\n\r\n            #align + color depth -> for display purpose only\r\n            #udah di convert ke numpy array di def colorizing\r\n            depth0 = self.colorizing(self.aligned(self.frames))\r\n\r\n            # aligned depth -> for depth calculation\r\n            # udah di convert ke numpy array di def kedalaman\r\n            distance0 = self.kedalaman(self.frames)\r\n\r\n            #get depth_scale\r\n            depth_scale = self.scale(self.profile)\r\n\r\n            #Expand dimensi image biar jadi 4 dimensi (biar bisa masuk ke fungsi letterbox)\r\n            self.imgs = np.expand_dims(img0, axis=0)\r\n            #print(\"ini img expand: \" + str(np.shape(self.imgs)))\r\n\r\n            #Kalo yang depth gaperlu, karena gaakan dimasukin ke YOLO\r\n            self.depths = depth0\r\n            self.distance = distance0\r\n            break\r\n\r\n        #print(\"ini depth awal: \" + str(np.shape(self.depths)))\r\n\r\n        s = np.stack([letterbox(x, new_shape=self.img_size)[0].shape for x in self.imgs], 0)  # inference shapes\r\n        #print(\"ini s: \" + str(np.shape(s)))\r\n\r\n        self.rect = np.unique(s, axis=0).shape[0] == 1\r\n        #print(\"ini rect: \" + str(np.shape(self.rect)))\r\n\r\n        if not self.rect:\r\n            print('WARNING: Different stream shapes detected.
