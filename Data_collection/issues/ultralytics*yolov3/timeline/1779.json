body":"@glenn-jocher thanks, then there indeed appears to be some problem. Please let me know if you'd like me to report the following as a bug (although it's more likely to be incorrect use by us, I think). This is our exact process:\r\nWe call the train this way:\r\npython train.py --batch 1 --epochs 1 --data leaf.yaml --weights yolov3.pt\r\n\r\nThis is our leaf.yaml (which is the only place were we specify the class number and name):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33690998/120211160-4c106780-c239-11eb-8898-06661cade933.png)\r\n\r\nThe specified leaf_2012_train.txt files contain the path to the training (/testing/val) images respectively. \r\n\r\nAfter this finishes, we run the detect, this way:\r\npython detect.py --source ../leaf/images/train --weights yolov3.pt --conf 0.25\r\n\r\nIt outputs a result image per image in the dataset. On many of them, there are no predications (to be expected, as the training was for 1 epoch only), but on one of them, there are predictions labeled from the coco dataset:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33690998/120212255-6dbe1e80-c23a-11eb-9a8a-8252ab6dad29.png)\r\n\r\nIs there something wrong in our usage of the repo? We have attempted to follow the tutorial exactly. Perhaps there is some configuration change that we should have done that I have not listed?\r\n\r\nThanks

Indeed. The problem was that we thought the trained weights are outputted to the same file they were inputted in the call to train (yolov3.pt), but they are not - they are outputed to the (originally only containing a script to download the pretrained weights) \"weights\" directory (and only at the end of each epoch, I think?).\r\nNow that we are actually using the correct learned weights (ie best.pt), we see that indeed the network is only aware of the classes in our dataset.\r\nThanks again for the quick and kind
