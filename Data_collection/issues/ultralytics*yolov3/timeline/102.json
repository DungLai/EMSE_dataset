we divide x and w by the image width 640, and y and h by the image height 427 we get:\r\n```\r\n[0.3692, 0.3265, 0.0133, 0.1104] = \r\n[236.35 / 640, 139.42 / 427, 8.56 / 640, 47.16 / 427]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich does not match our darknet labels. So the COCO xy coordinates must then represent the bottom corner point of the bounding box rather than its center. If we correct for this offset then the results match. And in the COCO link above you can see it says \"box coordinates are measured from the top left image corner\".\r\n```\r\n[0.3759, 0.3817, 0.0133, 0.1104] = \r\n[(236.35 + 8.56/2) / 640, (139.42 +
