This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your modified or out-of-date code**. If your issue is not reproducible in a new `git clone` version of this repo we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and verify your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 yolov5_new  # clone latest\r\n$ cd yolov5_new\r\n$ python detect.py  # verify detection\r\n\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible in one of our 3 common datasets ([COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco.yaml), [COCO128](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco128.yaml), or [VOC](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/voc.yaml)) we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of your labels and images.\r\n\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, verify your environment meets all of the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies specified below. If in doubt, download Python 3.8.0 from https://www.python.org/, create a new [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), and install requirements.\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**. Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPython 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, including `torch>=1.7`. To install run:\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environments\r\n\r\nYOLOv5 may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments (with all dependencies including [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda)/[CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):\r\n\r\n- **Google Colab Notebook** with free GPU: <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a>\r\n- **Kaggle Notebook** with free GPU: [https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov5](https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov5)\r\n- **Google Cloud** Deep Learning VM. See [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) \r\n- **Docker Image** https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov5. See [Docker Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Docker-Quickstart) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/yolov5?logo=docker)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n![CI CPU testing](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/workflows/CI%20CPU%20testing/badge.svg)\r\n\r\nIf this badge is green, all [YOLOv5 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/actions) Continuous Integration (CI) tests are passing. These tests evaluate proper operation of basic YOLOv5 functionality, including training ([train.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/train.py)), testing ([test.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/test.py)), inference ([detect.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/detect.py)) and export ([export.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/export.py)) on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/751864595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/751954958","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1628#issuecomment-751954958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1628","id":751954958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTk1NDk1OA==","user":{"login":"erolgerceker","id":58424097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDI0MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58424097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker","html_url":"https://github.com/erolgerceker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erolgerceker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-29T05:45:22Z","updated_at":"2020-12-29T05:46:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i
