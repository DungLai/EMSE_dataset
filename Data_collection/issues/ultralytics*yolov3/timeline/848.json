original darknet learning rate (LR) scheduler parameters are set in a model's *.cfg file:\r\n- `learning_rate`: initial LR\r\n- `burn_in`: number of batches to ramp LR from 0 to `learning_rate` in epoch 0\r\n- `max_batches`: the number of batches to train the model to\r\n- `policy`: type of LR scheduler\r\n- `steps`: batch numbers at which LR is reduced\r\n- `scales`: LR multiple applied at `steps` (`gamma` in PyTorch)\r\n<img width=\"555\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-24 at 12 38 18\"

We set the initial and final LRs as hyperparameters `hyp['lr0']` and `hyp['lrf']`, where the final LR `= lr0 * (10 ** lrf)` . For example, if the initial LR is 0.001 and the final LR is 100 times (1e-2) smaller, `hyp['lrf']=0.001` and `hyp['lrf']=-2`. This plot shows two of the available PyTorch LR schedulers, with the MultiStepLR scheduler following the original darknet implementation (at `batch_size=64` on COCO).

You may want to set your own scheduler according to your specific custom dataset and training requirements, and also adjust it's hyperparameters accordingly.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/bd2378fad1578e7d7722ad846458ad7a2bb43442/train.py#L102-L109","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/590030417","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/848#issuecomment-590030417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/848","id":590030417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDAzMDQxNw==","user":{"login":"gnefihs","id":46212010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjEyMDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46212010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs","html_url":"https://github.com/gnefihs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnefihs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T05:53:39Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T06:27:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@glenn-jocher
