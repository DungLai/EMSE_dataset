PyTorch offers many options for custom LR schedules. See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the current setup is COCO training to 273 epochs (500k iterations at 64 images per batch). On custom datasets we recommend training to as many epochs as possible, i.e. 1000k epochs or more. After looking at results.png see when your validation losses begin to increase, and then restart training in a fresh run with `--epochs` set to the point of overfitting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/573147969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2939421351,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkzOTQyMTM1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2939421351","actor":{"login":"cesarandreslopez","id":14029177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI5MTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14029177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez","html_url":"https://github.com/cesarandreslopez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-10T18:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2939421353,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5Mzk0MjEzNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2939421353","actor":{"login":"cesarandreslopez","id":14029177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDI5MTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14029177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez","html_url":"https://github.com/cesarandreslopez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cesarandreslopez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-10T18:17:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/575300422","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/760#issuecomment-575300422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/760","id":575300422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTMwMDQyMg==","user":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.
