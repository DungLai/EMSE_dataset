thank you for your interest in our work! It sounds like you have incorrectly configured your cfg file. Please note that most technical problems are due to:\r\n\r\n- **Your changes to the default repository**. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh `git clone` version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 && cd yolov3 # git clone latest\r\npython3 detect.py  # verify detection\r\npython3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)\r\n# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE\r\n```\r\n- **Your custom data.** If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our [Custom Training Tutorial](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine `train_batch0.jpg` and `test_batch0.jpg` for a sanity check of training and testing data.\r\n- **Your environment.** If your issue is not reproducible in a [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python >= 3.7, Pytorch >= 1.0, etc. \r\n\r\nIf none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the **Bug Report template**, providing screenshots and **minimum viable code to reproduce your issue**.

you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/489611251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2320897481,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMyMDg5NzQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2320897481","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-06T12:59:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/494266527","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/263#issuecomment-494266527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/263","id":494266527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDI2NjUyNw==","user":{"login":"ibatra","id":27257121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjU3MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27257121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra","html_url":"https://github.com/ibatra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibatra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T07:04:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T07:04:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"facing
