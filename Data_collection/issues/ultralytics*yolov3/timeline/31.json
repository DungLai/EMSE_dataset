This error indicates that your module has parameters that were not used in producing its output (the return value of `forward`). You can enable unused parameter detection by passing the keyword argument `find_unused_parameters=True` to `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. If you already have this argument set, then the distributed data parallel module wasn't able to locate the output tensors in the return value of your module's `forward` function.
