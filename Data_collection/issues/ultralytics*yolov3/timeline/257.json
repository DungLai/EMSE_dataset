Has anyone else succeeded in putting their PyTorch model on an app? I was able to convert my model to CoreML. I tried to drop the model into this app https://github.com/Ma-Dan/YOLOv3-CoreML with some minor changes, where I: 1) changed the number of classes, 2) changed the feature assertion sizes, and 3) changed the ONNX export in this repo to output the input to the three Yolo layers (instead of the output of the Yolo layers) because I think that's what the app's Yolo class expects as output format. This has been an unsuccessful endeavor.
