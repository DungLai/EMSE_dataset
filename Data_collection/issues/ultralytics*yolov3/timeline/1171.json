I have a question about the loss function code  when calculating the bbox loss. \r\n\r\n # GIoU\r\n            pxy = torch.sigmoid(ps[:, 0:2])  # pxy = pxy * s - (s - 1) / 2,  s = 1.5  (scale_xy)\r\n            pwh = torch.exp(ps[:, 2:4]).clamp(max=1E3) * anchor_vec[i]\r\n            pbox = torch.cat((pxy, pwh), 1)  # predicted box\r\n            giou = bbox_iou(pbox.t(), tbox[i], x1y1x2y2=False, GIoU=True)  # giou computation\r\n            lbox += (1.0 - giou).sum() if red == 'sum' else (1.0 - giou).mean()  # giou loss\r\n            tobj[b, a, gj, gi] = (1.0 - model.gr) + model.gr * giou.detach().clamp(0).type(tobj.dtype)  \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, the codes above transform the bbox prediction coordinates to yolov3 paper definition format  (tx, ty, tw, th), which are normalization results between 0 and 1.\r\nWhile  in your tutorial for training custom data model, the required labeled image txt file requires that the bbox coordinates should by normalized by the image width and height. \r\nI just wonder if the two normalization processes (yolo-paper  definition and  required coordinates label file definition) have the same results? If it is not, do we need to transform the label file? \r\nBecause I just want to train my own car classification model based on your project, I found that some relevant open-source datasets did not follow the coordinate definition required by your project. Some are x1y1x2y2 format. It is OK because I noticed that in your utils.py, you have a x1y1x2y2 to xywh function to transform the coordinate. I just wonder if the two normalization functions regarding to the (x, y) in your codes and the yolo definition are the same?
