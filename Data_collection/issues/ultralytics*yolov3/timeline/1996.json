👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about **handling inference results**. YOLOv5 🚀 [PyTorch Hub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36) models allow for simple model loading and inference in a pure python environment without using `detect.py`. \r\n\r\nTo load custom models:\r\n```python\r\nmodel = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', 'path/to/best.pt')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Simple Inference Example\r\n\r\nThis example loads a pretrained YOLOv5s model from PyTorch Hub as `model` and passes an image for inference. `'yolov5s'` is the YOLOv5 'small' model. For details on all available models please see the [README](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints). Custom models can also be loaded, including custom trained PyTorch models and their [exported](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/251) variants, i.e. ONNX, TensorRT, TensorFlow, OpenVINO YOLOv5 models.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# Model\r\nmodel = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # yolov5n - yolov5x6 official model\r\n#                                            'custom', 'path/to/best.pt')  # custom model\r\n\r\n# Images\r\nim = 'https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg'  # or file, Path, URL, PIL, OpenCV, numpy, list\r\n\r\n# Inference\r\nresults = model(im)\r\n\r\n# Results\r\nresults.print()  # or .show(), .save(), .crop(), .pandas(), etc.\r\nresults.xyxy[0]  # im predictions (tensor)\r\n\r\nresults.pandas().xyxy[0]  # im predictions
