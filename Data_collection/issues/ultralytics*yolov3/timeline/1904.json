👋 Hello! Thanks for asking about **feature visualization**. YOLOv5 🚀 features can be visualized through all stages of the model from input to output. To visualize features from a given source run `detect.py` with the `--visualize` flag:\r\n```bash\r\npython detect.py --weights yolov5s.pt --source data/images/bus.jpg --visualize\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) visualizing [bus.jpg](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/images/bus.jpg) features with YOLOv5s is shown below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov5\"><img src=\"https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg\" alt=\"Open In Kaggle\"></a>\r\n<img width=\"1811\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-08-30 at 16 44 04\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/131357928-663a120a-3133-4e1a-8995-c812bd732e8a.png\">\r\n\r\nAll stages are visualized by default, each with its own PNG showing the first 32 feature maps **output** from that stage. You can open any PNG for a closer look. For example the first 32 feature maps of the Focus() layer output are shown in

`utils/plots.py`:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/bb5ebc290e5d630a081d7cbc5a9725ed8cea0a24/utils/plots.py#L403-L427\r\n\r\nGood luck 🍀 and let us know if you have any other
