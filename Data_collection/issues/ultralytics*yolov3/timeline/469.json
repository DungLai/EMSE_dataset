Recently I have not tested the effect of removing it, but in the past I saw similar results short term with or without it. Darknet applies 0.0005 weight decay, but if they are smart they are only applying it to actual parameters and not the batchnorm2d layers, which brings me to a serious bug we have that is still unresolved:\r\n\r\n**We are applying weight_decay to all parameters, but it should NOT be applied to BatchNorm2d layers.** I don't know why PyTorch defaults to this, its an error on their part, leaving us to manually fix somehow.\r\n\r\nI think the proper way of enforcing this is creating two different parameter groups in the optimizer, so that one group applies to BatchNorm2d layers and the other group to all other parameters, but I have not found an easy way to implement this. \r\n\r\nThere are a few message boards on the topic, such as

I was thinking I should explain my workflow for testing changes. In the past I used small dataset (i.e. coco_32img.data) results to test and apply changes, but I realized the small datasets were not good indicators of performance on full coco. So then I started using 1 epoch of full COCO as my benchmark, trained at 320 img_size. But then again I realized that epoch 1 improvement does not correlate 100% with full training improvement.\r\n\r\nSo my current workflow is to test ideas on a small repeatable open-source dataset like coco_64img.data 320 img_size for 273 epochs, then if I see improvement there test it on 10% of the full coco training, 27 epochs. The results of some recent experiments using this benchmark are at https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/441#issuecomment-520229791.\r\n\r\nSo if we wanted to remove weight_decay from the repo (which may be a good idea), the change needs to display improvement on this 27-epoch benchmark.

I used the GroupNorm instead of BatchNorm, so if I used the BatchNorm, the result would get different results.\r\n\r\nAnd ... I have one question. It's some theoretical. Why do you think Weight Decay should not be applied to BatchNorm's parameters?

ah, so from a theoretical standpoint, weight decay should only be applied to trained parameters. It's purpose is to prevent overtraining by constantly and slowly dragging the weights to zero (i.e. resetting them to where they started). But the weights and biases in the BatchNorm layers, and probably in the GroupNorm layers also, are not trained, they are simply the running mean of the values that pass through them during each forward pass.\r\n\r\nSo it's impossible to 'overtrain' BatchNorm layers, since they are not trained at all. The result is that weight_decay is harming them every time it is applied, by dragging down the running means towards zero.\r\n\r\nBTW, I am training on the 27-epoch benchmark with the weight_decay removed. At epoch 18 now, and all metrics (P, R, mAP, F1) look better than default so far, so it looks like this is a good change! I will wait until the training finishes and then update #441 with the result, and commit the change if the final mAP improves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/524561549/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2581504707,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU4MTUwNDcwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2581504707","actor":{"login":"developer0hye","id":35001605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDAxNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35001605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye","html_url":"https://github.com/developer0hye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-24T15:58:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2581504708,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1ODE1MDQ3MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/events/2581504708","actor":{"login":"developer0hye","id":35001605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDAxNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35001605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye","html_url":"https://github.com/developer0hye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-24T15:58:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/comments/524599011","html_url":"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/469#issuecomment-524599011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/469","id":524599011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDU5OTAxMQ==","user":{"login":"developer0hye","id":35001605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDAxNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35001605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye","html_url":"https://github.com/developer0hye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/developer0hye/received_events","type":"User","site_adm

haha, well it is called weight_decay and not bias_decay, but it's common for people to  say 'weights' when they are really talking about 'parameters', so I don't know.\r\n\r\nI suppose the theory is that they drag parameters back to their starting points actively over time, so if the parameters don't have a good reason for being at their present values they will slowly drift back to zero, where they presumably started from. But at the same time it is fighting against the optimizer updates, especially if the gradient wants to move the parameters away from zero.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the same theory would hold true for biases as well as weights, since both are initialized about zero by default in pytorch.
