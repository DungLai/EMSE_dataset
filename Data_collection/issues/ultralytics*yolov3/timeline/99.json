@tamasbalassa yes I think the instabilities in the early batches that cause the loss to increase are related to a width and height issue. I reviewed this portion of the loss function and discovered a bug, which caused the bounding boxes to lose significant numerical precision when being converted between integer pixels and float values when expressed in grid units (i.e. 0-13). I fixed this in my latest commit today, and now notice improved results and better numerical stability.\r\n\r\nI think this may improve mAP significantly for COCO as well.

guide explains how to train your own **single-image dataset** with YOLOv3.\r\n\r\n## Before You Start\r\n\r\n1. Update (Python >= 3.7, PyTorch >= 1.3, etc.) and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies.\r\n2. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3`\r\n3. Download [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home): `bash yolov3/data/get_coco2017.sh`\r\n\r\n## Train On Custom Data\r\n\r\n**1. Label your data in Darknet format.** After using a tool like [Labelbox](https://labelbox.com/) to label your images, you'll need to export your data to darknet format. Your data should follow the example created by `get_coco2017.sh`, with images and labels in separate parallel folders, and one label file per image (if no objects in image, no label file is required). The label file specifications are:\r\n- One row per object\r\n- Each row is `class x_center y_center width height` format.\r\n- Box coordinates must be in **normalized xywh** format (from 0 - 1). If your boxes are in pixels, divide `x_center` and `width` by image width, and `y_center` and `height` by image height.\r\n- Class numbers are zero-indexed (start from 0).\r\n\r\nEach image's label file must be locatable by simply replacing `/images/*.jpg` with `/labels/*.txt` in its pathname. An example image and label pair would be:\r\n```bash\r\n../coco/images/train2017/000000109622.jpg  # image\r\n../coco/labels/train2017/000000109622.txt  # label\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example label file with 4 persons (all class `0`):  \r\n<img width=\"474\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-02-20 at 17 05 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/53105599-ba7dff80-3531-11e9-8860-10a48872b043.png\">\r\n\r\n**2. Create train and test `*.txt` files.** Here we create `data/coco_1img.txt`, which contains 1 image from the coco 2014 trainval dataset. We will use this small dataset for both training and testing. Each row contains a path to an image, and remember one label must also exist in a corresponding `/labels` folder for each image that has targets.  \r\n<img width=\"590\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-07 at 13 38 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/55682967-853f3c80-593a-11e9-8f3c-66340df01966.png\">\r\n\r\n**3. Create new `*.names` file** listing the class names in our dataset. Here we use the existing `data/coco.names` file. Classes are **zero indexed**, so `person` is class `0`, `bicycle` is class `1`, etc.  \r\n<img width=\"355\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-06 at 14 06 34\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/55669238-3b405300-5875-11e9-9b93-7363c86def6a.png\">\r\n\r\n**4. Update `data/coco.data`** lines 2 and 3 to point to our new text file for training and validation (in your own data you would likely want to use separate train and test sets). Also update line 1 to our new class count, if not 80, and lastly update line 4 to point to our new `*.names` file, if you created one.  Save the modified file as `data/coco_1img.data`.\r\n<img width=\"463\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-07 at 13 38 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/55682970-8d977780-593a-11e9-87ef-76650899e7fd.png\">\r\n\r\n**5. Update `*.cfg` file** (optional). Each YOLO layer has 255 outputs: 85 outputs per anchor [4 box coordinates + 1 object confidence + 80 class confidences], times 3 anchors. If you use fewer classes, reduce filters to `filters=[4 + 1 + n] * 3`, where `n` is your class count. This modification should be made to the layer preceding each of the 3 YOLO layers. Also modify `classes=80` to `classes=n` in each YOLO layer, where `n` is your class count.  \r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-02-21 at 19 40 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/66830924-e03f9500-ef56-11e9-9d09-97f9921cab39.png\">\r\n\r\n**6. (OPTIONAL) Update hyperparameters** such as LR, LR scheduler, optimizer, augmentation settings, multi_scale settings, etc in `train.py` for your particular task. We recommend you start with all-default settings first updating anything.\r\n\r\n**7. Train.** Run `python3 train.py --data data/coco_1img.data` to train using your custom data. If you created a custom `*.cfg` file as well, specify it using `--cfg cfg/my_new_file.cfg`.\r\n\r\n## Visualize Results\r\n\r\nRun `from utils import utils; utils.plot_results()` to see your training losses and performance metrics vs epoch. If you don't see acceptable performance, try [hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/392) and re-training. Multiple `results.txt` files are overlaid automatically to compare performance. \r\n\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/69303421-d05c4600-0bd1-11ea-843b-32ccb651f7b1.png)\r\n\r\nEvaluate your trained model: Copy `COCO_val2014_000000581886.jpg` to `data/samples` folder and run `python3 detect.py --weights weights/last.pt`\r\n\r\n![coco_val2014_000000581886](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/52953723-929f6800-3388-11e9-9a09-8d0bbb76e2af.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Reproduce Our Results\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this tutorial, simply run the following code. This trains all the various [tutorials](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki), saves each results*.txt file separately, and plots them together as `results.png`. It all takes less than 30 minutes on a 2080Ti. \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3\r\npython3 -c \"from yolov3.utils.google_utils import gdrive_download; gdrive_download('1h0Id-7GUyuAmyc9Pwo2c3IZ17uExPvOA','coco2017demos.zip')\"  # datasets (20 Mb)\r\ncd yolov3\r\npython3 train.py --data coco64.data --batch 16 --accum 1 --epochs 300 --nosave --cache --weights '' --name from_scratch\r\npython3 train.py --data coco64.data --batch 16 --accum 1 --epochs 300 --nosave --cache --weights yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt --name from_yolov3-spp-ultralytics\r\npython3 train.py --data coco64.data --batch 16 --accum 1 --epochs 300 --nosave --cache --weights darknet53.conv.74 --name from_darknet53.conv.74\r\npython3 train.py --data coco1.data --batch 1 --accum 1 --epochs 300 --nosave --cache --weights darknet53.conv.74 --name 1img\r\npython3 train.py --data coco1cls.data --batch 16 --accum 1 --epochs 300 --nosave --cache --weights darknet53.conv.74 --cfg yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --name 1cls\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Reproduce Our Environment\r\n\r\nTo access an up-to-date working environment (with all dependencies including CUDA/CUDNN, Python and PyTorch preinstalled), consider a:\r\n\r\n- **GCP** Deep Learning VM with $300 free credit offer: See our [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) \r\n- **Google Colab Notebook** with 12 hours of free GPU time: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw)\r\n- **Docker Image** from https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3.
