The only thing I changed is loading image because my image is gray scale and cv2 . Imread cut the channel and doesnâ€™t bring it back. So I stacked my images to get 3 channels and convert them from 16 uint to 8 . If you have a suggestion on loading grayscale images without cutting of the channel please let me know. Because I got many error regarding dimension of the image when trying to load in with cv2 . Imread. I lost my connection to my previous message on nan loss so I put my question here.
