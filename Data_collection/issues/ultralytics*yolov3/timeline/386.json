":"Thanks for the reply @glenn-jocher .I am running the latest version of this repo with my own dataset which contains 704 training images of dimension 800 * 448.I have modified my config files and .data files accordingly.That should not be a problem because transfer learning is running seamlessly without any problem.Here are my terminal outputs-\r\n\r\nRunning `python3 train.py --img-size 800 --epochs 1000 --cfg cfg/waste_smaller.cfg --data waste_data/waste_smaller_data.data --rect` produces following output (I have added print statement at major transition points.The statement after loss.backward() is never executed.)-\r\n![terminal output of train.py](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9949388/62234140-af37d580-b3e7-11e9-9190-de84b9bf5646.png)\r\n\r\nThe script is stuck indefinitely.Re sshing into the instance is only option to unfreeze it.\r\n\r\nHere is my `nvidia-smi` output

a look at fairly recent issue in pytorch https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/20355\r\n\r\nAlso thanks for your advice of using V100.I used it,and can confirm it is indeed multi-gpu
