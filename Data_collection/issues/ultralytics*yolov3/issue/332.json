Let's say 1056x608 resolution is close to 1080p aspect ratio. I want to train a network from scratch with that resolution. I have a few questions around that:\r\n1) Does this repo support training with network sizes that are not square? (Rectangular network size?)\r\n2) If so, what is img_size in the code? Is it always a square image fed to the network in the inference step?\r\n3) Is so called \"rectangular training\" support coming in v7 related to training non-square network sizes, or is it just an optimization around rectangular images in dataset during training?\r\n4) If I change number of filters of convolutional layers in cfg file, will this repo correctly initialize weights? It looks like it always initializes with darknet's already trained weights file.\r\nBest","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
