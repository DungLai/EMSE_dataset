If so, do you leave them there to be consistent with the Darknet `.cfg` files?\r\n2) From the definition of the `Darknet`class, it seems like the input size is fixed at 416 x 416. Why is this not parsed from the `.cfg` file? \r\n3) How many images are effectively processed per batch when *mosaic* loading is enabled? If I understand the code correctly, you take one image from the batch and assemble it with 3 random other images from the dataset? Does this mean, the network \"sees\" every image from the dataset approximately 4 times per epoch? \r\n4) Why do you attach `arc` and `hyp` to `model`? I don't see them used anywhere in the code.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/585064f300fa2d4bb80667927adc12caf1dbcc30/train.py#L202-L203\r\n**Edit**: I just saw, that these variables are used in some functions in `utils/utils.py`.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help.","closed_by":{"login":"MauroPfister","id":48028499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDI4NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48028499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister","html_url":"https://github.com/MauroPfister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MauroPfister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/918/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
