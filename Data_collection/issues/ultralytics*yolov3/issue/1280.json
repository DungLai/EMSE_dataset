I would like to draw precision and recall curve. I only have 1 label in my dataset. However, I encountered this error\r\n```\r\ns = [len(unique_classes), tp.shape[1]] #number class, number iou thresholds (i.e. 10 for mAP0.5...0.95)\r\nIndexError: tuple index out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to print out `unique_classes` and `tp`. It looks out like this.\r\n` unique_classes = [0.]`\r\n `tp = [1. 0. 0. ... 0. 1. 0.]`\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.
