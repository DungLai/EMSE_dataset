That should mean inference time is 5.47s/78 images which is about 70 milliseconds for one image. However, it seems like inference speed is not calculated that way.  What is the inference speed calculating? \r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nval: Scanning '/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov3/allData/labels/val.cache' images and labels... 78 found, 0 missing, 0 empty, 0 corrupted: 100% 78/78 [00:00<00:00, 703560.67it/s]\r\n               Class      Images      Labels           P           R      mAP@.5  mAP@.5:.95: 100% 7/7 [00:38<00:00,  5.47s/it]\r\n                 all          78         101       0.629       0.515       0.501       0.222\r\nSpeed: 4.6/1.5/6.1 ms inference/NMS/total per 512x512 image at batch-size 12","closed_by":{"login":"rrreeeeeeee","id":58054213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDU0MjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58054213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee","html_url":"https://github.com/rrreeeeeeee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrreeeeeeee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
