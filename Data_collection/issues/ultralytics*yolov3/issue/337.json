My dataset is extremely imbalanced, e.g. one class has over 2000 images, but some classes may only have 40 images, so I used `labels_to_image_weights` and `labels_to_class_weights`.  The code is downloaded in 2019.06.18. \r\n\r\nAfter training about 107 epochs, the metrics like precision and recall seem to increase, but test loss increases (see below figure). Should I just keep running the code or stop it and modify some parameters? Looking forward to your reply, thx!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13477956/59734600-ae5a4280-9284-11e9-8961-07b1924c6324.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
