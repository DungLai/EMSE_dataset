For yolov5, the learning performance improved slightly, while for yolov3, there was a drastic increase in MaP of about 15%. Can someone explain what causes such variation in performance and why the models respond so differently to the increase in image size? Thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"karen-gishyan","id":52350350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzUwMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52350350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan","html_url":"https://github.com/karen-gishyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karen-gishyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
