Why is it 6? It sets the labels[:, 1:] = [class, x,y,w,h] but the labe[:, 0] index is left zero. In build_targets function called in the compute_loss function I found that the target is supposed to be [image, class, x, y, w, h]. However, I can not find any point in the code where this image is added to the target. Did I miss anything or why is this zero image inside the label? Does it have any purpose? \r\n\r\nI hope you can help me with my confusion. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"KochPJ","id":39192694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTkyNjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39192694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ","html_url":"https://github.com/KochPJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KochPJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
