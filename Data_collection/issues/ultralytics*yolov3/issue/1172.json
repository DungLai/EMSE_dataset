I met this problem after I trained on my own dataset and convert the model to ONNX. While I am running the ONNX model on a normal input image, I got the output like this:\r\n```\r\nboxes:\r\n[0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n[0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n[0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n...\r\n```\r\nthe classes output seems normal just between 0 and 1.\r\nthis is the ONNX model:\r\n<img width=\"1598\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-14 at 12 54 44 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10252812/81841796-8dc26780-957d-11ea-9f6a-62281aedb318.png\">\r\nwhich I think should be correct.\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n**REQUIRED**: Code to reproduce your issue below\r\nFirst, I set `ONNX_EXPORT = True` in [model.py])(https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/b2fcfc573e5418c0b2ef0c0357bf51bc5cb027b6/models.py#L5)\r\nThen, due to the machine env problem, I have to use `opset_version=9` in [detect.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/b2fcfc573e5418c0b2ef0c0357bf51bc5cb027b6/detect.py#L47)\r\nAfter this I convert the model to onnx:\r\n```\r\npython detect.py --cfg yolov3-spp.cfg \\\r\n    --names data/mydataset.names \\\r\n    --weights weights/best.pt \\\r\n    --source data/samples \\\r\n    --conf-thres 0.3 \\\r\n    --iou-thres 0.6\r\n```\r\nI will receive a warning during conversion:\r\n```\r\nyolov3/utils/layers.py:60: TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python boolean might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!\r\n  if nx == na:  # same shape\r\n```\r\nwhich I think is related to https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/b2fcfc573e5418c0b2ef0c0357bf51bc5cb027b6/utils/layers.py#L60\r\nBut I am not sure whether this warning will cause this issue.\r\n\r\nAfter then I run the inference through onnxruntime. and got a normal `classes` output and a all zero output `boxes`.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nExpected behavior the boxes definitely not all zeros.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n - OS: [Ubuntu 1604]\r\n - GPU [V100]\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
