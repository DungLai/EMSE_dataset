Below are the label number for train and val sets: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73492511/153254748-701c25dc-487d-4bca-9e22-704fe3773976.png)\r\n\r\nThe hyperparamteres are default, the training is done on 416 img size, 16 batch value, 68 epochs (seen as recommended in another issue), using multi-scale and not freezing any layer. \r\nThe problem is that the map@.5 jumps very quickly to ~0.3 and then increases a little bit towards 0.36-0.37. This behavior was encountered for multiple runs, one with a smaller train dataset, one with different batch value, one without multiscale. \r\nBelow are the train/val results. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73492511/153255932-b9166a51-3552-41b0-9442-cfcfee8cbd38.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, the concerning thing in the photo above is the val/obj_loss which i don't really know how to interpret or why it happens usually, given the fact that the other curves look as expected. \r\n\r\nCould you see a possible issue/solution with/for the things mentioned? Would a higher mAP value be possible having the mentioned label numbers for train and val datasets (and considering the fact that the images are well chosen)? \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
