I would appreciate some hints on how to fine tune the the yolov3 network and its hyperparameters to be able detecting long, but very thin defects. \r\n\r\nI have 4k x 3k images that I resized to 1.6k x 1.2k and than cutted to 608x608, 416x416 and 256x256 tiles containing the cracks. The cracks are quite visible with human eye. I have a set of 1000 real images and 4000 artificial images (cracks generated using tent map and some augmentation)\r\n\r\nI am still after 200 epochs on mAP=0 on yolov3-tiny.cfg and yolov3-spp.cfg. I am guessing that the architecture needs to be reconfigured slightly to be able detecting long, but couple of pixels wide defect.\r\n\r\nI would very appreciate any recommendation.","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
