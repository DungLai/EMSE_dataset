The images have different sizes and are all in RGB (png) but with no colours. There is only one class (signature).\r\n\r\nMy dataset looks like this:\r\n\r\n**Train dataset** \r\nFiles with signature (positives): 813 files\r\nFiles without signature(negatives): 162 files\r\n\r\n**Validation dataset**\r\nFiles with signature (positives): 203 files\r\nFiles without signature (negatives): 40 files\r\n\r\nI trained with the yolo3.cfg configuration, updating the _classes_ to 1 and the _filters_ to 18 (in the layers before the yolo layers).\r\n\r\nThe training is complete, but I'm not able to detect anything.\r\n\r\nThe results graphs look like this (Width/Height, Confidence, Classification look odd):\r\n\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12388054/62324431-d7f5c300-b4ec-11e9-8404-003d293d65af.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the final epoch looks like this:\r\n```\r\nEpoch   gpu_mem   GIoU/xy        wh       obj       cls     total   targets  img_size\r\n99/99        0G     0.153         0    0.0206  0.000374     0.174        18       416\r\n                    Class    Images   Targets         P         R       mAP        F1\r\n                      all       243       291     0.626      0.88     0.772     0.731\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure what I am doing wrong.
