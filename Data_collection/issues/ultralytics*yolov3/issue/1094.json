I am using it for my custom datasets which have a lot of common objects with COCO dataset. I have used yolov3-spp weights trained on COCO dataset and load it without the layers one before each yolo layer. That is, I load the weights of all the layers except 88, 100 and 112. \r\n\r\nI just want to ask you is this the right approach for this method? \r\n\r\nIf it is, maybe an argument can be added to train.py code for loading weights except these layers.\r\n\r\nThank you for response.","closed_by":{"login":"kaanakan","id":34209020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjA5MDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34209020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan","html_url":"https://github.com/kaanakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanakan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1094/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
