I'm training my custom dataset (bdd100k) on **Google Colab**. \r\n\r\nI found that every time I connect to a remote machine, the â€˜caching labels' procedure is always very time consuming during the first training (6000 labels per hour). And the cache speed it's OK in the subsequent training. \r\nAs you know, Google Colab will lose connection and remove RAM after 12 hours' running, and after that I need to cache the labels again... so it's really annoying for me.\r\n\r\n![cap3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59131624/81361110-17061400-9110-11ea-8372-1e6fd77b119a.JPG)\r\n\r\nHere are my questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do you have any advice for me to avoid or shorten the caching time?\r\n\r\n2. Is it ok to remove the caching procedure ? and how?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"adin-pro","id":59131624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMxNjI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59131624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro","html_url":"https://github.com/adin-pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adin-pro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
