We set the initial and final LRs as hyperparameters `hyp['lr0']` and `hyp['lrf']`, where the final LR `= lr0 * (10 ** lrf)` . For example, if the initial LR is 0.001 and the final LR is 100 times (1e-2) smaller, `hyp['lrf']=0.001` and `hyp['lrf']=-2`. This plot shows two of the available PyTorch LR schedulers, with the MultiStepLR scheduler following the original darknet implementation (at `batch_size=64` on COCO).

You may want to set your own scheduler according to your specific custom dataset and training requirements, and also adjust it's hyperparameters accordingly.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/bd2378fad1578e7d7722ad846458ad7a2bb43442/train.py#L102-L109","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
