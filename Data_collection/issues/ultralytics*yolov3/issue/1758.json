https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1575\r\n\r\nCurrently Kaggle has changed its kernel notebook interface. Maybe this error is because of it.  Colab kernel works fine. \r\n\r\nOne thing to add, when I set wandb login with kaggle notebook, it doesn't show up input box for pasting wandb API credential keys. Any idea to correct this? \r\n\r\n![no_input_box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55954384/117917902-ff65fa80-b324-11eb-9abc-1e7a29f8d759.png)\r\n\r\nBest regards.
