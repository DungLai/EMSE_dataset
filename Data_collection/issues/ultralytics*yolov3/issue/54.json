I had two questions, however, about the matching step in build_targets -- where you compute which anchor box corresponds to each ground truth box.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be computing IoU using only the width and height of each anchor box against each target. Darknet doesn't appear to do this -- if I'm reading the implementation correctly, it iterates through the grid cells and computes the IoU using the X and Y of each cell. Is there a reason you compute IoU using width and height only? Optimization?\r\n\r\nAlso during this step, the ignore_threshold is set to 0.5 in the Darknet paper, and 0.7 in the Darknet implementation, while you seem to be using 0.1 in build_targets. Is there a reason for that?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"radvani","id":14915051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE1MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14915051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani","html_url":"https://github.com/radvani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radvani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
