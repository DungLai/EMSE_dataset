My Question is related to custom object detection where I have trained a single class using  \"yolov3-spp-ultralytics\". I have followed the training wiki which is uploaded on this repository . After training the model ,it is giving me good detection result on the trained object but it is detecting some false object which are not similar to trained objects. The training process give me best weights at 10 epoches (which has map 0.86) and the best weights are not improved till 150 epochs .I have use single class with 5000 images.\r\nAccuracy is good but it giving some false detection\r\n I have used following training parameters\r\n\r\nhyp = {'giou': 1.00,  # giou loss gain\r\n       'cls': 37.4,  # cls loss gain\r\n       'cls_pw': 1.0,  # cls BCELoss positive_weight\r\n       'obj': 64.3,  # obj loss gain (*=img_size/320 if img_size != 320)\r\n       'obj_pw': 1.0,  # obj BCELoss positive_weight\r\n       'iou_t': 0.225,  # iou training threshold\r\n       'lr0': 0.001,  # initial learning rate (SGD=5E-3, Adam=5E-4)\r\n       'lrf': -4.,  # final LambdaLR learning rate = lr0 * (10 ** lrf)\r\n       'momentum': 0.937,  # SGD momentum\r\n       'weight_decay': 0.000484,  # optimizer weight decay\r\n       'fl_gamma': 0.0,  # focal loss gamma (efficientDet default is gamma=1.5)\r\n       'hsv_h': 0.0138,  # image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)\r\n       'hsv_s': 0.678,  # image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction)\r\n       'hsv_v': 0.36,  # image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction)\r\n       'degrees': 1.98 * 0,  # image rotation (+/- deg)\r\n       'translate': 0.05 * 0,  # image translation (+/- fraction)\r\n       'scale': 0.05 * 0,  # image scale (+/- gain)\r\n       'shear': 0.641 * 0}  # image shear (+/- deg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan anobody help me why model giving some false detection and how it can be removed .Thanks  ","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
