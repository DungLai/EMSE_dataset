The predictions outputted while running test.py are good. However, while running detect.py, the predictions are very poor.

Such cases have been observed in multiple outputs from detect.py\r\n\r\nThe image size is 416 and the model has been trained on 400 epochs. Reiterating on the issue, the outputs from test.py are pretty stable while the outputs from detect.py are really poor.\r\n\r\nKindly advice on the potential changes to be done to fix the issue.
