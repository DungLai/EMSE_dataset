As I understand, the output of conf of \"det\" is the result of obj.conf * cls.conf, and this is done in the function: non_max_suppression in utils.py. But I can't figure out correct way to output them from non_max_suppression. Can anyone helps? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"www7890","id":27401290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAxMjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27401290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890","html_url":"https://github.com/www7890","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/www7890/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
