Which made me think that maybe I've misunderstood how `shapes` work here...\r\n\r\nCould you please help me in understanding what I'm doing wrong? It seemed to me that `shapes[si][0]` contains the (height, width) of the original image, thus I was comparing every bounding box in `box` against it, while checking for negative coordinates.","closed_by":{"login":"tjiagoM","id":7031523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzE1MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7031523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM","html_url":"https://github.com/tjiagoM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjiagoM/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
