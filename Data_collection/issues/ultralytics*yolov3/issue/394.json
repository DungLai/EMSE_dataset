I figured it might be helpful to open a new issue on this topic since it's currently not implemented. I also have questions regarding this feature.\r\n\r\nDoes this feature mean that predictions that have IoUs > 0.7 will have a lesser impact on compute_loss, so their losses will be scaled downwards or not considered altogether? Or does it have something to do with the anchors themselves? I can't seem to find this section of code in the original darknet repo, can somebody please direct me towards it? Thanks.
