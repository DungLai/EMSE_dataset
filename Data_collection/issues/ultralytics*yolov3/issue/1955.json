I have some questions about the label or GT for YOLOV3.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the code in loss.py (build_targets and compute loss).\r\n\r\nMy understanding is as follows:\r\n\r\nOne GT from label file (annotation txt file) would be converted to be targets in 3 different prediction layers. \r\nThen it would be filtered by the ratio which is provided by self.hyp['anchor_t'].\r\nSo there might be a case that one GT to be converted as a target in different anchors from different layers.\r\nWhen calculating loss, all these targets would be counted.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, how the model will be learned to predict the correct size?(I know this already has been approved to be True, I just dont understand )\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nZD\r\n\n\n### Additional\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
