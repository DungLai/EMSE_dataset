I labeled persons and hats with Labelbox, like this:\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13971749/72119593-eabfce00-338f-11ea-9eea-4ab239f17f5b.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter then I extracted the cell phone pics and labels from COCO and combined them with my own pics & labels together. I tried to train them with darknet53.conv.74 with default settings, but it raises a warning saying \"non-finite loss, ending training tensor\". So I did a bit research and lowered giou to 1 and lr0 to 0.00001. The model was trained all good, but it failed to detect cell phones in my tests (I tried yolov3.weights, and it has no trouble with it), also the person & hat detection was not satisfying as before (when I trained person & hat with darknet53.conv.74).\r\n\r\nDetection from person & hat model I trained with darknet53.conv.74, it was good:\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13971749/72120225-38d5d100-3392-11ea-9830-04653b48f450.jpg)\r\n\r\nDetection from yolov3.weights that only displays labels of cell phone, it was good:\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13971749/72120300-7a667c00-3392-11ea-87af-fe358721879b.jpg)\r\n\r\nDetection from person & hat, combined with cell phone class in COCO, trained with darknet53.conv.74 and giou set to 1 and lr0 set to 0.00001, it was bad:\r\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13971749/72120549-463f8b00-3393-11ea-83fa-acdf67983811.jpg)\r\n\r\nWonder what I should do now.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
