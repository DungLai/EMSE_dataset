When I looked at the exported model using Netron I got this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22814015/56900154-0f3b7a80-6a8d-11e9-9e83-71cb2938f974.png)\r\n\r\nI expected only 3 outputs from the model:\r\n\r\n21x13x13\r\n21x26x26\r\n21x52x52\r\n\r\nI understand then becoming 1x3x13x13x7/1x3x26x26x7/1x3x52x52x7,, but what's this fourth output 1x10647x7?\r\nI used this repo as basis for my swift code: [YOLOv3-CoreML](https://github.com/Ma-Dan/YOLOv3-CoreML) (I never coded in swift before so this repo really helped :) ) and that was the format it's example used. Since in theory they are both Yolov3/Darknet the output should be the same, right?\r\nAny help / hints on this would be great :)\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
