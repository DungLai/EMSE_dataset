Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\nWe are collecting some inference performance data on different kinds of devices for YOLOv3 now, but we cannot find any data on T4. Your repo is an amazing project and you provide many details on training. So we wonder if you could share the data with us. \r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nAdd inference performance data on T4 for YOLOv3 different resolutions in ReadMe, such as 416*416, 320*320, 608*608.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered, if any. -->\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
