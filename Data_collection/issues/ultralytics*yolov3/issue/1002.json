I know these are minor details, but I want to make sure, I don't misunderstand something.\r\n\r\n1) For the max-pooling layers in yolov3-tiny you seem to pad only on the right and bottom. Why so?\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/27c7334e8176d1b0de0aab9e8616c48ba21903f8/models.py#L49-L50\r\n\r\n2) The function `create_grids()` seems to be only used in the class `YOLOLayer`. Why is it not a method of that class? \r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/27c7334e8176d1b0de0aab9e8616c48ba21903f8/models.py#L276\r\n\r\nThanks =) ","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
