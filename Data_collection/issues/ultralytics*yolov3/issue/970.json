It is unofficial but it has reproduced results from the paper. This implementation gives the results of the paper (e.g. for efficientnet-D4) of mAP 0.48 on the coco2017 subset. It also compares the tables against YoloV3 in the first table in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf), the 33 mAP aforementioned.\r\n\r\n But if I evaluate on **your** coco2017, I get much higher results (0.407 mAP with Yolov3).\r\n\r\nSo to summarize: \r\n- Is coco2014 actually coco2017 from the paper?\r\n- Is this coco2017 different than other repositories? Does the image list & label list differ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
