On each channels I have different physical informations (not the RGB channels of a classic image). I'm trying to adapt this repo, but it seems that the keyword [channels] in the .cfg file do not works properly. Or I am doing something wrong, but what?\r\n\r\n(and btw great repo! well written and well benchmarked!)\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. set `[channels] = 4` in the .cfg\r\n2. since I don't need HSV augmentation, change hyper in train.py to `hsv_h: 0.00; hsv_s: 1.0, hsv_v: 1.0`\r\n3.
