Thank you!**\r\n@Samjith888 your command automatically loads the `ultralytics49.pt` backbone, which requires `yolov3-spp.cfg`. You must remove the backbone by using `--weights ''`, or specify a weights-cfg combination that is compatible.\r\n\r\nThis error is caused by a user supplying incompatible `--weights` and `--cfg` arguments. To solve this you must specify no weights (i.e. random initialization of the model) using `--weights ''` and any `--cfg`, or use a `--cfg` that is compatible with your `--weights`. If none are specified, the defaults are `--weights ultralytics49.pt` and `--cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg`.\r\n\r\nCompatible `--weights --cfg` combinations:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3.weights --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights yolov3-spp.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights ultralytics49.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\npython3 train.py --weights ultralytics68.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To train from scratch** (randomly initialized weights), use:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --weights '' --cfg cfg/*.cfg  # any cfg will work here\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ultralytics49.pt` is currently the highest performing YOLOv3 model (trained from scratch using this repo) available at the default `img-size` of 416 (see https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310), which is the reason it is used as the default backbone.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @glenn-jocher in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/657#issuecomment-558334674_","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
