I update the cfg accordingly with the new anchors. The GIoU (~7) and Objectness (~4) loss both seem to remain approximately fixed and the P, R, mPA, F1 are all zero after 100 epochs of training. What am I missing here? my actual image size is 1536x2048. for training because I only have two 1080's so I use the img_size of 416. just to be sure I gave image size of (416,416) in the kmeans_anchors with similar outcome. I also already tried couple of learning rates starting from 0.0001 to 0.001with no improvements. With the original anchors, I could see the total training loss decrease about half the start point (11) and settle around (5.5) and not move even after 330 epochs. although the P,R,mPA, F1 are all above 0.8. but still can't figure why the convergence is stuck half way! I was hoping custom anchors would help but not getting anywhere.. any idea on what I can do?
