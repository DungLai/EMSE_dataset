However, I found a problem. After training the same network multiple times, the final results were very different.\r\n\r\nfirst run:\r\n```\r\n               Class    Images   Targets         P         R   mAP@0.5        F1: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1194/1194 [00:47<00:00, 25.39it/s]\r\n                 all  2.39e+03  2.51e+03     0.938     0.921     0.913      0.93\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nsecond run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n               Class    Images   Targets         P         R   mAP@0.5        F1: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1194/1194 [00:48<00:00, 24.74it/s]\r\n                 all  2.39e+03  2.51e+03     0.936     0.919     0.904     0.927\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above two experiments are the same data, the same network, without changing any parameters.\r\n\r\nThis really confuses me. If each experiment cannot be reproduced, it is difficult to know whether the map promotion is caused by random factors or the network structure.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the init_seeds method has been used in the code. But why the two training results are inconsistent? Do you have any suggestions for this?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pprp","id":29230784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjMwNzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29230784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp","html_url":"https://github.com/pprp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pprp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
