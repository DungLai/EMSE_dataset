I checked the images/annotations to make sure the were ok with Yolo_Mark (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark) and they are correct. The file darknet53.conv.74 is on the weights subfolder so it should have been used to initialize the network.\r\n    I started training on Darknet with the same dataset and after one epoch my mAP is at 16.91 with a loss of 1.86. On darknet I used these options:\r\n\r\nbatch=64\r\nsubdivisions=8\r\nwidth=416\r\nheight=416\r\nlearning_rate=0.0001\r\n\r\n    I was using the latest version when I run this test yesterday.\r\n    Any hints?\r\n    Thanks!\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry this should been a question not a bug.
