I'm trying to add channel-wise attention (SE block) into yolov3, so I change every Residual block. I trained from scratch but the mAP isn't satisfying.\r\nIs there any way I can try to load some layer's weights which match my model? \r\nI modify the code in train.py but failed. Here's my code:\r\n\r\n`model_dict = model.state_dict()`\r\n`chkpt['model'] = {k: v for k, v in chkpt['model'].items() if k in model_dict}`\r\n`model_dict.update(chkpt['model'])`\r\n`model.load_state_dict(model_dict)`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41316711/81905691-a3747300-95f7-11ea-8637-363601d36e8d.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
