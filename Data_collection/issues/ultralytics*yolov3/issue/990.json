As far as I know, the way mAP compute for VOC is different from COCO: only compute mAP under 0.5 iouThreshold instead of 0.5~0.95 for COCO. I check your `util.py` and found `compute_ap` and `ap_per_class` functions. But I don't know how to modify your code for my purpose. Could you plz help me? Thank you.","closed_by":{"login":"Ringhu","id":47172283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTcyMjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47172283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ringhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ringhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
