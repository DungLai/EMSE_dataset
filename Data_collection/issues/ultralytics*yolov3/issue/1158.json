And I wanted to measure the mAP, but separately for every class. @glenn-jocher as you showed in the 'Train Custom Data' tutorial, I modified the yolov3-spp.cfg to train on 5 classes. For the validation, I tried to use the yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg. Also created a .names file with only 1 class name inside for testing. But this is what I get.\r\n![k√©p](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9340045/81560858-855a0900-9392-11ea-9150-47bc75d45e9f.png)\r\n\r\n I guess that shape error is coming somehow from the weights, as I was training on 5 classes, and trying to test on 1 class. Also tried to convert best.pt into backbone, but got the same error. So my question is, is there any way to run test.py for 1 class in this case? This 'error' is there for inference testing too.","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
