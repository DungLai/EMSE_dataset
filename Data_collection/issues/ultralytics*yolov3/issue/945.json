I'd like to know your idea or intuition for my next action.\r\n\r\nWhen I use cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg and yolov3-spp.weights downloaded in AlexeyAB's YOLO repository, my c# program can output the results of object detection properly.\r\nHowever, when I use cfg/yolo3-spp.cfg and yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt for my c# project using Alturos.Yolo, the model always outputs \"no object\" in the video though the model can be loaded.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n1. open vs 2019, make c# package, install Alturos.Yolo from Nuget package manager \r\n2. load yolov3-spp.weight with cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg and see result (working good)\r\n3. load yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt with cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg and see result (working bad)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n3. load yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt with cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg and see result (working **bad**)\r\n->\r\n3. load yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt with cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg and see result (working **good**)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nWindows 10, vs 2019, Alturos.Yolo\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n-","closed_by":{"login":"Jungmo","id":15346785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ2Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15346785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo","html_url":"https://github.com/Jungmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jungmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/945/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
