So, I decided to split it into multiple parts and run training procedure sequentially with each part. On the second pass, I found that **mAP** and **F1** dropped significantly (mAP ~ 0.9 -> 0.008). When I started to figure out what was going on, I discovered that the labels are not cached again and I need to delete them like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!rm -f data/my_custom_dataset/training/labels.npy\r\n!rm -f data/my_custom_dataset/validation/labels.npy\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a small custom dataset and split it into multiple parts, then train model sequentially with each part.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python train.py ... --data data/my_custom_dataset/part1.data --epochs 75 ...\r\n$ python train.py ... --data data/my_custom_dataset/part2.data --epochs 150 --weights weights/best.pt ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nInvalidate labels cache for subsequent runs. \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nGoogle Colab free tier.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1554/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
