Then I can achieve mAP values of 99.5 +% and 96% + respectively on AlexeyAB DarkNet, but using your project can only reach mAP values of 80% + and 70% +, respectively. I also use GIOU Loss in the AlexeyAB code, and all use the default parameters in your project. In addition, I use YOLOV3-Tiny network. I wonder if there might be some problems with this code?","closed_by":{"login":"BBuf","id":35585791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTg1Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35585791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf","html_url":"https://github.com/BBuf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
