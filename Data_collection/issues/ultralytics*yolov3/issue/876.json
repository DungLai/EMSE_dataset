I made some scripts that extract all the alarmed frames from the recorded videos and analyze their content in search of people. When a person is identified I receive a message on Telegram. The system is working quite well but I have a problem with a black cat who, every time he passes in front of one of my cameras, is detected as a person. It is still not clear to me how the models work. Is there anyone who can give me some advice on how to eliminate false positives of this type?\r\n\r\nThis is the command I use:\r\n python3 detect.py --cfg cfg / yolov3-spp.cfg --weights weights / yolov3-spp.weights --classes 0 --conf-thres 0.70 --img-size=608 --source $TEMP_RAM \"diolupo2\" --output $TEMP_RAM \"diolupo3\"> $ANAL_LOG\r\n\r\n![467](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464266-41588a00-5987-11ea-8185-ae1cdf3e890f.jpg)\r\n![471](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464271-41f12080-5987-11ea-98e7-c1d77ba5a042.jpg)\r\n![475](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464272-4289b700-5987-11ea-90c5-8f1757cdba40.jpg)\r\n![458](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464275-4289b700-5987-11ea-9b7c-d1267c680b32.jpg)\r\n![471_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464724-e96e5300-5987-11ea-8b88-f8347fc0a7b8.jpg)\r\n![475_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464726-ea9f8000-5987-11ea-9b36-96ef0a3001e6.jpg)\r\n![458_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464727-ea9f8000-5987-11ea-8add-bef407a189c6.jpg)\r\n![467_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554427/75464730-eb381680-5987-11ea-95b9-b023be4d82b9.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
