But when it runs to `compute_loss`, the `build_targets` cannot find `ng` in YoloLayer. It only occurs in multi_gpus. [I also check \"model.module.module_list\", the `ng` just disappear, don't know why.]\r\n\r\nBTW, I try to use multi_gpus but not distributed training, so I replace the `DistributedDataParallel` to `DataParallel`, not sure if this change makes the error.\r\n\r\nNeed help.
