Upon prediction I received to arrays of shape:\r\n```\r\n(3780, 1)\r\n(3780, 4)\r\n```\r\nI assumed the first one to be `scores` and the second one to be `boxes`. To my surprise, however, when predicting the known data (yet again, the `zidane.jpg` picture) the maximum score received differs from the one shown in the `output` folder when running YoloV3-spp from the terminal. \r\n\r\nWhen running `np.max(scores)` from the onnx prediction, one receives `0.77672607`. However when running simple terminal `python detect.py ... ` the image in the output provides scores just as high as `0.84`.\r\n\r\nIs there some additional pre- or post-processing that I am missing in my approach, when predicting from onnx?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nSebastian","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/764/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
