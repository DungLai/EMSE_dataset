It works perfectly well in any python implementation. But when I try to use the same model in C++ using openCV 3.4.6 the model returns Nan. I have tested the openCV C++ code using the yolov3.weights model that is provided by you. It works fine with that model too. Any idea as to what I am doing wrong? \r\nPS: This model is trained to predict only one class.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Train model in python using pytorch\r\n2. Convert the model_weights.pt file to model_weights.weights\r\n3. Import model in openCV C++ project\r\n4. Forward pass of model in openCV C++ project returns Nan\r\n\r\nPS: OpenCV version used for training is 3.4.2 and that used for testing on C++ is 3.4.6","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
