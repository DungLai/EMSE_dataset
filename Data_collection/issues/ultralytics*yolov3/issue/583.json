Now i want to apply your proposed test.py in order to calculate the results as:\r\n\r\n**python3 test.py --weights yolov3-openimages.weights --cfg yolov3-openimages.cfg --data open images.data.**\r\n\r\nNow my main concerns are:\r\nin openimage.data (provided in internet) the information is as below:\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses= 601\r\ntrain  = /home/pjreddie/data/openimsv4/openimages.train.list\r\n#valid  = coco_testdev\r\nvalid = data/coco_val_5k.list\r\nnames = data/openimages.names\r\nbackup = /home/pjreddie/backup/\r\neval=coco\r\n\r\nshould we change the train and valid to ones related to open image? MAP is calculated on test dataset , why we use them?\r\n\r\n2: how can we just do the MAP calculation on any specific self-made test folder ( for example just 10 images)\r\n\r\nSorry it was long and thank you for in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
