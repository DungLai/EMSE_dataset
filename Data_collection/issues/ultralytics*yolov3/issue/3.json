All show about 2X improvements using CE, though the YOLOv3 paper states these loss terms as BCE in darknet.\r\n\r\nThe two loss terms are on lines 162 and 163 of `models.py`. If anyone has any insight into this phenomenon I'd be very interested to hear it. For now you can swap the two back and forth. Note that SGD does not converge using either BCE or CE, so that issue appears independent of this one.\r\n\r\n![ce_vs_bce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/45031186-6d26d800-b04e-11e8-9fbe-c682c9ce20b9.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
