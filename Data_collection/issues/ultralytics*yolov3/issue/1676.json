First of all, I believe for the pre-trained weight, --img-size of 640 is optimal since I believe pre-trained yolov3.pt model was trained with the dimension of 640x640 and hence the detection performance is optimized for that resolution if I am correct? For confidence threshold and iou threshold (--conf-thres, --iou-thres), I am not sure which parameters to choose, and the default parameters are 0.25, 0.45 respectively but I was unsure if those values are already optimal values for the pretrained weight, otherwise I am thinking to find values by for example for loop (iteratively) to find the best values. I hope that my question is logical and I really appreciate any suggestion or clarification. Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nI am making inference on my own custom sequence of images using detect.py with the pretrained weight of yolov3.pt","closed_by":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
