This is because the FourCC code is hardcoded to 'avc1' instead of using the input video's fourcc. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run '''python3 detect.py --images ~/Video_File_Here.mp4\r\n2. You then see verbose output and the network is running properly\r\n3. No output file is generated.\r\n\r\n(When I changed the output fourcc to mp4 it output the video fine.)\r\nAlso, there is some unclarity in the code and there should be an else block instead of just an if statement then another unindented. It is the block '''if save_path!=vid_path'''\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOutput a video file to the specified directory\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n - Version 18.04\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Device: [e.g. iPhoneXS]\r\n - OS: [e.g. iOS8.1]\r\n - Version [e.g. 22]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
