The picture of losses is below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11806040/59606687-5ae0db00-9144-11e9-920f-3d207514751d.png)\r\nAs you can see each loss decrease as expected. (I don't change any code of this repo, so how data go through and how to compute loss is as same as this repo.) But accuracy (mAP) start from 55.4 to 55.3, 55.1 and so on at each epoch. (I use yolov3 model.) Moreover, I notice that hypeparameter \"iou_t\" will effect this problem a lot. When I use 0.5 as iou_t like previous repo, accuracy start from 55.4 and drop to 49.X quickly.\r\nWhat I am confused is that if losses decrease then accuracy must improve right? I use coco dataset so I think overfitting is kind of impossible. For more details, the initial learning rate is 1e-4, and other hyperparameters are as same as this repo.\r\nDo you have any ideas?","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
