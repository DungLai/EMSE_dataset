They generally perform well (to within 1% of darknet training from scratch(!)) but they appear to cause overfitting in validation Confidence in particular.\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/907195d77f2ad921cb180c3c454eae1159fa1a21/train.py#L36-L55\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/446#issuecomment-520711001 by @phino10 and https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310#issuecomment-521115339 by @Aurora33 for two overfitting examples. \r\n\r\nOne thing I notice is that `hyp['obj_pw'] = 3.941` is very high compared to `hyp['cls_pw'] = 1.446`. This may cause aggressive performance gains at the beginning of training at the expense of overfitting later in training. One option would be to manually lower `hyp['obj_pw']` and to increase `hyp['obj']` to compensate, perhaps in equal measure (i.e. divide by 2 and multiply by 2).","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
