I am using it in a Windows Python 3.7 environment, and have successfully trained and tested a custom network using this framework!\r\n\r\nI did find some bugs in the master though. \r\n1) Some os operations ('cp', 'rm') not supported in Windows - I could hack around these.\r\n2) Bug on sending data_cfg dictionary to test.test(), which is expecting a string to start (also calls load_data_cfg()).  I did hack around this one by storing and passing the path string.\r\n\r\nA somewhat unrelated bug is the use of the name test.py.  I was unable to debug this with spyder until I changed the name of this module to a more unique type (I used yolo_test.py, and debugging worked).  I am wondering if there is a reserved word conflict with the name test.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRob\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
