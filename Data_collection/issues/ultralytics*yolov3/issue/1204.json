Before, I just learn to *use* your code but not *learn*. In my summer break, I have more time for improving PyTorch skill.\r\nI have some simple question about the implement of your work. \r\n\r\n1. \r\n`model.nc = nc  # attach number of classes to model\r\n    model.hyp = hyp  # attach hyperparameters to model\r\n    model.gr = 1.0  # giou loss ratio (obj_loss = 1.0 or giou)\r\n    model.class_weights`\r\nI cannot find where are these attributes in class `Darknet` of model.py.\r\n\r\n2. Is there improvement with `class_weights`?\r\n\r\n3. I try `multi-class` on VOC, but it does not affect the mAP.\r\n\r\n4. I try focal loss. It is no difference in training phase. But testing time increase nearly 4x. \r\n   But I don't find something related to focal loss in `test.py`.\r\n    Why is it happen? \r\n\r\nI am your team's biiiiiig fan. Hope my questions do not bother you.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
