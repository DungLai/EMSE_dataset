I ran out-of-the-box transfer training using both this repository, following the single-class transfer training instructions and using (modified to single class) yolov3.cfg, and compared with the keras/TF-based yolov3 network at https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO. The latter's accuracy at converging quickly to an accurate cat face identifier was comparatively remarkable. I couldn't get anywhere near as good results with this current implementation using the same training data. The best I managed to obtain was switching to use the `--adam` optimizer and including `--multi-scale`, but otherwise following the instructions. I'm wondering if I'm missing anything obvious?\r\n\r\n![training_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/869232/68026943-77128e00-fc87-11e9-96bc-5ae91e91abe9.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
