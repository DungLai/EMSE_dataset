It is really helpming me out.\r\n\r\nI have a questions regarding **Transfer Learning**.\r\n\r\nWhen you do transfer learning you use a pretrained model. In order to apply transfer learning you need that the input images are input in the network the same way as the original network did.\r\nIn your code, I am not quite sure if you are normalizing correctly. \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/c89982d1348edf3794e6539d9d72b82bada0a470/utils/datasets.py#L260\r\n\r\nYou just re-range you input image to lie within the range 0-1. But this is not done that way normally. \r\n\r\nIn this pytorch tutorial [(https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/intro-to-pytorch/Part%208%20-%20Transfer%20Learning%20(Solution).ipynb)] for Transfer Learning they rerange th input image with the function transforms.ToTensor() and then normalize taking into account the means and standard deviations that were used in the pretrained model, i.e., `transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406],[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) `.\r\n\r\nYour model weights \"yolov3.pt\" how were obtained?\r\n\r\nAlthough the network is actually able to train well, I think this should be handled and taken into account properly. I hope you can explain me why you decided to implement the normalization like this. \r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/241/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
