I find an interesting phenomenon. When I trained on my custom dataset, I used YOLOv3-SPP anf I modified a new network named YOLOv3+-SPP. In YOLOv3+-SPP, I add a new detection branch. So I ran the kmeans on my dataset. And when the number of anchors is 9, I got following sizes. \r\n`anchors = 21.3,21.8,  26.1,24.7,  24.0,29.5,  32.6,26.8,  28.0,34.3,  34.8,36.2,  30.7,45.8,  52.9,29.2,  33.6,54.4`\r\nBut when the number of anchors is 12, I got following sizes:\r\n`anchors = 21.1,21.7,  26.11,23.6,  23.0,28.4,  28.6,29.4,  34.0,25.2,  27.8,34.6,  35.2,35.1,  30.0,41.7,  28.4,49.9,  53.7,28.0,  36.0,47.3,  34.8,56.6`\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, no matter which model is used, the anchor size of the same detection branch should remain the same. But in the current situation, '52.9, 29.2' is much larger than '36.0, 47.3' in first detection branch. Is this my idea right?
