I have a big dataset and, in each image, there are more then one object annotated. All the dataset is about one class only (car, for example). \r\nMy question is: in the train process, the YOLO will use all the image to learn or it will take only the boxes annotation area to learn? Imagine I have one image with 3 car. In the training process the model will consider 3 images or only one? Is he learn also about the environment? And the image_size is  relationship with the full image or with the tags sizes?
