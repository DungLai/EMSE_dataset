When I read the cfg files, I meet two questions. \r\n\r\nFirst, in the yolov3-spp.cfg, I notice that the pad of 1×1convolution is 1.  If filled with1, the feature map dimension will decreasae. But I think 1×1convolution should not change feature map width and height. How to understand this?\r\n\r\nSecond, I found the accuracy of yolov3-spp is higher than the yolov3. Assume the input is 416×416×3, the network will detect on 13×13, 26×26 and 52×52. Why SPP is only used on feature maps at 13×13 scale? \r\n\r\nThanks and look forward to your reply.","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
