I already watched several tutorials and did some research on the Tensorboard webpage, but couldn't find an answer because it seems like everbody just uses the loss function and so on... \r\nOr is there only the possibility to determine the accuracy/ the quality of the net via Precision, recall etc?\r\nThank you very much for tips and explanations :)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Alex1101a","id":51357752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex1101a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex1101a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
