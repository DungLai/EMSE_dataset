I am trying to add a custom class(elevator door) to your data and train a yolov3-tiny model. I have added my class and trained the model for 300 epochs with no error. My first question is should I choose single-cls and 'store_true' or 'store_false' if I want to detect all objects and classes? (I currently have chosen store_false and I am getting wrong results, I see all zero classes in train_batch0.jpg photo) and Do you know what might be any other issue here that I am getting bad results? I have attached my code, results.txt file and some resulting images for you.\r\nThank You\r\n\r\n[results.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/files/4653288/results.txt)\r\n\r\n[train.py.zip](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/files/4653295/train.py.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n![test_batch0_gt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32945083/82381571-4d307700-99df-11ea-8118-bade1b2a1752.jpg)\r\n\r\n![train_batch0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32945083/82380585-8831ab00-99dd-11ea-97d3-da41b7ad0a94.jpg)\r\n\r\n![bus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32945083/82380697-c16a1b00-99dd-11ea-919d-5e62fe7f9cee.jpg)\r\n\r\n![video_2020-05-16_21-52-32 001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32945083/82380717-c9c25600-99dd-11ea-8b5f-af86db24454e.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
