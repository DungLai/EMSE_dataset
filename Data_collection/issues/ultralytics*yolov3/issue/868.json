Although the results I got were not so satisfying (~0.20 mAP). Then looking for possible reasons, I found that on the expense of the speed of the current yolo network I used, some other networks (such as resnet) could possible return with a better result. \r\nI realized then that there is another available .cfg that You offer (_csresnext50-panet-spp.cfg_) and after training with this network, but exactly on the same setup from before, it gave me much better results (~0.50 mAP).\r\n\r\nThus, I have two questions.\r\n1) Are You planning to (or is it possible that) provide more/different networks with this repo?\r\n2) Could You provide any description about the current networks? I couldnt find anything about the csresnext50-panet-spp and I would like to know what it is exactly (so maybe I could adopt a simple resnet50/resnet101 on my own).\r\n\r\nThank You for your time to answer!","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/868/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
