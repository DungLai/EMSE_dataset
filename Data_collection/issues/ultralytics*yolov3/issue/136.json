Or it might simply just my computer's environment issue? my python version is 3.6.5 and Pytorch version is 0.4.1.\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"Sibozhu","id":22118253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTE4MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22118253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu","html_url":"https://github.com/Sibozhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
