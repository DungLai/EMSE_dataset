It is amazing!\r\nI am following this tutorial to learn YOLO: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Example:-Transfer-Learning \r\nDuring testing, I used the command like this:\r\n**python3 train.py --data data/coco16.data --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg --weights weights/yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt --transfer**\r\n\r\nI got the error saying :\r\n\r\nusage: train.py [-h] [--epochs EPOCHS] [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--cfg CFG]\r\n                [--data DATA] [--multi-scale]\r\n                [--img-size IMG_SIZE [IMG_SIZE ...]] [--rect] [--resume]\r\n                [--nosave] [--notest] [--evolve] [--bucket BUCKET]\r\n                [--cache-images] [--weights WEIGHTS] [--name NAME]\r\n                [--device DEVICE] [--adam] [--single-cls]\r\n**train.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --transfer**\r\n\r\nI checked the train.py file, it does not have the parameter \"transfer\", so I think maybe this function is been removed in the latest version. Maybe my command is wrong.\r\nMay I know whether transfer learning is available in current code? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ZihaoCheng001","id":26185398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTg1Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26185398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihaoCheng001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihaoCheng001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
