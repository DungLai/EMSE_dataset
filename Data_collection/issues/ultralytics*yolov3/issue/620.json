I stopped my training process several times in between and restarted using --resume. But when I do --resume, it takes the weigths from last.pt. I was wondering if it still uses the weights from yolov3-spp or it just lost that track and trains with the last weight? Since that will worsen the result as my model wasn't converged at last.pt.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Pari-singh","id":24270022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjcwMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24270022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh","html_url":"https://github.com/Pari-singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pari-singh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
