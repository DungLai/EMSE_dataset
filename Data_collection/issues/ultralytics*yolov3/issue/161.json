You changed the training epoch to 269 instead of previous 100 epochs. In your readme the mAP is higher 54.9 for 416*416 instead of 52.2. \r\n\r\nHow many epochs did you train to get 54.9? Because I have been retraining using your latest code. I am only getting ~49 after 70+ epochs. In the previous version it should be around 51+ mAP after 70+epochs. One difference is also lr, you used to lower down the lr at 50 epoch, now only at 250. Below shows the results that I am getting. Am I missing any information that I should be aware of?
