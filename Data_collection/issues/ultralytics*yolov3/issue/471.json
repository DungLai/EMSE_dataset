Nice of you to share this great work.\r\nI currently have some proplems using cv2 to reproduce the work.\r\nI have already trained a weight on my custom dataset and works well on your code.\r\nI am trying to use opencv to read the network, by using cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet. \r\nHowever, nothing is detected. The network is loaded successfully.\r\nDo you have any idea on this issue.\r\nLooking forward to your kind reply.\r\n\r\nMy opencv job basically follows[https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/YoloObjectDetection/yolo.py](url)","closed_by":{"login":"ShawnCheung123","id":31264474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjY0NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31264474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123","html_url":"https://github.com/ShawnCheung123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShawnCheung123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
