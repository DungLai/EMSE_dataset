The README.md shows the numbers:\r\nmAP = 43.3, AP@50 = 63.0\r\nAre these numbers based on COCO 2017? From the codes, I believe it is 2017. \r\n\r\nAlso, to compare with the original darknet53,\r\nmAP=33.0, AP@50 = 57.9\r\nAre these numbers also based on COCO 2017? The original paper says COCO test-dev but it didn't say which version...\r\n\r\nI need to compare the pretrained network detection performance (mAP and AP@50) to the original implementation. I would appreciate it if you could clarify it, thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"takehiro-code","id":37992527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTkyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37992527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code","html_url":"https://github.com/takehiro-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takehiro-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1769/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
