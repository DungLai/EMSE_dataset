Now I am working currently on code to read out the outputs to make a bounding box appear in ARKit however, the problem that i am having is that not all outputs are clear to me. \r\n\r\nHere is screenshot from the output\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1026038/94856918-8b09c700-03e5-11eb-8589-abe56eff8690.png)\r\n\r\nNote that I understand the grid size (80x80, 40x40, 20x20) which makes sense, what I dont understand yet is the values 1, 3 and 7 as part of the multiarray. what do they correspond too. I am trying to do a similar thing what iDetection does, so would be great if you guys even have the code just to convert from MLMultiArray to confidence and bounding box values. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if someone can point me to documentation of the output generated by the model. \r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
