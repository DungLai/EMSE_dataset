We have followed the tutorial, changed the data directories as detailed (images and labels along with the yaml that that links to them, that replaces the default coco128.yaml) and have started basic training with the pre-trained weights linked to in the repository.\r\nHowever, when we try to detect (to test our trained architecture / weights), we receive a detection with class names from the original coco - \"frisbee\" and \"sports ball\".\r\nIs it possible to use the pre-trained weights against a custom dataset? Is there something we should be configuring to make it work that currently do not?\r\n\r\nThanks alot!\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33690998/120200903-84aa4400-c22d-11eb-860f-e27c1e12aef7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33690998/120201022-a4da0300-c22d-11eb-9270-e302688f3e84.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"YanivO1123","id":33690998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjkwOTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33690998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123","html_url":"https://github.com/YanivO1123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YanivO1123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
