I'm doing some research of tiny-yolo so I need to reproduce the result, which is the mAP, of tiny-yolo. In the [README.md](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/README.md) you mention the COCOmAP@0.5 of size 416 is 33.0, while I only get 30.7 when I trained the tiny-yolo from scratch. My trainning command is:\r\n` python3 train.py --cfg=cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg --batch-size=64  --device=1,2 --weights= `\r\nAnd I do the training with 2 RTX 2080Ti GPU.\r\n\r\nThe results is attached[results.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/files/3938497/results.txt).\r\n\r\n Is there any suggestion for my training to increase the mAP to 33.0? \r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
