It allows for up to 50% memory savings in modern architectures such as ResNet, ResNeXt and Wider ResNet by redefining BN + non linear activation as a single in-place operation, while smartly dropping or recomputing intermediate buffers as needed.\r\n\r\nProbably change this part of the code\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/models.py#L33-L36\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif bn:\r\n    modules.add_module('batch_norm_%d' % i, nn.BatchNorm2d(filters))\r\nif module_def['activation'] == 'leaky':\r\n    modules.add_module('leaky_%d' % i, nn.LeakyReLU(0.1, inplace=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom modules.bn import ABN\r\n\r\nABN(filters)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mapillary/inplace_abn","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
