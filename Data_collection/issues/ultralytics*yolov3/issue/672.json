The first photo was training 2 hours and the second one 129 hours. I've got some questions:\r\n1.I wonder why the 1000 photos tests shows so good results on graph even if this was much smaller database and working much worse on real tests, when I'm testing these weights on real videos. \r\n2.Could you tell why the validation is better than train (I guess that's the effect of augmention and that 96% of photos are in training set)\r\n3. why the last sample on the bars is sticking out from previous ones (for example Recall is jumping to 0.6 on the first photo)?\r\n4. Why the metrics after resume is not so good (third photo, I think that I resumed from last.pt)?\r\n5. What more interesting conclusion could I get  (or maybe i could generate a table with AP's for each classes)?\r\nKind Regards.\r\n\r\n\r\n![ResumesAfter100epoch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48120287/69911759-83be0980-1420-11ea-9c76-f4abafa9cd4d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
