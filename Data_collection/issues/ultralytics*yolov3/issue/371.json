I have been working on a side project involving yolov3 and added some extra modules.\r\nI did my modification on a code version from the 12th of April. I recently uploaded my code to your checkout of the 9th of July nevertheless I am getting a different mAP from the previous version.\r\nI also observed that in this version of the code there is no big difference between the mAP at a conf-thres of 0.1 and 0.001. \r\nyou certainly did some changes in this last 3 months but I didn't find any documentation on the changes on to the test pipeline. \r\nFurthermore, why did you need to apply those changes since you were getting the same results as you are getting now?\r\nthanks very much. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ahmedtalbi","id":7291728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7291728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedtalbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedtalbi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
