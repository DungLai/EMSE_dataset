However, I have stumbled upon something I would categorize a bug.\r\n\r\nMy pictures are fairly large (4000px * 3000px). I, therefore, tile the images to avoid downscaling the pictures (and thereby risking labels being 2px * 2px in some cases). Each tile will contain at least one sign and typically be 608 * 608 pixels.\r\n\r\nThe problem appears when i start training on these tiles/images. In commits from cfc562c2c889cc7a4cb7e6c3b020ec6e36ce6bc4 and older, some of the images will be mirrored. As seen in the picture below the two images in the first column is mirrored where the two pictures in the second column are unmodified. This is suboptimal for traffic sign detection, as some of the signs may mean something different when mirrored.\r\n\r\n![train_batch0 - cfc562c2c889cc7a4cb7e6c3b020ec6e36ce6bc4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7311836/66754447-431d2780-ee96-11e9-889d-50248a3d9115.jpg)\r\n\r\nNewer commits (from 88ba61505fa07b12b608f598ed9d2cf91ff872c2), however, are not only mirroring the images but are also padding them with other images found in the dataset. The bottom row of the below image are both mirrored and padded, where the first row is only padded.\r\n\r\n![train_batch0 - 88ba61505fa07b12b608f598ed9d2cf91ff872c2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7311836/66754781-07cf2880-ee97-11e9-8402-fbdd70824d59.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn case this is a feature rather than a bug, is there anyway to turn this behaviour off?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
