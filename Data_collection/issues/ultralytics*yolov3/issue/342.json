I really appreciate it. I had two questions.\r\n**Describe the issue**\r\n(1). The formula of IoU  \"iou = [wh_iou(x, gwh) for x in layer.anchor_vec]\" always compare with anchor boxes, but those anchor boxes are prior fixed boxes which means we always compare the same thing.\r\nIt might be good at the beginning of training, but as the model has grown, won't it be better to compare with some new states of boxes?\r\n(2). If (1) is true, the reject mask \"j = iou > iou_thres\" will always neglect those targets which are not similar to the prior boxes, and will never be learned by our model?\r\n\r\nBut seems the issues above may be offset by the multi-scale process. \r\nI'm not sure which part I miss, I hope anyone can help. Thanks in advance here.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47523852/59933683-80d7e980-947c-11e9-81ea-9ccebeb900d5.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rayjan0114","id":47523852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTIzODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47523852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114","html_url":"https://github.com/rayjan0114","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjan0114/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
