I have CUDA 11 installed, but maybe it's not compatible with the version of Tensorflow being used here. \r\n\r\nAs a secondary question: what's going on with tensorflow here? I thought this library used PyTorch, and I was under the impression that PyTorch and Tensorflow were basically alternatives rather than libraries that would be used together.
