The [PyTorch 1.2 release](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases/tag/v1.2.0) updated some of the BatchNorm2D weight initializations (from 0-1 uniform random to all 1s), so I thought this would be a good time to benchmark the model and test the default repo against 3 possible improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Default `nn.LeakyReLU(0.1, inplace=True)`\r\n2. Swish `class Swish(nn.Module)`\r\n3. PRELU `nn.PReLU(num_parameters=filters)`\r\n4. PRELU `nn.PReLU(num_parameters=1)`\r\n\r\nI benchmarked 5ff6e6b3a56d8c271e4ab6947b4af1b31f813942 with each of the above activations on the small coco_64img.data tutorial dataset:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --img-size 416 --data data/coco_64img.data --batch-size 16 --accumulate 4 --nosave\r\n```\r\n![results_activations_416](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/62826466-553fc880-bbbc-11e9-965d-8ef55bdfe021.png)\r\n\r\nPReLU looks promising, but we can't draw any conclusions from this small dataset. In my next post I will plot the results on the full coco dataset trained to 10% of the final epochs, which should be a much more useful comparison.\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --img-size 320 --data data/coco.data --batch-size 32 --accumulate 2 --epochs 27 --nosave\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/441/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
