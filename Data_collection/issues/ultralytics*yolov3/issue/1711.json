I have tried running the training with (yolov3-spp.pt) and without pretrained weights. I am attaching the results from last training after 150 epochs. I noticed the overfitting of val/obj_loss, but can't find the reason for it and how to fix it. There are ~100 000 images, which I tried dividing into train and val by 80:20 ratio and also 50:50 but in each case val/obj_loss is rising. Original images are 640x512 and I am running with --img-size 416.\r\n\r\n![metrics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39414114/110653876-f12d1e00-81bd-11eb-8e6c-70ee2187e980.png)\r\n![losses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39414114/110653897-f4c0a500-81bd-11eb-98a6-5ca9811b8727.png)\r\n![media_images_Mosaics_1_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39414114/110653937-fd18e000-81bd-11eb-90d1-c7d6913c5bf3.png)\r\n![media_images_Mosaics_1_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39414114/110653943-fee2a380-81bd-11eb-954c-1cf0c3ce9509.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
