I did take look at the code and I described the code in the last section.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. have some training on transfer learning with --transfer flag\r\n2. Ctrl+C\r\n3. resume the training by the exactly same command plus --resume flag\r\n4. starts from epoch number 1.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTo resume training from latest.pt\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI looked at the train.py (line 98 to 108), the code specifically did treat if the transfer flag is on, the model will retrain from epoch 1. otherwise will retrain from latest.py. Any chance we can get resume on transfer learning as well?\r\n\r\n**What I did make it seems working**\r\nSo I copied line 107 `chkpt = torch.load(latest, map_location=device)  # load checkpoint` and replaced into line 98 `chkpt = torch.load(weights + 'yolov3-spp.pt', map_location=device)` It looks like it is doing transfer learning and start from latest.pt. However, I am not sure if this is doing actually what I expected it to do. Any idea?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
