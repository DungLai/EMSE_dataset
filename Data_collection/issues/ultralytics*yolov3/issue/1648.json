The saved images are annotated for training.  The background of the images are very simple, so I totally annotated more than 4000 images and trained the network for 120 epochs.\r\n\r\nwith the trained weights file, I run detect.py file.\r\nFor some images, the detection result are very good(those objects that should be detected are all well detected.), but for some other images, no objects are detected.\r\nSuch as, for 331st frame, the detection result is very good, but for 332nd frame, no objects are detected at all.\r\n\r\nFor 331st and 332nd  images that are continuous and very very similar, but the detection result is greatly different. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and Best Regards,\r\nArdeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ardeal","id":6227348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjczNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6227348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal","html_url":"https://github.com/ardeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ardeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
