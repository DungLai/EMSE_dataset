I've been training using default setting and now is in epoch 241 with the result below (Fig. 1). I have some inquires below.\r\n1. Is the result you report [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3#map) and mAP result in Fig. 1 calculated with same metric?\r\n2. Continuing (1), what is the metric for the mAP? (i) 0.5 or (ii) 0.5:0.05:0.95? Because for (ii), [the original paper](chrome-extension://kjlghdmljfgngjdpeaiogebkiilpiimk/pdf_viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1804.02767.pdf) reports ~33%.\r\n3. Still continuing (1), what is also the metric of the R (recall)? Is it: (i) general recall: recall for all objects (instances), or (ii) ARmax=1/10/100 as in COCO [here](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval)? \r\n4. So far, the recall is still only ~54.7% (Fig. 1), is it true to expect recall value of 77.3% in the end of epoch? (274 epochs)\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nFig. 1:\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BLzL7ZK/241epoch-result.png?raw=true)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
