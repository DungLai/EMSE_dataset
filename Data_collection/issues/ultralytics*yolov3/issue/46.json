The first epoch runs fine from 8 down.\r\n\r\nI am training on a custom dataset. My imagesizes vary.\r\n\r\nRunning it on a GTX1070.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nmulti_scale is set to false\r\nwhile training used memory of my gtx is:\r\n2445/8116mib\r\nAfter the first epoch the usage of vram bloats. I just could check it mid epochchange and it was nearly completly used till it ran out of memory again. Whats running that is so intensive in between epochs?
