the code, there are many line that uses the following import syntax to import package:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom models.common import Conv, DWConv\r\nfrom utils.google_utils import attempt_download\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\naccording to python syntax(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports):\r\nabsolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as when a directory inside a package ends up on sys.path):\r\n<pre><code>\r\nimport mypkg.sibling  \r\nfrom mypkg import sibling  \r\nfrom mypkg.sibling import example  \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nHowever, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\nfrom . import sibling  \r\nfrom .sibling import example  \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nStandard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always use absolute imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor complex package layouts, especially, if we would like to change yolov3 package layout, such as new layout is:\r\nproject\r\n--------yolov3\r\n--------api.py\r\n--------example.py\r\n--------weights_folder\r\n--------output_folder\r\n\r\n**for the above layout, explicit relative import is necessary.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
