The UWP has only support for 7, 8 and 9 opset versions, so I modified the file export.py to produce the opset version I need.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, img, f, verbose=False, opset_version=9, input_names=['images'],\r\n                          output_names=['classes', 'boxes'] if y is None else ['output'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to export the model, I get an error.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error, modify the line mentioned above in the export.py file and execute\r\n\r\n```\r\npython models/export.py --weights yolov3.pt --img 640 --batch 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the same error in both, yolov3 and tiny-yolov3\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nStarting ONNX export with onnx 1.8.0...\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/torch/onnx/symbolic_helper.py:267: UserWarning: You are trying to export the model with onnx:Upsample for ONNX opset version 9. This operator might cause results to not match the expected results by PyTorch.\r\nONNX's Upsample/Resize operator did not match Pytorch's Interpolation until opset 11. Attributes to determine how to transform the input were added in onnx:Resize in opset 11 to support Pytorch's behavior (like coordinate_transformation_mode and nearest_mode).\r\nWe recommend using opset 11 and above for models using this operator. \r\n  \"\" + str(_export_onnx_opset_version) + \". \"\r\nONNX export success, saved as yolov3.onnx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the export has been made succesfuly but when I try to import it in my UWP project the onnxruntime throws this error\r\n\r\n```\r\n'[ShapeInferenceError] Number of elements of input 'scales' must be same as rank of input 'X' and element type must be float.'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have to say I managed to import tiny-yolov2 from [here](https://github.com/onnx/models) in my project. Is it possible to downgrade YoloV3 opset? Or should I look for a way to train YoloV2?\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nA succesful export\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nGoogle Colab\r\n\r\n - OS: Google Colab\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
