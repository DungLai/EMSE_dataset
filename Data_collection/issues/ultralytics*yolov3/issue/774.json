Similar works are scarce so I made a small dataset using **LabelImg**. Then I trained about 300 epochs and here is my result:\r\n![1361578737167_ pic_hd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53228383/72202999-02d34280-34a1-11ea-8e98-35ab7f29fe28.jpg)\r\nAll the curves seem not to decrease anymore, but **Precision**,**Recall** and **mAP** are still pretty unacceptable. A weird phenomenon is the curves are oscillating sharply(I knew on some big datasets like COCO even if ur model is not that good u possibly get a stable but slightly lower mAP). \r\nSo I tried evolving hyper-parameters , less lr, different lr reducing method, more data augmentation ... but I haven't seen satisfying results( I also have a 25 pics test set, lots of objects are missed and even the recognized ones get a low confidence value).\r\nSo my question is , --according to the results, should I adjust my dataset (e.g. re-label some inaccurate bboxs or fill more images in) or continue to change the hyper-parameters? if the latter, which hyper-parameters are *mastering* the results ?\r\nmaybe someone could offer some suggestion?? ðŸ˜Š","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
