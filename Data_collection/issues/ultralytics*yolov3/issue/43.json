The first two things I noticed are:\r\n\r\n1. **Darknet training speed appears quite slow**. In darknet `yolov3.cfg`, `max_batches = 500200` is the total train time, and `batch=64` is the images per batch, then this will take about 28 days on a GCP P100 at about 18,000 batches per day (all train settings to default).\r\n2. **Darknet appears set to train for 267 epochs.** This is 500200 batches times 64 images per batch divided by 120,000 images in the training set. Can this be right? This seems like a lot.\r\n2. **Darknet is using multi_scale training**, changing the image size every 10 batches. I've set this behavior as well in this repo if `-multi_scale = True` in train.py (though currently this changes the size every batch).","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/43/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
