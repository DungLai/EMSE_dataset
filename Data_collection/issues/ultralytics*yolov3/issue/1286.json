I would like to train 4 channel images by combining 1 RGB image and 1 infrared image. I have referred to #1037 for the settings. However, I want to use `torch.cat` in the dataloader, so it will load 2 images from 2 folders. \r\n\r\nIs there any guides where I should change the settings again? For example changing the `path` in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/82f653b0f579db97f8908800d45e8f5287f79bd3/utils/datasets.py#L258-L260 \r\nWhere else should I change?\r\n\r\nAlso one more question, will the weight after training be saved? Where can I find it? \r\n\r\nThanks and really appreciate for the repository!","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
