If possible, pls help to answer it, thank in advance:\r\n1.  normally, the YOLOV4 should be calculated the anchors data by kmeans before training, But I didn't find the corresponding code. Does it mean no need to calculate this in the code?\r\n2. I found the code as below:\r\n`method, mp, s = 3, 0.9, 0.2 \r\nnpr = np.random\r\nnpr.seed(int(time.time()))   #the seed num would be changed by time flows, then how to recurrent the result?\r\ng = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, .1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # gains\r\nng = len(g)\r\n#the three methods below are almost same, but just the third method restrict the lower and upper data..\r\n# I'm not clear why to discriminate these methods..\r\nif method == 1:\r\n    v = (npr.randn(ng) * npr.random() * g * s + 1) ** 2.0\r\nelif method == 2:\r\n    v = (npr.randn(ng) * npr.random(ng) * g * s + 1) ** 2.0\r\nelif method == 3:\r\n    v = np.ones(ng)\r\n    while all(v == 1):   #v is just created before, it is certainly all the v is 1...Does it unnecessary?\r\n        v = (g * (npr.random(ng) < mp) * npr.randn(ng) * npr.random() * s + 1).clip(0.3, 3.0)`\r\n\r\n3.  I found some hyparameters had been set in the codes, it seems also download evolve.txt to get a better hyparameters.. But why some of the hyparameters also need to be reset by codes... if hyparameters  should be reset, why not to set the correct data at first...\r\nDue to my pool English, maybe some of questions are not described accuracy. I hope I can get the  explaination from your side....Many thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1372/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
