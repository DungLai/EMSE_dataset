I get the following error message:\r\n`UnboundLocalError: local variable 'epoch' referenced before assignment`\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. I ran the following command and everything went smoothly. The weights saved and I was able to see how the model functioned on real data.\r\n`!python3 train.py --data data/coco1cls.data --epochs 10`\r\n\r\n2. I then tried to train off the saved weights of the first ten epochs by running the following command:\r\n`!python3 train.py --data data/coco1cls.data --epochs 10 --resume`\r\n\r\nHowever, I get the following error message:\r\n```\r\nNamespace(accumulate=4, adam=False, arc='default', batch_size=16, bucket='', cache_images=False, cfg='cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg', data='data/coco1cls.data', device='', epochs=10, evolve=False, img_size=416, multi_scale=False, name='', nosave=False, notest=False, prebias=False, rect=False, resume=True, transfer=False, var=None, weights='weights/last.pt')\r\nUsing CPU\r\n\r\nCaching labels (20 found, 0 missing, 0 empty, 0 duplicate, for 20 images): 100%|‚ñà| 20/20 [00:00<00:00, 4398.62it/s]\r\nModel Summary: 225 layers, 6.29987e+07 parameters, 6.29987e+07 gradients\r\nUsing 8 dataloader workers\r\nStarting training for 10 epochs...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 463, in <module>\r\n    train()  # train normally\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 397, in train\r\n    print('%g epochs completed in %.3f hours.\\n' % (epoch - start_epoch + 1, (time.time() - t0) / 3600))\r\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'epoch' referenced before assignment\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am confused mainly because the only thing different with this is that I am resuming training, but I am getting an error message about epochs. What should I do? Thanks!
