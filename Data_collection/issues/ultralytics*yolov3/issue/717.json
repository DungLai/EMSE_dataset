It's really an amazing boost!\r\n\r\nI've tried this trick on rotate-yolov3 based on this repo, only to find F1 score **dropped** from 62.16% to  60.27% (ICDAR challenge 4 ).What's wong with my  multi-scale testing?\r\nMy methd:\r\n1. Obtain detections from random various scales(e,g 608 and 512),  which are generated via **preliminary** NMS (conf_thres=0.1, nms_thre=0.9 for speed) to reduce memory cost.\r\n2. Concat these detections (from random various scales), and conduct **formal** NMS with conf_thres=0.5, nms_thres = 0.5.\r\nAnything wrong with it?\r\nthanks.\r\n<!-- Please outline the motivation for the proposal.
