While iterator is iterating , is it pointing one image at a time or not?\r\n2 . If one image is being pointed at a time , then can someone explain what do the bbox and tbox tensors signify (because  for single variable , it is holding list of values instead.) . \r\nFor example , box1[0] should have one value which is x, but it is printing multiple values in list as you can see below , similarly same thing is happening for y,width,height\r\n![box1%5b0%5d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49546514/76075747-8e5de100-5fc3-11ea-8b43-eae3d94141e5.png)\r\n\r\nPlease give me a clear explanation on why these random multiple values are being created for each values of box1 (predicted box) and box2(tbox). \r\nin my case no of classes = 1.
