However, I'm not sure if it's suitable for my use case which is to have it run simultaneously on multiple video streams utilizing NVIDIA DeepStream. Essentially I'll train the model on my custom dataset (transfer learning), convert it to ONNX then to TensorRT, and then use the resulting TensorRT engine as part of an NVIDIA DeepStream inference plugin.\r\n\r\nI'm new to all of this and I want to make sure there isn't anything about the SPP version of this model that precludes it from being used in such a manner before I take the time to go through the above exercise of training the model and converting it to a TensorRT engine. For example, maybe there's something about the model that's specific to iOS or optimized for a single video stream, and as such may not be suitable for my purposes.\r\n\r\nCan anyone advise?
