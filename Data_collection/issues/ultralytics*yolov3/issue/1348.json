But I ran into some weird problems I can not solve.\r\n\r\nI designed a novel but simple module in `models.py` and I modified the cfg file. \r\nAt epoch 0, I got _large obj loss about 80_ and _large cls loss about 15_, only the giou loss seemed to be normal. And I got _Precision very poor and Recall about 0.12_. Besides, it became very slow when testing and _it would take quite some time to see the pbar show the ETA of testing_. \r\n**Finally, it always ran into `CUDA out of memory` problem at epoch 3 during nms of testing and the testing would always take more than half an hour!**\r\n\r\nI thought that there could be some errors in my newly designed module. \r\nSo, I just abandoned my module, only made some simple changes in the cfg file just for the part of yolo head (modified using `[route]` to achieve different path aggregation) and got a more shallow model. \r\n**But it was so weird that I ran into the problems I met above again**! I will upload the error info later.\r\n\r\n**Then I tried this simple modified cfg file with my inefficient implementation of yolov3, it didn't seem to be  strange.**\r\n\r\nDid I miss something important when I did modifications? Really need your help, thanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
