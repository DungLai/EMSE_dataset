Until I got to the section in which I want to start the training.\r\nTraining is started by executing this snippet of code:\r\n```\r\n# train yolov5s on custom data for 100 epochs\r\n# time its performance\r\n%%time\r\n%cd /content/yolov5/\r\n!python train.py --img 416 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data '../data.yaml' --cfg ./models/custom_yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --name yolov5s_results  --cache\r\n```\r\nAll parameters are fine, except for --weights ''. The tutorial says I can download weights from the Ultralytics Google Drive folder. It links to this:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Drs_Aiu7xx6S-ix95f9kNsA6ueKRpN2J\r\nUnfortunately, the link seems to be dead.\r\nIs there another download link or can I use any other weights file?\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nI was thinking about using the default weights file from this repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet\r\nBut I am unsure if that would work.\r\nThank you in advance! I love your work.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
