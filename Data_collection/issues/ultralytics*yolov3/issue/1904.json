If so, please suggest the steps.","closed_by":{"login":"KrishArul26","id":74568334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTY4MzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74568334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26","html_url":"https://github.com/KrishArul26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrishArul26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
