If we use the detect.py the Bounding-Boxes get plotted in the order from highest to lowest Class-Specific Confidence Score. Thus, the Bounding Box with the highest Class-Specific Confidence Score gets plotted first and gets overlapped by Bounding Boxes with lower values.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion:\r\nReverse this order, by adding the following Code in detect.py right before this for-loop: `for *xyxy, conf, cls in det:` (i.e. line 103 in the current repo state):\r\n```\r\ndet = det.index_select(0, torch.LongTensor([idx for idx in np.arange(det.size(0)-1, -1, -1)]).to(device))                \r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Deep-Learner","id":26065101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDY1MTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26065101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner","html_url":"https://github.com/Deep-Learner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deep-Learner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
