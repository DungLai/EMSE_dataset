Detection rate is pretty good but the problem is that it only detects meats. Meaning it can detect meats correctly but when it comes to salmon or chicken images it detects them as meat. There's no single inference other than meat basically. Is there something I've done wrong? Could low relative sample count for salmon and chicken be responsible for this? \r\n\r\nPS: \r\n-I've checked label files and they are marked with correct class id. \r\n-I've edited the .cfg file as suggested in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data step 5\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n![60](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44760523/90281193-de937600-de74-11ea-9ad9-5c438665bce3.jpg)\r\n![50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44760523/90281200-e2bf9380-de74-11ea-8331-d4ac881ac98a.jpg)\r\n![only_meat_wrong](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44760523/90286823-48b11880-de7f-11ea-82aa-1c9af0d7528e.png)\r\n\r\nfoodDetector.data:\r\n`\r\nclasses=3\r\ntrain=data\\foodDetector.txt\r\nvalid=data\\foodDetector.txt\r\nnames=data\\foodDetector.names\r\n`\r\n\r\nfoodDetector.names:\r\n`\r\nmeat\r\nsalmon\r\nchicken\r\n`","closed_by":{"login":"aizuon","id":44760523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzYwNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44760523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon","html_url":"https://github.com/aizuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aizuon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
