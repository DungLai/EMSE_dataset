I want to deploy one of them on edge devices for inference (depends whether or not yolov3 gives me fast results).\r\nMy questions are:\r\nWhat is the minimum gpu ram after which inference time won't improve. For example if I have a gpu with 8 GB ram and the same gpu with 11 ram for example, will I have an improvement in inference time? or these 3 or more GB will be spare and model won't use it.\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!Only one image is being used during inference. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nOr maybe ram isn't that important when i run model on single image and I should look at gpu transistors, GFLOPs or some other specifications.\r\nTo some up, is there any kind of formula to compute inference range based on gpu specifications.\r\nThank you in advance\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"foodeveloperbar17","id":56337065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzM3MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56337065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17","html_url":"https://github.com/foodeveloperbar17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foodeveloperbar17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/992/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
