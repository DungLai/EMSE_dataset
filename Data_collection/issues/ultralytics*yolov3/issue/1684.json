I found it is a lot more friendly than the original one.\r\n\r\n## ‚ùîQuestion\r\n\r\nI need to run the yolo model inside a rectangular object (license number plate) to detect defect printed letters. The license number plate is of a fixed size 192x32. The letters could be printed with large positional variations and with large font variations. \r\n\r\nhow to set the input image size of the detector 192x32. I've tried to set --img-size to 192 and discovered in the opt.yaml file that the input image size is 192x192. isn't it a bit of waste on running the detection on a vertically enlarged image?\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nI've searched rectangular input training in this issue list and found the answers are outdated.
