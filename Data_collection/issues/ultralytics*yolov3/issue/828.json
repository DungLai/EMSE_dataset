I have been running into some problems and really need some help here.\r\nThe task of my model is to detect small icons in a minimap of a MOBA game, the size of these icons is 26*26 pixels. I made sure all labelings are correct before I started my training process, however, during my testing, I found the bounding boxes are smaller than they should be, and classifications are not satisfying. (even though my test scores are high, with P and R both higher than 0.95)\r\nmy questions are:\r\n1. I have been trying to recalculate anchor boxes, any suggestions on calculating anchor boxes on such small images?\r\n2. what else could I have done to improve my model's precision?\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
