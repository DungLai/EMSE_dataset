I'd like to detect small objects (100x100) on 4k resolution image. For training I've croped each object from 4k resolution to 150x150 and labeled. Wich option should I chance to get Best performance? If I change only config file WxH than IT will be Not enough. I've seen that detect.py, train.py and some other codes are programed with 416x416 shape but where is necessary to change this parameters?\r\n\r\nMy approach is to train my dataset with 32x32 instead of 160x160(multiple of 32) to use in detection 4k instead of 4k about 1088x1088 resolution. This should be fast enough. With a fork of yolo with keras it works but keras is Not enough for my approach. \r\n\r\nIf I train with default parameters 416x416 then it detects nothing with 0 mAP. \r\n\r\nCould you help me with my issue. Thank you!!!
