I trained yolov4 on my custom dataset. And I have two questions.\r\n\r\n1. I downloaded the pre-training weight from the AlexAB's github. There are two weight files. The one is named yolov4.weights, and another one is named yolov4.conv.137. I can use these two weight files to train yolov4.cfg successfully. But I don't know the difference between yolov4.weights and yolov4.conv.137. In my opinion, I find that the size of yolov4.weights is larger than yolov4.conv.137. So I guess the yolov4.conv.137 is for the backbone of yolov4 which is named CSPDarkNet53.  I don't know if what I guess is correct.\r\n\r\n2. I trained many custom datasets and I found a phenomenon that the precision of yolov4 is higher than yolov3-spp, but the recall of yolov4 is lower than yolov3-spp. Do you have any suggestions?","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
