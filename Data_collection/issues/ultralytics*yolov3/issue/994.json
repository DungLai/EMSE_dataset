I read the code carefully these days and really gained a lot! Thanks for your excellent work!\r\nBy the way, I also found some problems that confused me. They are listed as blew, and I would apreciate a lot if you can explain for them. ^_^\r\n1. About prebias. As used in train.py, by default in first 3 epochs the lr is set relatively bigger and the momentum smaller, also the target for obj loss is set to 1 instead of giou. I guess this is for a faster convergence, but why this works? Is there any materals about that?\r\n2. In train.py, line 274, `loss *= batch_size / 64`, Is `loss /= accumulate` more general?\r\n3. In test.py ,line 189, `p, r, ap, f1 = p[:, 0], r[:, 0], ap.mean(1), ap[:, 0]  # [P, R, AP@0.5:0.95, AP@0.5]`. It is confusing to assign AP@0.5 to a variable named f1.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
