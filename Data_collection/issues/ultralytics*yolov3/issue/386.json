When I train with one (just one card installed in the computer) everything goes fine. But when I put another card into the computer, the training process freezes at the first epoch. I just get this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNamespace(accumulate=8, batch_size=8, bucket='', cfg='cfg/yolov3.cfg', data_cfg='data/pladenj.data', epochs=100, evolve=False, img_size=416, nosave=False, notest=False, num_workers=4, rect=False, resume=False, single_scale=False, transfer=False, var=0, xywh=False)\r\nUsing CUDA device0 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='GeForce GTX 1080 Ti', total_memory=11175MB)\r\n           device1 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='GeForce GTX 1080 Ti', total_memory=11178MB)\r\n\r\nModel Summary: 222 layers, 6.15237e+07 parameters, 6.15237e+07 gradients\r\n\r\n   Epoch       Batch   GIoU/xy        wh       obj       cls     total   targets  img_size\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it stays like this forever, then if I kill my process the whole computer just freezes and I have to restart. I checked the motherboards manual and it supports multiple gpu's. Also did some stress tests on the gpu's and everything turned out to be fine. Only thing that bothers me is when i check in the terminal on how many pci lanes they are running it says 16x on both, but in the manual it says if using multiple gpu's they should use 8x lanes. Any help greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Software:**\r\n\r\n- OS: ubuntu 18.04\r\n- Cuda: 9.1\r\n- Python: 3.7\r\n\r\n**Hardware:**\r\n\r\n- GPU: 2x Gigabyte Aurus 1080ti\r\n- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming-K7\r\n- CPU: Ryzen 1800x\r\n- RAM: 64 Gb\r\n- PSU: Corsair 1000W\r\n- Storage: 500gb SSD","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
