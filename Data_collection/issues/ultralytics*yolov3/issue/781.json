It is very useful.\r\nMy proplem is that I have my custom dataset. It is extracted from COCO dataset with 1 cell phone class. I think that I have done rightly as train single class guide. I got about 50 mAP after 200 epoch. Then I run detect.py for inference, my model is not good as darknet original model. I notice that my model return low confidence(about ~0.7). Any suggest for me?
