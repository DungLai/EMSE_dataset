I did not make a good record of it happening, but I plan to recreate it again soon and update this issue. \r\n\r\nI attempted to implement transfer learning and modified the system to detect a single class. While the model was training on the data set it froze on the 21st epoch, GPU resources were locked up, so I aborted the training. \r\n\r\nI attempted to start transfer learning training again, but it did the same thing. Everything worked fine until the 21st epoch then it froze, and seemed to happen around the same percentage. I resolved to train the model on every layer instead of implementing the transfer learning switch, and everything worked fine. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Try to train a single class model with transfer learning\r\n2. Observe the training freeze on the 21st epoch\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe model to train without any problems.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n[transfer_learning_freeze.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/files/3194791/transfer_learning_freeze.txt)\r\n![freeze](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43619961/57978127-3fab7000-79cc-11e9-8d1e-2e77f472bc6f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n N/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI was training my model on an AMD Ryzen 1600X desktop computer with an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU.","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
