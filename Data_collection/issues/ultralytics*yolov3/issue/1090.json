However the intermediate training results are not satisfying at all - while the Precision values are OK and in line with expectations, in Recall I see sudden drops. See the plot.\r\nDo you have an idea what may be causing it?\r\n\r\nThe only other parameter I changed , besides number of epochs, was batch size and accumulate -- see the commands used below.\r\n\r\n`python3 train.py --data data/custom_dataset/custom_dataset.data --weights weights/yolov3-spp.weights --img-size 608 --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --batch-size 4 --accumulate 1 --epochs 3000 --single-cls --cache-images --name custom_dataset_3000 --device 0`\r\n\r\n`python3 train.py --data data/custom_dataset/custom_dataset.data --weights weights/yolov3-spp.weights --img-size 608 --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --batch-size 2 --accumulate 8 --epochs 500 --single-cls --cache-images --name custom_dataset_500 --device 0`\r\n\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62949809/80105595-19496980-8579-11ea-81db-0adf376b3ca0.png)","closed_by":{"login":"sherman99","id":62949809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTQ5ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62949809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99","html_url":"https://github.com/sherman99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherman99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
