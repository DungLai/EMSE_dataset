I've noticed there's lot of threads about mAP and I have read them, but none of them has code to test. So I modified a little bit of your detect/test code to run pycocotools.\r\n\r\nAdded `load_images_v2` in [datasets.py](https://gist.github.com/ydixon/92da8e403cb70750f26602247e4ece77) . Run [eval_map.py](https://gist.github.com/ydixon/8f31cd9db677c357bd2a0002083a2b85) and it is compared against ground truth file [coco_valid.json](https://gist.github.com/ydixon/8ba6ef747cecfe3215960f928a4c6028). The ground truth file has been test against results generated from darknet repo with matching mAP. If you want to generate it yourself, you can go [here](https://github.com/ydixon/mAP_eval).\r\n![map_coco](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22487836/50765632-76041080-12b1-11e9-9f72-8abce7250d2e.png)\r\n\r\nI am only running the model with official yolov3 weights.
