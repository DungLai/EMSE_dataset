Otherwise we want the confidence score to equal the\r\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box and the ground truth.'\r\n\r\nDoes this explain how ground truth objectness score is calculated?\r\n\r\nIn YOLO v3 I read - 'YOLOv3 predicts an objectness score for each bounding\r\nbox using logistic regression. This should be 1 if the bounding box prior overlaps a ground truth object by more than\r\nany other bounding box prior. If the bounding box prior is not the best but does overlap a ground truth object by\r\nmore than some threshold we ignore the prediction, following [17]. We use the threshold of 0.5.'\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong but from the YOLO v3 paper it seems that the objectness score can be either 1 or 0. But according to YOLO paper, objectness score is either 0 or is set to the value of IOU(ground truth, prediction). \r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
