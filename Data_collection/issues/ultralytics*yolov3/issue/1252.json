So I tested model.  The following figures are my test results. It seems that the results are not good enough.\r\n\r\nMy current doubts are:\r\n**The mAP is around 0.473, but the plotted figures seem not match the good mAP. I mean for the mAP 0.473, the plotted figures should be better.  is this normal? If I trained more epochs, the results should be better, right?**\r\n\r\n\r\n|epoch|mem|lossbox|lossobj|losscls|losstotal|targets|img_size|P|R|mAP|F1|GIoU|obj|cls|\r\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\r\n|48/299|8.8G|3.18|1.96|1.76| 6.9|   5| 640|0.433|0.505|0.46|0.457|2.62|1.31|1.33|\r\n|49/299|8.8G|3.17|1.99|1.75|6.91|   5| 320|0.431|0.507|0.462|0.457|2.61| 1.3|1.32|\r\n|50/299|8.8G|3.17|1.95|1.74|6.86|   5| 512|0.43|0.51|0.464|0.458|2.61| 1.3|1.31|\r\n|51/299|8.8G|3.17|1.97|1.75|6.89|   5| 576|0.43|0.513|0.466|0.459| 2.6| 1.3|1.31|\r\n|52/299|8.8G|3.16|1.96|1.74|6.86|   5| 448|0.429|0.515|0.467|0.459| 2.6| 1.3| 1.3|\r\n|53/299|8.8G|3.16|1.98|1.74|6.88|   5| 448|0.427|0.518|0.469|0.46|2.59| 1.3|1.29|\r\n|54/299|8.8G|3.16|1.96|1.72|6.84|   5| 384|0.426|0.52|0.471|0.461|2.59| 1.3|1.29|\r\n|55/299|8.8G|3.15|1.95|1.72|6.82|   5| 448|0.428|0.522|0.473|0.463|2.58|1.29|1.28|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83222894-0f380d80-a1ac-11ea-933a-98633a4e0cf6.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83223385-4e1a9300-a1ad-11ea-8130-5226321074db.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83223420-5d99dc00-a1ad-11ea-9138-821891ca9f60.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83223446-6ab6cb00-a1ad-11ea-9622-4f0c9d5f0746.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83223465-76a28d00-a1ad-11ea-9d40-d75c6856883e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/83223526-976ae280-a1ad-11ea-8a31-8ccb2e116889.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
