With a few lines of code, save everything you need to debug, compare and reproduce your models — architecture, hyperparameters, git commits, model weights, GPU usage, and even datasets and predictions.\r\n\r\nW&B’s lightweight integrations work with any Python script, and you can sign up for a free account and start tracking and visualizing models in 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nUsed by top researchers including teams at OpenAI, Lyft, Github, and MILA, W&B is part of the new standard of best practices for machine learning. How W&B can help you optimize your machine learning workflows:\r\n\r\n- [Debug](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#Free-2) model performance in real time\r\n- [GPU usage](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#System-4), visualized automatically\r\n- [Custom charts](https://wandb.ai/wandb/customizable-charts/reports/Powerful-Custom-Charts-To-Debug-Model-Peformance--VmlldzoyNzY4ODI) for powerful, extensible visualization\r\n- [Share insights](https://wandb.ai/wandb/getting-started/reports/Visualize-Debug-Machine-Learning-Models--VmlldzoyNzY5MDk#Share-8) interactively with collaborators\r\n- [Optimize hyperparameters](https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps) efficiently\r\n- [Track](https://docs.wandb.com/artifacts) datasets, pipelines, and production models\r\n\r\n## Before You Start\r\n\r\nClone this repo and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies, including **Python>=3.8** and **PyTorch>=1.7**. Also install the W&B pip package `wandb`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3  # clone repo\r\n$ cd yolov3\r\n$ pip install wandb -qr requirements.txt  # install dependencies\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## First-Time Setup\r\n\r\nWhen you first train, W&B will prompt you to create a new account. Afterwards you are given an API key (you can retrieve your key from https://wandb.ai/authorize), and then this key is used to tell W&B where to log your data. You only need to supply your key once, and then it is remembered on the same device.\r\n\r\nW&B will create a cloud Project called YOLOv3 for your training runs, and each new training run will be provided a unique run name. You can also set a run name manually using \r\n```bash\r\n$ python train.py --logdir my_run_name\r\n```\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/98183367-4acbc600-1f08-11eb-9a23-7266a4192355.jpg\" width=\"800\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Viewing Runs\r\n\r\nRun information streams from your environment to the W&B cloud console as you train. This allows you to monitor and even cancel runs in **realtime**. All important information is logged:\r\n\r\n- Training losses\r\n- Validation losses\r\n- Metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95\r\n- Learning Rate over time\r\n- GPU: Type, **GPU Utilization**, power, temperature, **CUDA memory usage**\r\n- System: Disk I/0, CPU utilization, RAM memory usage\r\n- Environment: OS and Python types, Git repository and state, **training command**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/98184457-bd3da580-1f0a-11eb-8461-95d908a71893.jpg\" width=\"800\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reports\r\n\r\nW&B Reports can be created from your saved runs for sharing online. Once a report is created you will receive a link you can use to publically share your results. Here is an example report created from the COCO128 tutorial trainings of all four YOLOv5 models ([link](https://wandb.ai/glenn-jocher/yolov5_tutorial/reports/YOLOv5-COCO128-Tutorial-Results--VmlldzozMDI5OTY)). \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/98185222-794ba000-1f0c-11eb-850f-3e9c45ad6949.jpg\" width=\"800\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environments\r\n\r\nYOLOv3 may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments (with all dependencies including [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda)/[CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):\r\n\r\n- **Google Colab Notebook** with free GPU: <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"></a>\r\n- **Kaggle Notebook** with free GPU: [https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov3](https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/yolov3)\r\n- **Google Cloud** Deep Learning VM.
