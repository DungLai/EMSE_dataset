Therefore, I wonder if it's not a good choice to use this pre-trained weight when training the net on VOC2007(because it has already got a nice result on my target dataset)?\r\n\r\nActually, in my experiment, I used \"yolov3.pt\" as pre-trained weights. During the training process, the accuracy reached 0.7 in the first epoch, but suddenly drop to 0.45 in the next epoch. Besides, other metrics such as precision, recall and mAP all decrease from the first epoch to the second epoch. I think it may have something to do with pre-trained weight. \r\n\r\nIf I want to train with darknet53.conv.74 what should I do?\r\n\r\n(I also upload the picture of validation accuracy)\r\n![val_accuracy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83911312/164606690-2bc6449d-3c0f-4c22-ab86-435571d734c4.svg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mskmei","id":83911312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTExMzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83911312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei","html_url":"https://github.com/mskmei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskmei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
