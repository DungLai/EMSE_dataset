In particular, I'm looking at line 180 of utils/utils.py in ap_per_class():\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # Create Precision-Recall curve and compute AP for each class\r\n    pr_score = 0.1  # score to evaluate P and R https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/898\r\n```\r\nAssuming that's right, what is the purpose of the --conf-thres argument in test.py?\r\n\r\nAlso, at what IoU threshold are precision and recall computed?  I'm guessing 0.5 since that's the reported mAP level, but I'm not seeing where that's happening in the code.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nTim\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1053/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
