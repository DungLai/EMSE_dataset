How is it going?\r\n\r\nThe variable grid_xy is controlled by the number of grid points in both dimensions, nx and ny. These two depend on the input image dimensions as well as the stride. My question is: is it possible to change nx and ny (for example, doubling them) so that the grid can be finer and objects can be detected in a more precise way?\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnx = int(img_size[1] / stride) * 2  # number x grid points\r\nny = int(img_size[0] / stride) * 2 # number y grid points\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it needed to change the architecture (e.g. changing dimensions of intermedium pooling layers to adjust for the new grid) to achieve that? Or can it be achieved in a simpler way? It would be incredibly helpful for my task. \r\n\r\nRegards.","closed_by":{"login":"glenn-jocher","id":26833433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODMzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26833433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher","html_url":"https://github.com/glenn-jocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glenn-jocher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
