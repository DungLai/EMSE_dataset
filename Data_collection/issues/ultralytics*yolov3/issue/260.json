There are still offsets in the images, but that aside, is there a maximum number of detections per image? I am guessing no becuase when I run tests on many images (512x512), the number of detection are in the _range_ 73 to 95. Detection time is 100-120 ms per image.\r\n\r\n![gbacsrgpqfdprtdl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5787026/57191904-f880a200-6f2a-11e9-9dab-44658877b8c7.png)\r\n\r\nThere are more than 200 RBCs in the above image.
