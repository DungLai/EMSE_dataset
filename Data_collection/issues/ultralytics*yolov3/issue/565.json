One step specifically requires us to normalize the box coordinates, in the input labels, to be between 0-1. So, I converted the labels in my dataset, which provides 4 pairs of coordinates and 1 class to its x_center, y_center and w and h values respectively. My question is how do I normalize this?\r\n\r\n\r\nI used the image size of 4164163, the input image to the first conv layer is 416*416, but this doesnâ€™t work for all labels. In some cases it the midpoint of the bounding box coordinates exceed 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample in the original label file.
