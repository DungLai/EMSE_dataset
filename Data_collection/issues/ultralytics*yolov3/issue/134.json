Sorry I have to bug you for a little while this time. I had another problem during training my custom YoloV3. \r\n\r\nDuring my testing of the normal YoloV3 network, I found the Leaky ReLU layer is very time consuming while the normal ReLU layer would cost a lot less time than the leaky one. Therefore I wonder if I can just replace leaky ReLU in YoloV3 with normal ReLU. I see the way you define the \"Leaky\" activation is in the models.py https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/8c730e03cd4aa31ff316734799658ecf82e5096c/models.py#L36-L37 \r\n\r\nWhat I did is go to Pytorch doc and found the way to define normal ReLU layers (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ReLU) and then add the definition in my models.py: \r\n`            \r\nif module_def[\"activation\"] == \"ReLU\": \r\n                modules.add_module(\"ReLU_%d\" % i, nn.ReLU()) \r\n`\r\n\r\nand then replace all the `activation=leaky` in the .cfg file with `activation=ReLU` .\r\n\r\nThe training is going without any trouble. However, when it comes to the mAP, its value is infinitely close to 0 when I do validation. Also, the maximum weight value in the .weights file is extremely large.\r\n\r\nSo is it impossible to replace leaky ReLU with normal ReLU in YoloV3? Or is it just because of my incorrect implementation?","closed_by":{"login":"Sibozhu","id":22118253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTE4MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22118253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu","html_url":"https://github.com/Sibozhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibozhu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
