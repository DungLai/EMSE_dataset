I see the parameters in two cfgs files (yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg and yolov3-1cls.cfg) are quite different: \r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\nyolov3-spp-1cls.cfg has:\r\n\r\nburn_in=100\r\nmax_batches = 5000\r\npolicy=steps\r\nsteps=4000,4500\r\nscales=.1,.1\r\n\r\nwhile yolov3-1cls.cfg has: \r\n\r\nburn_in=1000\r\nmax_batches = 500200\r\npolicy=steps\r\nsteps=400000,450000\r\n\r\nMay I ask what is the intuition to decrease max_batches and steps so much in yolov3-spp? Does it affect the performance a lot? \r\n\r\nThanks so much!
