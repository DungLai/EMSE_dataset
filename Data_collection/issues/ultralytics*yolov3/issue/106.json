Transfer learning can be a useful way to quickly retrain YOLOv3 on new data without needing to retrain the entire network. We accomplish this by starting from the official YOLOv3 weights, and setting each layer's `.requires_grad` field to false that we do not want to calculate gradients for and optimize.\r\n\r\n## Before You Start\r\n\r\n1. Update (Python >= 3.7, PyTorch >= 1.3, etc.) and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies.\r\n2. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3`\r\n3. Download [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home): `bash yolov3/data/get_coco2017.sh`\r\n\r\n## Transfer Learning\r\n\r\n**1. Download pretrained weights** from our [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LezFG5g3BCW6iYaV89B2i64cqEUZD7e0) that you want to use to transfer learn, and place them in `yolov3/weights/`.\r\n\r\n**2. Update `*.cfg` file** (optional). Each YOLO layer has 255 outputs: 85 outputs per anchor [4 box coordinates + 1 object confidence + 80 class confidences], times 3 anchors. If you use fewer classes, reduce filters to `filters=[4 + 1 + n] * 3`, where `n` is your class count. This modification should be made to the layer preceding each of the 3 YOLO layers. Also modify `classes=80` to `classes=n` in each YOLO layer, where `n` is your class count.  \r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-02-21 at 19 40 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/66830924-e03f9500-ef56-11e9-9d09-97f9921cab39.png\">\r\n\r\n**3. Train.**\r\n```bash\r\npython3 train.py --data coco1cls.data --cfg yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --weights weights/yolov3-spp.pt --transfer\r\n```\r\nRun the above code to transfer learn on COCO, or specify your own data as `--data data/custom.data` (See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data). \r\n\r\nIf you created a custom `*.cfg` file, specify it as `--cfg custom.cfg`. \r\n\r\nYou can observe in the Model Summary (using `model_info(model, report='full')` in train.py) that only the 3 YOLO layers have their gradients activated now (all other layers are frozen for duration of training):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-09-12 at 12 25 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/64776415-76e3f500-d558-11e9-8172-e7286521519f.png\">\r\n\r\n## Reproduce Our Environment\r\n\r\nTo access an up-to-date working environment (with all dependencies including CUDA/CUDNN, Python and PyTorch preinstalled), consider a:\r\n\r\n- **GCP** Deep Learning VM with $300 free credit offer: See our [GCP Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart) \r\n- **Google Colab Notebook** with 12 hours of free GPU time: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw)\r\n- **Docker Image** from https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3.
