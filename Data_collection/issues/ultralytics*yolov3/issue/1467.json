Is there a specific set of settings to determine the MAP accuracy for IoU-> 0.5..0.95?\r\n(Note: Rest all the default parameter settings were used. Desired image size is 416 x 416)\r\n\r\n## While analyzing the object-detection networks I endeavor to first reproduce some of the tabulated mAP-results published at the github site: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 by using the latest cloned repository from this site.\r\nHowever, while I could generate almost identical mAP results against the “YoloV3-SPP-Ultralytics” network through the command: $ python3 test.py --cfg yolov3-spp.cfg --weights yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt –img-size 640 –augment, when compared with the screenshot on the github site; the same was not entirely true for some of the other networks, for which the comparison is made with the tabulated results.\r\nIn particular, I have the following queries towards obtaining the mAP accuracy against other networks:\r\n1.\tAs per the tabulated mAP figures for Tiny-YoloV3 (@ image-size 416), the expected mAP with IoU:0.5 is 0.33, and the same for IoU: 0.5:0.95 is 0.16. Using the COCO-2014 dataset, I could closely obtain the expected accuracy with IoU -> 0.5 (using IoU-Thresh of 0.5), but I am unsure of the specific configuration required to obtain mAP against IoU -> 0.5:0.95. In this respect the github site states using an IoU-Thresh of 0.7, but this did not result in the expected accuracy figures. \r\n[The command executed was: $ python3 test.py --cfg yolov3-tiny.cfg --weights yolov3-tiny.pt –img-size 416 –iou-thres 0.7 . Please note that the rest of config settings are based on the default settings of the parameters, e.g. conf-thres -> 0.001]\r\n2.\tIs it required to adjust “Conf-Thresh” argument along with the “IoU-Thresh”, in order to achieve the expected results, for different IoU ranges? Can we fix the “IoU-Thresh” and “Conf-Thresh” settings and still generate the Average-Precision and Average-Recall for different ranges of IoUs?\r\n3.\tThe github site states a different log data than what gets currently displayed; instead of the detailed overall stats for different IoU ranges, I obtained individual class-wise precision figures, for all the 80 classes of COCO-dataset. Is there a mechanism to generate the overall Average Precision and Average Recall logs as stated on the github site?\r\n4.\tLastly, I believe the column-title mAP@0.5 is just a fixed / pre-defined label irrespective of whether the accuracy-value corresponds to IoU @ 0.5 or IoU @ 0.5:0.95.. could this be confirmed?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
