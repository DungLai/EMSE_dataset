Then when you run the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndataset = LoadImages(source, img_size=imgsz)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis should load images with the desired input imgsz. However, the resulting images are not of that size. For example, `zidane.jpg` is of size `(720, 1280)` in (height, width), but the returned image from LoadImages is of shape `(128, 192, 3)`. The reason is because of the `letterbox` function in `LoadImages` which takes in the imgsz of (320,192). However, if that imgsz is (192, 320), which correctly corresponds to (height, width), then the returned result has shape `(192, 320, 3)`.\r\n\r\nIs this expected behavior?\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nInput\r\n```\r\nimgsz = (320, 192)\r\nimg0 = cv2.imread('./data/samples/zidane.jpg')\r\nimg = letterbox(img0, new_shape=imgsz)[0]\r\nprint(img.shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n(128, 192, 3) #this should be resized so the image has 320 in one dimension\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
