I'm interested in a 1-class training and tried the following 2 options as suggested on wiki:\r\n\r\n1. python3 train.py --data data/coco1cls.data --cfg yolov3-spp.cfg --epochs 20 --name 1cls\r\nthe trained best_1cls.pt can detect person from sample images, e.g. data/sample/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n2. python3 train.py --data data/coco1cls.data --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --epochs 20 --name 1clscfg\r\nthe trained best_1clscfg.pt failed to detect anything/person from bus.jpg.\r\n\r\nI tried more epochs but it didn't help. Is it due to the pretrained model used by default as: yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt having 80 classes other than a single class, therefore the new config file yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg caused the failure?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
