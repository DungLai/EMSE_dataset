On my side, I think it's very long (my model isn't very big to take this time to train)\r\n\r\nHyperparameter was default one, I'm using batch size = 4 (> 4 look like to cause CUDA Out of Memore error), my test size is 20% of my 12k images.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this ? Is it normal or to long ? If it's very long, any way to find why ?\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate if I miss some data that can help\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nFlorian","closed_by":{"login":"FlorianRuen","id":13837778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODM3Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13837778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianRuen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianRuen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
