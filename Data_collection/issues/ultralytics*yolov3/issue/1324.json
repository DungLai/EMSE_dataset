Why are giou's hyperparameters so small compared to cls‘s hyperparameters and   obj‘s hyperparameters? Is this the reason for the poor location effect of yolov3? If the target category in the dataset is 6 categories, how should the hyperparameters of giou, clc, and obj be set better?\r\nDo you think it is possible to improve the location effect of yolov3 by increasing the penalty of giou in the calculation of the loss?\r\n\r\nhyp = {'giou': 3.54,  # giou loss gain\r\n       'cls': 37.4,  # cls loss gain\r\n       'cls_pw': 1.0,  # cls BCELoss positive_weight\r\n       'obj': 64.3,  # obj loss gain (*=img_size/320 if img_size != 320)\r\n        }\r\nThanks a lot","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
