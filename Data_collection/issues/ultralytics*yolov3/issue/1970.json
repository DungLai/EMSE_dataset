I am a post graduate student and I am interested in yolo. When I worked on an experiment, I want to use a pretrained Darknet in yolov3. However, when I use \"model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov3', 'yolov3')\" and \"model.children()\", I only find conv and leakyrelu. Theoretically, there should be some resnet, pool or softmax. So I am very confused. Hope to get answers from seniors. Thank you.\r\nThis is the result from model.children().\r\n![疑问](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78414886/188779757-97e8912b-4a7d-4772-b48e-814a2a4c53be.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"jayus777","id":78414886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDE0ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78414886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777","html_url":"https://github.com/jayus777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayus777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
