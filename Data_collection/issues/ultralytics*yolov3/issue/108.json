What the anchors mean? Is it the real pixel values when the input size is 416?\r\n2. How anchors changes according to the input size when training with multi-scale or training with not 416 input size? Let me assume question 1 is correct. For example, when the input size is 608 we should adjust the anchors in the class YOLOLayer(nn.Module) like this:\r\nanchors = [10,13,  16,30,  33,23,  30,61,  62,45,  59,119,  116,90,  156,198,  373,326] * 608 / 416, because the pictures become larger, the anchor also should be. But i can not find any code for this work, it means that we still use the [10,13,  16,30,  33,23,  30,61,  62,45,  59,119,  116,90,  156,198,  373,326] when the input size changes to 608, Is this reasonable? Sorry for my bad english.   - - !
