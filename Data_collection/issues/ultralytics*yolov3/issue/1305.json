So I continued the training based on last.pt.\r\nhowever, those curves are not continuous. Please see the following figure.\r\nI debugged the code, and found that:\r\nin the first epoch of continued training, the LR is not computed according to LR lambda generator, and it is 0.01 always at the first epoch of the continued training.\r\nafter the first epoch of continued training, the LR is computed according to LR lambda generator.\r\nSo, I am considering that scheduler.step() should be run once before the epoch loop(for epoch in range(start_epoch, epochs): ). like this:\r\n```Python\r\nscheduler.step() \r\nfor epoch in range(start_epoch, epochs):\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more question:\r\nfrom my figure below, you might notice that the obj curve and p curve are quite abnormal. obj curve descends very slowly, and p curve almost doesn't ascend after a few epoch.\r\nDo you have any suggestion about how to improve my code or training?\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6227348/84611201-afea3500-aeef-11ea-859c-7fa347de5193.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nArdeal\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
