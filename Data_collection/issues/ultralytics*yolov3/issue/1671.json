Could you explain what changes I would need to perform to run the model inference purely in FP16 during runtime?\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nI am running an object detection and tracking algorithm on Jetson Xavier board. I found that running at FP16 significantly reduces computation time but there is no detection at all. Turning this feature off brings back detections but increases the computation time so much so that the entire system only runs at 10 FPS. I am using YOLOv3 tiny which is trained to detect only 1 class @ 415 by 415 image.\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\nAzmyin ","closed_by":{"login":"Mechazo11","id":44814419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE0NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44814419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11","html_url":"https://github.com/Mechazo11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mechazo11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
