I used the recent repository by the way.\r\nHowever, if I use OpenCV's dnn library, the accuracy is decreased by about 3 %.\r\nthe image sizes, confidence thresholds and nms thresholds are the same.\r\nin opencv:\r\nblob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(img, 1.0/255.0, (640,448), (0,0,0), True, crop=False,ddepth=cv2.CV_32F)\r\nso the depth is float 32, and in detect.py the depth is torch.float32.\r\nI also used (640,640) for blob size above, nothing changed.\r\nI do not know how to solve this, and I did not find the difference in inference.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
