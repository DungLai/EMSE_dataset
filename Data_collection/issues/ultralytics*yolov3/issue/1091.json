I encounter a problem and I need your help~\r\nI use yolov3 to train either from scratch or using pre-trained yolov3.pt on VOC2007. The mAP of each epoch in train.py is inconsistent with that in test.py. I tried 100 epochs and the results is as follows：\r\n![results0422](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41316711/80104296-54fc2780-85a9-11ea-90c9-096cfdf6b8f9.png)\r\nThe P, R and mAP seems not very good. However, when I test the best.pt, the results is much better. The test result is as follows:\r\n![Screenshot_2020-04-23_21-43-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41316711/80105921-c4731680-85ab-11ea-908b-54994a9f9fc1.png)\r\nI'm a little confused why the mAP is always about 0.33 after 50 epochs in train.py, but I run the test.py after 100 epochs the mAP is 0.667. Is there any difference in calculating P/R/mAP between the test.py called after each epoch during training and the test.py I run in the end of training? Or is there any other parameters I need to modify?\r\nThanks a lot in advance for your reply！\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
