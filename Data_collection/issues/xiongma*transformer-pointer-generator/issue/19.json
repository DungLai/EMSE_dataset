Your code is helpful to my recent project, which needs two source inputs(X1 and X2). I need the transformer to attend on two sources, while i only want to copy from source X1. What's your opinion about this? \r\n\r\nA possible solution is that i use two encoders and one decoder. I only feed the encoder outputs of X1 into the last layer of the decoder, otherwise i feed the concatenation outputs of two  encoders for joint attention. Do you think it can work well ? Anything wrong with the solution? \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your insightful opinion!","closed_by":{"login":"ha-lins","id":22448743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQ4NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22448743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins","html_url":"https://github.com/ha-lins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ha-lins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
