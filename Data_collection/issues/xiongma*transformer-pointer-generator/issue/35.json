Recently I'm also trying to re-implement the pointer-generator and transformer-based summarization model. And their are some issues that I want to discuss with you. I try to trainng CNNDM with transoformer(Attention is all you need version):\r\n- I set batch_size=16, lr=0.15 with adagrad just as pointer generator. After training for 27 epoch, the training loss is 3.96 and dev loss is 3.95. Is this normal? And the loss is dereceasing really slow.\r\n- In decoding mode. Which decoding strategy do you think is better? topk-topp or beam-search?\r\n- Are you using label-smoothing is the loss function? I find that lots of similiar code using label-smoothing.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
