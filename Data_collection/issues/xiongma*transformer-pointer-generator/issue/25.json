In your work, the tensor shape is confused, I think the shape (N, T1orT2, d_model) is equal to the model shape (batch_size, max_encoder_step or max_decoder_step, embedding_size) ?\r\n2. When the model in decode stage, I cannot understand the ys, also, what's the shape of self.decoder_inputs?\r\nI'm sorry to bother you, but I really your opinions! \r\nthanks!","closed_by":{"login":"xiongma","id":30991932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkxOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30991932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
