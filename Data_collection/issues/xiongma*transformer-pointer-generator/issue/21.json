I had an idea for the README and wanted to share with you.\r\n\r\nI think the tutorial on the README could be even more useful if it included your code's ROUGE score on the [CNN/DailyMail dataset](http://nlpprogress.com/english/summarization.html) which is the standard for comparing English text summarization models. I've been reading several papers ([example 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf) [example 2](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/custom/15784595.pdf)) on the topic and they all test out their models on this dataset.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be very helpful to include a tutorial on how to run this code on the CNN/DailyMail dataset since I believe the current code is based on Chinese text.\r\n\r\nI am willing to help on this issue if you'd like!","closed_by":{"login":"xiongma","id":30991932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkxOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30991932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
