Run \"python train.py\". I wonder how to  test the trained model with a new text. After I feed the system a new text,  as  expected,  it can output a condensed short text. What are the input and output interfaces for use to exchange data with the software .\r\n\r\nQ2: I tried to  test the project by running \"python train.py\". However I failed due to the limited 6G memory on my PC. Hence, I wonder  which parameters can be reset to allow the project to run successfully on a common PC.","closed_by":{"login":"xiongma","id":30991932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkxOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30991932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xiongma/transformer-pointer-generator/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
