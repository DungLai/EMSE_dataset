This issue might be caused due to a problem in the training of the task network. I recommend to use the shell script 'runner_SNET.sh', or to follow the commands there, with the num_out_points that you want. Specifically, you should train the task network first, in this case, PointNet classifier. Use 'evaluate_classifier.py' to validate that the accuracy of the classifier is like that reported in PointNet paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/comments/607817601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"itailang","id":36666820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36666820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang","html_url":"https://github.com/itailang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3191979846,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE5MTk3OTg0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/events/3191979846","actor":{"login":"itailang","id":36666820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36666820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang","html_url":"https://github.com/itailang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-02T12:32:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/comments/612939348","html_url":"https://github.com/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/5#issuecomment-612939348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/5","id":612939348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjkzOTM0OA==","user":{"login":"ninaqy","id":19339460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzM5NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19339460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy","html_url":"https://github.com/ninaqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninaqy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-13T15:08:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T15:08:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the suggestion.
