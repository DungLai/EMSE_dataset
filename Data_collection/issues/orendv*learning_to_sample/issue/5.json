In Fig 3 with sampling ratio=32, the paper states the accuracy should around 0.60. \r\n\r\nThe same problem is found for progressiveNet, I failed to achieve the paper results by your providing running script.\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether some special training tricks are involved, could you elaborate more on the training procedure? Thank you very much.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"itailang","id":36666820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36666820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang","html_url":"https://github.com/itailang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itailang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/orendv/learning_to_sample/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
