First of all, thank you so much for writing this project and the article on medium explaining the code.\r\n\r\nAs I've read the code, I see that for your data, you build 2 arrays: `questions` and `answers` where `answers[i]` is the response to `questions[i]`. I looked through data files, and although the conversations are broken up to individual lines, the entire movie seems to have a sequential nature to it. What I mean is that, for example, the first 2 lines of the `movie_conversations.txt` have:\r\nu0 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ ['L194', 'L195', 'L196', 'L197']\r\nu0 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ ['L198', 'L199']\r\n\r\nAlthough the lines ['L194', 'L195', 'L196', 'L197'] and ['L198', 'L199'] are separated into 2 conversations, the movie script still has that natural sequence where L197 and L198 still follow one another correspondingly. I suppose the data doesn't specify L198 to be a response to L197 though.\r\n\r\nMy main question is that: I'm using a collection of reddit comments threads, where I have access to trees of comments. So I will have separate conversations where the lines fit with one another, but there won't be any continuation after a comment tree ends like in the movie script. Would this affect the quality of the chat bot? If so, what would the difference be?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"tonyhqanguyen","id":36124849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36124849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/tonyhqanguyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
