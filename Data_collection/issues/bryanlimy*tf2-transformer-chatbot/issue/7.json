Thanks for sharing this implementation and the medium / jupyter notebook material (really great!)\r\n\r\nI was able to run the entire project here, but realized that the prediction implementation takes a long time to execute if MAX_LENGTH is large and has several batches to run. (really long time)\r\n\r\nMy question is if you have any suggestions to optimize, or if anyone has already done so. I thought about doing batch predictions instead of single sentences at a time, but I'm not sure if it will work.\r\n\r\nBest","closed_by":{"login":"arthurflor23","id":11759042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzU5MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11759042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23","html_url":"https://github.com/arthurflor23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurflor23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
