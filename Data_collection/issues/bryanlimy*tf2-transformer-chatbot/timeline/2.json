One major limitation with this current chatbot is that the model won't be coherent throughout a conversation, it doesn't remember what it heard and said in the past. \r\n\r\nSo I think with the reddit dataset you have, it is going to behave similarly to the model trained on the movie corpus (except a lot more swear words and random memes), in the sense that it won't be able to remember what it has said in the past, it only focus on the given input and provide an output.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/comments/497382303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bryanlimy","id":9648242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDgyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9648242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanlimy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanlimy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/comments/497389247","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/2#issuecomment-497389247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bryanlimy/tf2-transformer-chatbot/issues/2","id":497389247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzM4OTI0Nw==","user":{"login":"tonyhqanguyen","id":36124849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI0ODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36124849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/tonyhqanguyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonyhqanguyen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T16:18:57Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T16:29:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see.
