In this case there is further variation because the newer parser models are based on T5, while the demo page runs a BERT-based model. You can also try `benepar_en3_wsj`, which is a BERT-based model.\r\n\r\nThe `benepar_en2` model only works with a prior benepar release (0.1.3). The old release should still work if you pin dependencies appropriately, but it's reached end-of-life and will not be receiving any further maintenance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/1005091780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5842335624,"node_id":"CE_lADOB9LuEc5BF1P0zwAAAAFcOveI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/events/5842335624","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-04T19:04:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/1005455946","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/87#issuecomment-1005455946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/87","id":1005455946,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB9LuEc477gpK","user":{"login":"alexbenari","id":6709803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDk4MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6709803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbenari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbenari/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-05T07:51:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T07:51:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot!
