So I added my own tagger, which only took a very small modification to the parser.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/480851927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/480858686","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/19#issuecomment-480858686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/19","id":480858686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDg1ODY4Ng==","user":{"login":"sahinbatmaz","id":13135252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM1MjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13135252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz","html_url":"https://github.com/sahinbatmaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahinbatmaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T14:36:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T14:36:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot for the answer, it completely makes sense.
