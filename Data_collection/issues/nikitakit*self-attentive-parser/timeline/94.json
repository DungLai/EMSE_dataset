I pay close attention to any github issues that would signal a regression compared to past behavior, and there haven't been any such reports to the tracker. If you see something going on with dependencies, please file an issue with steps for how to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nA better description of the situation is that the job of this package is to implement exactly the parsing method described in my paper, and no further changes are required for that (until something breaks). I take inspiration from the [evalb software](https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/), which basically hasn't changed since 2006 and still does its job just as well today as it did then -- no changes required. It would be wonderful if I could get even a fraction of that shelf life. And if something changes out from under it in terms of dependencies, I'll fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/1294000727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7685453870,"node_id":"CE_lADOB9LuEc5U-D2szwAAAAHKFrgu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/events/7685453870","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-27T19:59:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/1299963952","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/94#issuecomment-1299963952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/94","id":1299963952,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB9LuEc5Ne-Aw","user":{"login":"swetepete","id":100341632,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfsXgA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100341632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete","html_url":"https://github.com/swetepete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swetepete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-02T09:55:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T09:55:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry, my mistake.
