I don't run Windows myself, so I can't know for certain what the issue is.\r\n\r\nAfter some searching I found the following fix for the same error message: https://github.com/ictnlp-wshugen/annotated-transformer_codes/commit/ffe3bcc2665fbe5a7f1d53ca8819b1a455903cb8\r\n\r\nMy guess regarding what's happening is that on Mac/Linux, code such as `torch.from_numpy(np.array([1,2]))` has dtype `long`, but on Windows it has dtype `int` for some reason. I'm guessing the error might go away if you call `.long()` on the indices passed to the embedding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/498689123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/501191822","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/25#issuecomment-501191822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/25","id":501191822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTE5MTgyMg==","user":{"login":"nitedl","id":50877445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODc3NDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50877445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl","html_url":"https://github.com/nitedl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitedl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T09:21:04Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T09:21:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This indeed was the problem.
