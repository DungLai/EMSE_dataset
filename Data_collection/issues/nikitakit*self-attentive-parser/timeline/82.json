Parsing operates over words, while pre-trained use subwords with a bunch of unicode substitution/normalization rules. The parser relies on having the tokenizer provide a mapping between subwords and character positions in the original string. \"Slow\" huggingface tokenizers don't implement this feature, and trying to reconstruct alignments after-the-fact is extremely error-prone due to all of the text normalization involved.\r\n\r\nIf you're using T5-based English parsers and want a solution just for yourself, you can probably modify the tokenization code to use the original sentencepiece library instead of huggingface. But I don't plan on adding such a solution to this repository, because it's not general-purpose and only works for a limited set of pre-trained models. You could also try hacking `retokenization.py` to have multiple tokenizer copies in thread-local storage.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/852641782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
