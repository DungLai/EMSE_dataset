started looking into constituency-to-dependency conversion at some point in the past, but I found that the process wasn't really documented anywhere. The conversion software itself seems to be part of Stanford CoreNLP so it's easy to download, but it accepts a fair number of flags and there have been many versions of CoreNLP over the years.
