I'm always a bit nervous the spaCy integration introduced some sort of error that would be immediately obvious to a speaker of the language. My parser also has a POS tagger (optional but enabled by default), though I'm not sure how good it is compared to the spaCy model you linked.\r\n\r\nI'll update the README with instructions on how to use Hungarian spaCy models. Sadly the tokenizer available via `spacy.blank` is not sufficient for benepar because it doesn't mark sentence boundaries.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/460466540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2129108422,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxMjkxMDg0MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/events/2129108422","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d58e8c43b7af877fa931f53bb5b828953905c1e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/commits/d58e8c43b7af877fa931f53bb5b828953905c1e9","created_at":"2019-02-10T08:45:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/462114942","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/17#issuecomment-462114942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/17","id":462114942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjExNDk0Mg==","user":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-10T08:51:08Z","updated_at":"2019-02-10T08:51:08Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing this now that I've added the link to the README.
