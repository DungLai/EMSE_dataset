I'm sorry that I did not see your post earlier.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed the example you sent on my machine. It's unfortunate that the model is making a mistake in this case.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to taggers, every model is imperfect in its own way. I first started to pay attention this after seeing a consistent pattern of errors when handling imperatives. This was brought to my attention by several users who were trying to use the parser on natural language commands, which seems like a desirable use-case to support out of the box. The NLTK default tagger is notoriously bad at this, to the point where I can't in good faith recommend using the NLTK integration without upgrading to `benepar_en2`. SpaCy is actually quite a bit better, though not perfect -- for example, my copy of `en_core_web_lg` tags \"lower\" as an adverb in the phrase \"lower the blinds.\" Funnily enough `en_core_web_sm` seems to get this right, but it has errors for different imperatives. (I'm using spaCy 2.0.12 -- given how fast the field moves I wouldn't be surprised if newer versions of spaCy have gotten better.)\r\n\r\nIn terms of accuracy numbers, before I released the `benepar_en2` model I did a quick benchmark on WSJ sections 22-24 (part of the Penn Treebank). I'm getting a tagging accuracy of 95.96 with `en_core_web_lg` and 97.30 with `benepar_en2`. Of course, actual accuracy can vary depending on the application. Disclaimer: I haven't made sure that these numbers are comparable to any past published work.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that you're comparing `en_core_web_lg` (the largest of the spaCy models) with `benepar_en2` (the smaller of the English parsers). If you use `benepar_en2_large` instead the three mismatches above all go away.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/483963079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2388292997,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4ODI5Mjk5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/events/2388292997","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T14:14:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
