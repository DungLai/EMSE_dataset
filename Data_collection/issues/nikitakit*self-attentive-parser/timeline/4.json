Sorry if that was unclear. We follow the standard splits: 2-21 for training, 22 for dev, and 23 for test. If you'd like to check any of the details, the code is all in the repo and the command to train the model is in the README (search for `--use-elmo`).\r\n\r\nWhat evaluation are you using that's getting almost 96 F1? I really wish the parser was that accurate, but that isn't the number I've gotten in any of my evaluations. The 95.07 number was produced by evalb (see the `EVALB` directory in the repo) using the `COLLINS.prm` parameter file, and includes sentences of all lengths (not just up to length 40). I know that when I was getting started with parsing it took me a while to track down what the standard evaluation procedure is, especially since most parsing papers aren't very detailed on this point. Is it possible that you're running the evaluation differently?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/409076830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikitakit","id":252225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjIyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitakit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/409089477","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4#issuecomment-409089477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4","id":409089477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTA4OTQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"GaryYufei","id":8288965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8288965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei","html_url":"https://github.com/GaryYufei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T04:18:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T04:18:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply! I am also new to parsing. plus I just want to use the output of your model for my own task.

It seems there is some differences (in terms of formating) with your 22 section output and my WSJ parsing tree.\r\n3) the 95.07 actually comes from the \"Bracketing FMeasure\" right?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/409089477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GaryYufei","id":8288965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8288965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei","html_url":"https://github.com/GaryYufei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/comments/409123314","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4#issuecomment-409123314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4","id":409123314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTEyMzMxNA==","user":{"login":"GaryYufei","id":8288965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8288965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei","html_url":"https://github.com/GaryYufei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T07:28:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T07:28:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nOK.
