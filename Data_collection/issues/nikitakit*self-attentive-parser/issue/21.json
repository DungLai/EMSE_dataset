On further inspection, I'm guessing I need to insert a \"TOP\" tag at the start of every sentence? I did that and the model starts training, but then the EVAL script doesn't work. My copy of the treebank is somehow also missing a sentence. Is this what's causing the problem for the EVAL script? Can I just copy and paste the sentence that's missing from the silver trees you provided?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
