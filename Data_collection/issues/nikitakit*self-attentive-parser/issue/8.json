A couple of questions/comments I have: \r\n\r\n1. [EDIT: never mind]\r\n\r\n2. When using the option `--use-elmo`, I was able to load the weights and everything seems to be running fine, but I get this warning at the beginning: \r\n\r\n> In file included from /atm/turkey/vol/transitory/ttmt001/envs/py3.6-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/ndarraytypes.h:1821:0,\r\n                 from /atm/turkey/vol/transitory/ttmt001/envs/py3.6-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/ndarrayobject.h:18,\r\n                 from /atm/turkey/vol/transitory/ttmt001/envs/py3.6-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/arrayobject.h:4,\r\n                 from /homes/ttmt001/.pyxbld/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/pyrex/thinc/neural/gpu_ops.c:568:\r\n/atm/turkey/vol/transitory/ttmt001/envs/py3.6-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/npy_1_7_deprecated_api.h:15:2: warning: #warning \"Using deprecated NumPy API, disable it by \" \"#defining NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API NPY_1_7_API_VERSION\" [-Wcpp]\r\n #warning \"Using deprecated NumPy API, disable it by \" \\\r\n  ^\r\n/homes/ttmt001/.pyxbld/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6/pyrex/thinc/neural/gpu_ops.c:570:24: fatal error: _cuda_shim.h: No such file or directory\r\n #include \"_cuda_shim.h\"\r\n                        ^\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\n\r\nSo the issue seems to be somewhere in the interaction between allennlp, numpy, and perhaps cython (.pyx)? I'm using a virtual environment (python 3.6) without gpu, so I'm not sure why there's a warning about cuda and gpu_ops. I don't get this warning if I just do `from  allennlp.modules.elmo import Elmo` in the command line (without .pyx dependencies).
