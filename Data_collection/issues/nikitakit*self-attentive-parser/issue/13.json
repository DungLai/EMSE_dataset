To backport several features, I (and so do many) usually use \r\n```\r\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\r\n```\r\nThis means when I import your model `benepar_en_small`, I get an error. \r\n```\r\nparser = BeneparComponent(\"benepar_en_small\")\r\n```\r\n```\r\nException: Argument is neither a valid module name nor a path to an existing file: benepar_en_small\r\n```\r\nThis is because of \r\n```\r\n            if isinstance(name, str) and '/' not in name:\r\n                graph_def = tf.GraphDef.FromString(load_model(name))\r\n```\r\nI think making it `basestring` instead of just `str` can resolve this issue.
