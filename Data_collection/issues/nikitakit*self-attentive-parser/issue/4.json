I installed the parser (\"benepar_en\") using pip and tested its performance the WSJ 23 section. What I found is that, the performance is higher than the number claimed in README (in my side, it shows 95.98 (vs 95.07 in README)). I am wondering if the pre-trained model in pip has used WSJ 23  in training? It seems unclear what is used to train the pip model.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"GaryYufei","id":8288965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8288965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei","html_url":"https://github.com/GaryYufei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaryYufei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
