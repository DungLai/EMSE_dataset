It does not produce (-LRB- -LRB-)/(-RRB- -RRB-) as other standard parsers for cases of parentheticals. For example, parsing this sentence:\r\n\r\n_Representative George Hansen (R., Idaho) drew a reprimand in nineteen eighty-four after a felony conviction for falsifying his financial disclosures._\r\n\r\ngives\r\n\r\n(S\r\n   (NP\r\n    (NP (JJ Representative) (NNP George) (NNP Hansen))\r\n    **(PRN (( () (NP (NNP R.))
