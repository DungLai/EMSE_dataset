Thanks for writing benepar. The web rendering demo is super useful for visualizing sentence structure. It'd be lovely if it was made available as something like `benepar.render()` (inspired from spaCy) for use within Jupyter notebooks, etc. I expect most of the code on the website that does this rendering could be reused as is, too.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
