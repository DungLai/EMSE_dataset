I can't say enough good things about it. Very impressive indeed. \r\n\r\nThat makes these bizarre tagger errors all the more surprising. \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport spacy\r\nspacy.__version__ # '2.1.3'\r\nimport benepar\r\nbenepar.download('benepar_en2')\r\nfrom benepar.spacy_plugin import BeneparComponent\r\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')\r\nsentencizer = nlp.create_pipe(\"sentencizer\")\r\nnlp.add_pipe(sentencizer, first=True)\r\n\r\nbnp = BeneparComponent(\"benepar_en2\")\r\nnlp.add_pipe(bnp, before='parser')\r\nnlp.pipe_names # ['sentencizer', 'tagger', 'benepar', 'parser', 'ner']\r\n\r\ntext = \"Justin O'Mara Brown (born April 16, 1982 in Fletcher, Oklahoma) is a former professional American, Canadian football and arena football defensive end. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Indianapolis Colts in 2005.\" # Wikipedia\r\ndocs = nlp(text, disable=['benepar'])\r\ndocb = nlp(text, disable=['tagger'])\r\n\r\nfor s, b in zip(docs, docb):\r\n    if s.tag != b.tag:\r\n        print(s.i, s.text, s.tag_, b.tag_)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n18 American JJ NNP\r\n20 Canadian JJ NNP\r\n28 He PRP NNP\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all three, spaCy's tagger was right and BNP's was wrong. The third one was the most troubling. With all due respect to the famous mariner Zheng He, it's not very wise to guess that \"He\" at the beginning of a sentence is any thing other than a pronoun. \r\n\r\nWhen I read that \"tagger in models such as benepar_en2 gives better results,\" I actually went out of my way to make sure that BNP's tags are used instead of  spaCy's. Now I'm not so sure. Can you quantify or describe how BNP's tagging is better, please? I don't have time to do an exhaustive test, so your input will carry a lot of weight.  How do you think `benepar_en2` compares with spaCy 2.1.3's `en_core_web_lg` for tagging?\r\n\r\nAgain, I emphasize that these tagging errors in no way detract from the project, which to me is about parsing, and BNP is excellent at that.
