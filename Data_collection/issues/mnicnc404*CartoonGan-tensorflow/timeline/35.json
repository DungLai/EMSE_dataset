I read a blog post about it, and you read the last sentence in your log: \"from tensorflow from tensorflow from tensorflow import keras\", you should be executing The python convert_to_tf_keras.py command many times has caused many prefixes in front of your tensorflow, so the solution I proposed is:\r\n1. Delete your tf_keras_contrib-2.0.8-py3.6.egg file (this file is the thing that you execute the setup.py file installation, mine is installed in this directory ï¼šC: \\ Users \\ 90496 \\ Anaconda3 \\  envs \\ tensorflow \\ Lib \\ site-packages), and be sure to delete the easyinstall.pth file at the same time\r\n2. Re-run your above command, that is, enter the keras-contrib directory and run the following two commands python convert_to_tf_keras.py \\ && USE_TF_KERAS = 1 python setup.py install\r\nHope that can help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/comments/596081930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iwanttobeabigone","id":49444302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDQ0MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49444302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone","html_url":"https://github.com/iwanttobeabigone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwanttobeabigone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/comments/597100843","html_url":"https://github.com/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/35#issuecomment-597100843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/35","id":597100843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzEwMDg0Mw==","user":{"login":"ElegantLin","id":16239478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM5NDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16239478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin","html_url":"https://github.com/ElegantLin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElegantLin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-10T13:59:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T13:59:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, @iwanttobeabigone.
