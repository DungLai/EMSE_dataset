I think all you need is more GPU memory. To inference on a 4K image, I need to run it on 2X 1080TI (22G in total). Of course, you can run on CPU if you don't have enough GPU memory, but it will be way much slower.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/comments/679469538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"edwin-yan","id":10616426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjE2NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10616426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan","html_url":"https://github.com/edwin-yan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwin-yan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/comments/680170279","html_url":"https://github.com/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/26#issuecomment-680170279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/26","id":680170279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDE3MDI3OQ==","user":{"login":"karims","id":1215629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU2Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1215629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims","html_url":"https://github.com/karims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karims/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T17:36:43Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T17:36:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
