If you really want to keep the original size, try GPU with more memory like P100, V100, which you can find at GCP or Azure, etc. We cannot guarantee that you can successfully transfer 1080p image on P100 or V100 since we do not own a P100 or G100 vm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/comments/625727663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mnicnc404","id":2225912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2225912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404","html_url":"https://github.com/mnicnc404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3316273129,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzMxNjI3MzEyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mnicnc404/CartoonGan-tensorflow/issues/events/3316273129","actor":{"login":"mnicnc404","id":2225912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2225912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404","html_url":"https://github.com/mnicnc404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnicnc404/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-08T09:25:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
