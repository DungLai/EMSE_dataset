Our dataset contains crystal structures and corresponding properties. Basically, it can be compared with the MaterialsProject class of schnetapack dataset. Initially, I tried to treat our dataset as a MaterialsProject object. However, it couldn't find the keys(properties) when the setup() method is called though I have modified the Materials Project class. After that, I tried with ASEAtomsData to make it compatible for the neural network model but couldn't run the model due to an inheritance problem(**ValueError: Expected a parent**). \r\n\r\nCould you please suggest any references to run our own dataset with schnetpack models so that I could understand my mistakes?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
