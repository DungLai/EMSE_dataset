If you train with a LR plateau hook, the following happens: After training to convergence, the `Trainer` terminates as expected. Then, if you restore it from the latest checkpoint, it runs *again* for a few more epochs, presumably until the hook triggers again. You can repeat this indefinitely. Is this expected behaviour? \r\n\r\nIf this is not expected, I'd be happy to submit a small PR to fix it -- you simply need to add `self._stop` to the `state_dict`.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
