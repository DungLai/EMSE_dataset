This can not be reached. I think it should be val_loss is smaller than best_current.\r\nThan there is a condition, where it asks if best_current is bigger than best_previous. I think also here it should be reverse.\r\n\r\nMaybe I misunderstood some things. In this case, I would be very happy for a short explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have 2 more questions, which I want to put in this ticket. I hope you can give your opinions.\r\n1. does it make sense to combine warmResarts with ReduceLROnPlateauHook?\r\n2. Did you have experience with a huge amount of space, which is necessary? Have small areas of proteins (10x10x10a) with cutoff 6a. \r\nSchnet has n_atom_basis 64, filters 64, n_interactions 10. A batchsize bigger than 2 seems to big for a 8GB 1080GTX. An increment of the network to 128/128 with Batch_size 1 seems to be the maximum. Have you experience with this and an idea how to handle this? Batch_size of 1 or 2 seems very small. Did I assume a to big network or cutoff maybe? Maybe you can share your experience, which could help me at tuning.","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
