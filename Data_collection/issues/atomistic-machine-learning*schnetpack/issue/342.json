But as I read in the SchNet paper, the MAE of energy for ethanol is only 0.08 kcal/mol. So I'm wondering if I missed something here, and how we can get the accuracy shown in the paper?\r\nMany thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"Sunkworld","id":16474525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc0NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16474525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunkworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
