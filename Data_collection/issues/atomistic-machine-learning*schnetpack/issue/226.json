While training the formation energy per atom, the MAE seems to plateau at 0.6 eV/atom, which is quite a bit worse than the 0.041 eV/atom that I see in the SchNetPack paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00908 I have the code I used to construct the model below. Are the settings I used reasonable and similar for the ones used in the benchmark, or is there something I'm missing? \r\n```\r\nmp = MaterialsProject(\"./mp.db\", load_only=[MaterialsProject.EformationPerAtom], environment_provider=sch.environment.AseEnvironmentProvider(5))\r\n\r\ntrain, val, test = spk.train_test_split(\r\n        data=mp,\r\n        num_train=int(4/5*len(mp)),\r\n        num_val=int(1/5*len(mp)),\r\n        split_file=\"split.npz\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\ntrain_loader = spk.AtomsLoader(train, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)\r\nval_loader = spk.AtomsLoader(val, batch_size=16)\r\n\r\nschnet = spk.representation.SchNet(\r\n    n_atom_basis=128,\r\n    n_filters=128,\r\n    n_gaussians=30,\r\n    n_interactions=6,\r\n    cutoff=5., cutoff_network=spk.nn.cutoff.CosineCutoff\r\n)\r\n\r\noutput = spk.atomistic.Atomwise(n_in=128, property=MaterialsProject.EformationPerAtom)\r\nmodel = spk.AtomisticModel(representation=schnet, output_modules=output)\r\noptimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0001)\r\n\r\nloss = trn.build_mse_loss([MaterialsProject.EformationPerAtom])\r\n\r\nmetrics = [spk.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError(MaterialsProject.EformationPerAtom)]\r\n\r\nhooks = [\r\n    trn.CSVHook(log_path='./', metrics=metrics),\r\n        trn.ReduceLROnPlateauHook(\r\n        optimizer,\r\n        patience=5, factor=0.8, min_lr=1e-6,\r\n        stop_after_min=True\r\n    )\r\n]\r\n\r\ntrainer = trn.Trainer(\r\n    model_path='./',\r\n    model=model,\r\n    hooks=hooks,\r\n    loss_fn=loss,\r\n    optimizer=optimizer,\r\n    train_loader=train_loader,\r\n    validation_loader=val_loader,\r\n)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/226/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
