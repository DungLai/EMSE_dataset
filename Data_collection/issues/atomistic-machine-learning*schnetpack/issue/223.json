However when looking at the ethanol tutorial there isn't a line. In the Ethanol_script.py in this github it does not run due to mse_loss not being part of the package. So In my attempts I defined my loss as:\r\n`loss = trn.build_mse_loss(properties)`\r\nAnd defined the mse_loss to include both forces and energy and the rho potential. I was wondering if this is the correct way to do this. \r\n\r\nAdditionally wondered if you included a script to plot the predicted values vs the real values to a graph.
