have been trying to use the `dev` branch but the training crashes after 1 epoch because `should_rank_save_checkpoint` property has been removed from `TrainingTypePlugin` since Pytorch Lightning 1.6.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if self.trainer.training_type_plugin.should_rank_save_checkpoint:\r\nAttributeError: 'SingleDeviceStrategy' object has no attribute 'should_rank_save_checkpoint'\r\n```\r\n\r\n I think that the corresponding if statement in `_update_best_and_save()` (from `schnetpack.train.callbacks`) should be replaced by `self.trainer.strategy.local_rank == 0`, but you may have a better fix.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBenoit\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
