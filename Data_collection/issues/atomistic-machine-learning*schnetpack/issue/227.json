My MD system has over 600 atoms. I have finished training a model. However, when I use model to try MD simulation, there are two situations: 1. employing \"CPU\" as device, it shows that buffers on device \"cuda\" but model on device \"cpuâ€œ; 2. employing \"cuda\" as device, it shows CUDA out of memory. I want to know why buffers on device \"cuda\" or how to set parallel when performing MD simulations.\r\n Thank you so much!","closed_by":{"login":"jwz360","id":59943807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTQzODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59943807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360","html_url":"https://github.com/jwz360","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwz360/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
