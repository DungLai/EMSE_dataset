I am confusing a bit about this. The results that get when run the code in properties QM9 mu, the results I get must convert to Debye to get the paper results. So, the MAE loss must multiply by 4.803204673 ( Angstrom to Debye). And the MAE is 0.033 in the paper is equal with the loss MAE 0.00687 that get when run code. Am I wrong something?
