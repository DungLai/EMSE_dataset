The naming conventions should be used consistently.","closed_by":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
