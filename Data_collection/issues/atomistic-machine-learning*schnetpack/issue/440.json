Since I can't figure out how to add early stopping in python code, I attempt to modify the .yaml files in schnetpack/src/schnetpack/configs in order to train schnet model with early stopping. Could you please let me know how to add early stopping in python code if it's not too much trouble?\r\n\r\nWhen I use CLI to train models, a TypeError occurred. The process I used to train a SchNet model with CLI is as follows:\r\n\r\nI created two .yaml files in the two folders respectively. The names of the two folders are data and experiment in schnetpack/src/schnetpack/configs. The content of the following two TXT files is the .yaml file I created for the training model\r\n[test_in_data.txt](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/9679898/test_in_data.txt)\r\n[test_in_experiment.txt](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/9679899/test_in_experiment.txt)\r\n\r\nThe command I use is as followsï¼š\r\n`spktrain --config-dir=~/git/schnetpack/src/schnetpack/configs experiment=test_in_experiment.yaml model/representation=schnet > output_test_moldel_task.txt`\r\n\r\nThen, a TypeError occurred. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49906543/193170974-bdfa5493-f665-4730-9aa9-d182a3a87b0b.png)\r\n\r\nThe complete error output is in the following TXT file.\r\n[error_output.txt](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/9679982/error_output.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help you might be able to provide.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nWangzai","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
