I'm trying to use SchNet for modeling extended, periodic systems and have two questions regarding the use of SchNetPack in this case: \r\n\r\n1. is SchNet size extensible - i.e. if I train on a system of N atoms and want to run Molecular Dynamics on a system of M >> N atoms, is that possible with the current version of the code? If not, is it possible in principle? \r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to parallelize SchNetPack over multiple CPUs/GPUs for prediction / Molecular Dynamics (not training, where you can use data parallelism)? This is very helpful for building force-fields of large, extended systems (say 1,000+ atoms). Is that possible in the current version of the code? If not, is it possible in principle or would that not work because the different nodes of the graph need to talk to each other, i.e. it would be hard to parallelize over atomic environments? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nSimon ","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
