I think I'm experiencing a bug in the System class when trying to run a MD simulation with Schnetpack. See the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmd_system = System(1, device=\"cuda\")\r\nmd_system.load_molecules(traj)\r\n```\r\nThis gives a TypeError:\r\n`TypeError: 'SimpleNeighborList' object is not callable`\r\n\r\nThis traces back to lines 180-181 in the \"system.py\" file located in the \"md\" subdirectory:\r\n```        \r\nif self.neighbor_list is not None:\r\n    self.neighbor_list = self.neighbor_list(self)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI'm able to fix this by removing the function call in the second line:\r\n```\r\nif self.neighbor_list is not None:\r\n    self.neighbor_list = self.neighbor_list\r\n```\r\nbut I'm not sure if this is the best way to fix this. I'm actually not share why this error would come up, because I think \r\n```\r\nself.neighbor_list(self)\r\n```\r\ndoes seem necessary for this part of the code to work...\r\nEDIT: I believe this error will only occur if you make a System object and then call \"load_molecules\" twice. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, passing in one molecule into System.load_molecules leads to some problems for some reason. Namely, on line 127\r\n```\r\nself.n_molecules = len(molecules)\r\n```\r\nreturns the number of atoms in the ase.Atoms object instead of the number of molecules, as I guess that's what happens without a list of Atoms objects. This leads to other problems, like on line 134-135:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(self.n_molecules):\r\n     self.n_atoms[i] = molecules[i].get_number_of_atoms()\r\n```\r\nthe for loop is over the number of atoms in the object, making molecules[i] a Atom object instead of Atoms object, which doesn't have the get_number_of_atoms() function.\r\n\r\nI can write a fix for this for my own use, but I wanted to draw this to your attention in case you believe having a fix for this in the main code is worthwhile.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
