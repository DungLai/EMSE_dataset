I just found your tool and wanted to get acquainted with it by reproducing the results for QM9 data. I set the available parameters according to the values given in the articles [_J.Chem.Phys,148,241722(2018)_ and _Adv.N.Inf.Proc.Sys,30 (2017),pp.992-1002_]. The parameter 'an exponential moving average over weights with decay rate 0.99' I set in schnetpack_qm9.py in Adam optimizer (line 185) `\"weight_decay=0.99\"`. \r\nThus, my command is:\r\n`python3  schnetpack_qm9.py train schnet qm9.db output --split 110000 1000 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001 --lr_decay 0.96 --features 64  --cutoff 1000 --cuda `\r\n For the first run, after ~2500 epochs the min RMSE_U0 was 1.2 kcal/mol. For the second run the min. was 2.6 kcal/mol at ~ 100th epoch, after which the RMSE started to increase and turned to NaN at the end. \r\nI would thus appreciate any guidance in parameters setting to obtain published results of 0.3-0.4 kkcal/mol.
