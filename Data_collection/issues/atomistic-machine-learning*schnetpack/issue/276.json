Is it normal to produce any other than these numbers? Or is there a problem with my model or calculator?\r\n\r\nOutput follow:\r\nTime[ps]      Etot[eV]        Epot[eV]              Ekin[eV]    T[K]\r\n0.0000     -2012735.707 -2012742.375        6.668    99.2\r\n0.0005     -2012736.190 -2012751.500       15.310   227.8\r\n0.0010     -2012736.983 -2012771.500       34.517   513.5\r\n0.0015     -2012737.352 -2012791.250       53.898   801.9\r\n0.0020     -2012737.720 -2012804.750       67.030   997.2\r\n0.0025     -2012738.572 -2012810.750       72.178  1073.8\r\n0.0030     -2012738.591 -2012810.875       72.284  1075.4\r\n0.0035     -2012739.145 -2012808.250       69.105  1028.1\r\n0.0040     -2012740.005 -2012804.750       64.745   963.2\r\n0.0045     -2012740.307 -2012802.250       61.943   921.6\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance","closed_by":{"login":"otayfuroglu","id":13763583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYzNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13763583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu","html_url":"https://github.com/otayfuroglu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otayfuroglu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
