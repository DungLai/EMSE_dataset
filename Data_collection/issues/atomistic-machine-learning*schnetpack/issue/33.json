I noticed that when using `--cuda` on my Titan V it has very very low GPU utilization. It uses around 10GB of GPU memory but is practically 90% of the time at 0% GPU utilization with some very short spikes in between (of around a second) where it seems to compute. I tried it with the QM9 and ANI1 examples. QM9 has slightly better utilization than ANI1 but still around 60-70% idle.\r\n\r\nHave you also noticed such behavior?","closed_by":{"login":"stefdoerr","id":7935362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7935362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr","html_url":"https://github.com/stefdoerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefdoerr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
