Some of the arguments, like `property`, are general arguments, not training arguments, however, if the model was trained for a certain property it makes little sense to evaluate it on another, right?\r\n\r\nThen in line 308 and 310, the `train_args` are set to `args` or loaded from the json file created when training the model, however at some points it seems a bit arbitrary when `train_args` or `args` are used, e.g. in line 314 when the qm9 dataset is loaded, `train_args.property` is used, but then below when the atomref is loaded, `args.property` is used instead. \r\n\r\nI also noticed that `pool_mode` has disappeared from the arguments, but I assume it is still relevant to set this to `'avg'` instead of `'sum'` for properties like LUMO, so could that be added back in (or set automatically depending on the property)?","closed_by":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
