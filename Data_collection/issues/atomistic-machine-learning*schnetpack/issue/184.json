I think there is a bug in the TorchEnvironmentProvider, but of course it could also be due to my incompetence :-) \r\n\r\nI provide for you a minimal working example showing the substantially different behavior of the ASE and Torch providers for the environment of atom with index 0 for my system of interest. In addition I computed the environment also by an easy Numpy based routine.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, you can shed light to this rather strange behavior of the TorchEnvironmentProvider.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nJohannes\r\n\r\n[mwe.tar.gz](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/3854633/mwe.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
