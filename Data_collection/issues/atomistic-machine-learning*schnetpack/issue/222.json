I found [Trained model](https://schnetpack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getstarted/benchmarks.html#trained-models) in the documents of SchNet. But when I run it , I found somethings wrong with the split.npz file. When setting of the training in ***args.json*** file, **remove_uncharacterized** is set to be true, the size of the qm9.db must be 130831 mols. But the total idx in split file is 133885 (the fullsize). And when I run the model eval on this idx of the test db, the loss is much less than the one reported in the papers. So I think some mistakes in the ***split.npz*** file.\r\nCould you help me, plz?\r\nPlease answer me soon! Thank you so much!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
