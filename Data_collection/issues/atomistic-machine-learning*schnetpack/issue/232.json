The line should be inserted in the calculate function below the first call of the original calculator (\"Calculator.calculate(self, atoms)\"). The remaining part of the function should be indented, so it is only executed if the additional line returns True.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
