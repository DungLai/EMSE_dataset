I get a value of the loss function for the first image then the function just returns `nan`. Not sure what the problem is here, is there a better way to include forces in the loss function? or is there a bug somewhere.","closed_by":{"login":"Dankomaister","id":14222532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister","html_url":"https://github.com/Dankomaister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
