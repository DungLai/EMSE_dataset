Say, when we build data, we can invoke `AtomsData('water_en.db', available_properties=['energy','forces'],\r\n                    environment_provider =  AseEnvironmentProvider(5)))`\r\nWhen we load data, we can set cutoff by `data = MD17('../mydata.db',environment_provider= AseEnvironmentProvider(5))`\r\nAlso, we can set cutoff in \r\n```\r\nschnet = spk.representation.SchNet(\r\n    n_atom_basis=n_features,\r\n    n_filters=n_features,\r\n    n_gaussians=25,\r\n    n_interactions=3,\r\n    cutoff=5.,\r\n    cutoff_network=spk.nn.cutoff.CosineCutoff\r\n)\r\n```\r\nJust wonder how these three different ways (especially the last two) of setting cutoff would affect the training. I am asking because I thought setting `cutoff` would accelerate the training. However, I found that the training is slowed down by ~20% if I use `data = MD17('../mydata.db',environment_provider= AseEnvironmentProvider(5))`, although I also found that the corresponding convergence is much faster.","closed_by":{"login":"neojie","id":44279474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjc5NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44279474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie","html_url":"https://github.com/neojie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
