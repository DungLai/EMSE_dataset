Parallelization in pytorch works by distributing mini-batches to different GPUs, which is easy to do during training. However, in standard MD one usually has a single molecule. In order to compute this on more than one GPU, the systems would need to be split in different fragments, which then need to be evaluated independently. \r\nThis could be done for e.g. Behler type symmetry functions but in descriptors like SchNet the atoms interact with each other across multiple layers and the system cannot be split in straightforward manner anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/641263351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/641264920","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/227#issuecomment-641264920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/227","id":641264920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTI2NDkyMA==","user":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T12:40:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T12:40:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Out
