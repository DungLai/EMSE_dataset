The neighbor list issue does indeed happen when calling the `load_molecules` routine twice. Once the molecules are loaded the neighbor list is already initialized leading to the error. We are currently working on a release where we have moved the neighbor list to the calculator, which will solve this issue.\r\nRegarding the `load_molecules` function, it expects a list of `ase.Atoms` (or trajectory) as input. It is done this way, because several molecules can be simulated in parallel when using the GPU. If you want to simulate a single molecule, it should be packed into a list e.g. `[mol]`. We could add a check to do this automatically, if this would help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/590762321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/590895205","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/212#issuecomment-590895205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/212","id":590895205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDg5NTIwNQ==","user":{"login":"jstoppelman","id":30512460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTEyNDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30512460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman","html_url":"https://github.com/jstoppelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T14:32:09Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T14:32:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, I just thought of making a list to contain the singular `ase.Atoms` object myself and that should fix things.
