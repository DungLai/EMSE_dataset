@Dankomaister ,\r\nsorry for the late reply!\r\nI had a look at the train method and I think I found the issue.\r\nDuring training and during validation, the computational graph is created. The difference between training and validation is, that the training loop calls `loss.backward()` for the optimization. This also frees the graph and reduces the memory allocation. Since the validation loop does not call `loss.backward()`, the graph is not freed when the next batch is forwarded through the model.\r\nFor models which are not trained on forces the validation loop could be computed with `torch.no_grad()`, but if forces are needed the graph is also needed.\r\nNevertheless I tried to detach the results (`val_result = {k: v.detach() for k, v in val_result.items()}`) and this reduces the allocated memory before the next batch is forwarded through the model. I created a new branch for this issue. What do you think about

@Stefaanhess ,\r\nDetaching the val results sounds like a good solution, I will test and see how well it works.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I suggested to set `create_graph = False` during validation is that I have a script that I'm using to evaluate the predicted energies, forces and stress of a trained model against a .db file.\r\nIn this script I load a trained model using `model = load_model(model_file)` and evaluate it using the `evaluate_dataset` function from from `schnetpack.utils`.\r\nWhat I found out is that if I set `model.output_modules[0].create_graph = False` after loading the model my memory usage during evaluation reduces from 7120MiB to 4856MiB for the same batch size and .db file.\r\nThe model is trained on energy, forces and stress and the predicted quantities are the same before and after setting  `model.output_modules[0].create_graph = False`\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but I thought that the computational graph is only required when performing backpropagation during training? and is not required when predicting?\r\nMaybe it would be a good idea to implement a method to \"freeze\" a model after training, which optimizes the trained model for use only for predictions?\r\n/Daniel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/773815014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dankomaister","id":14222532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister","html_url":"https://github.com/Dankomaister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4294456740,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI5NDQ1Njc0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4294456740","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-05T06:08:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4294456743,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyOTQ0NTY3NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4294456743","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-05T06:08:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/775922032","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/250#issuecomment-775922032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/250","id":775922032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTkyMjAzMg==","user":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/us

@Dankomaister ,\r\nyou are right! ``create_graph=True`` is only needed for the backward pass. Maybe we can make use of the ``model.train()`` and ``model.eval()`` functions. In this case, the model will only create the graph in train mode. For the evaluation and the validation set, the model can be set to eval-mode. What do you think? I will talk to the others about
