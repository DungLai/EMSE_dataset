You basically need to change all entries containing the number of atoms as an dimension, which are exactly the ones you listed.\r\n2) The sizes are correct, `_neighbors` has the dimension `n_atoms x n_neighbors`, which for the standard environment provider reduces to `n_atoms x n_atoms-1` (no double counting of the central atom). `_cell_offset` is similar.\r\n3) This was just in case you only wanted to reformat the data for analysis.\r\n4) It should not affect other parts of the code, as long as the `_atom_mask` and `_neighbor_mask` are set properly, which is done automatically in `_collate_aseatoms`. You could run into problems with this approach if you want to model properties which contain the number of atoms in their shape (e.g. forces with `n_atoms x 3`).
