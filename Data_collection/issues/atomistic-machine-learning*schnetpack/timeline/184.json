In every MD step (at least by using ASE) the environment is recalculated from scratch which means that the distances to all atoms have to be recalculated which should scale quadratic. Making use of neighborlists here should give massive speedups (at least for larger systems) and a better scaling behavior. I am working on a custom LAMMPS version which makes use of the LAMMPS neighborlist and calculates the environment on the C/C++ level and passes this information then to python, calculates energy and forces and passes this back. In principle it is already working but needs more testing and polishing.
