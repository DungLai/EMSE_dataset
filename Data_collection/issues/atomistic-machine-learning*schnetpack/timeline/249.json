Do you have any suggestion how I can run my model on multiple GPU or how did you run on multiple GPU or split your test models?

It consumes almost 31GB GPU RAM (I had a chance to run my model on Tesla V100 and saw this amount of RAM when the model was running). I can send the entire model via email or add a Google Drive link here if you want to take a look.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help.

@MiracAydin1 ,\r\nit should be possible to train the model on multiple GPUs. Therefore you would only need to use the `nn.DataParallel` module (like you already did). On my GPUs this works fine, so I am not sure what is happening with your GPUs. Could you maybe also add the full Traceback of the `RuntimeError: CUDA error: CUBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR when calling cublasCreate(handle)` -error?\r\nI only wanted you to test the `nn.Linear` so I could see if simple modules work on multiple GPU on your system, or if it only causes trubble with our model. Of course the linear layer can not handle the spk-inputs, since it expects tensors. You would need to run something like\r\n\r\n    import torch\r\n    import torch.nn as nn\r\n\r\n    model = nn.Linear(10, 10)\r\n    model = nn.DataParallel(model).to(\"cuda\")\r\n    model(torch.rand(5, 10).to(\"cuda\"))\r\n\r\nin order to check if it runs well.\r\nIn case you want to already want to run your training while we figure out what is going on with the parallel training you could try to reduce the batchsize, in order to run it on the single V100. We use a batchsize of 32 for pbc data. I think this should fit on the V100. I also noticed that you should set `aggregation_mode=\"avg\"` in the output layer, and `divide_by_n_atoms=False` in the statistics calculation. Otherwise your model will not train very well. From my experience I would also suggest to use a smaller lr_patience (e.g. 15), otherwise your training will take very long :)\r\n\r\nBest

@Stefaanhess,\r\n\r\nThank you for your advices.\r\n\r\nI tried your sample code but it gave the same error. Probably system configuration (CUDA and pyTorch versions etc.) and architecture confliction cause this problem. But i have not figured it out yet. We can say that the error is not caused by Schnetpack.\r\n\r\nLastly, could you please write your PyTorch, Python and CUDA version on your system which is currently running fine? Maybe I can try that version to maintain consistency.\r\n\r\nAfter writing your versions, we can close the ticket.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMiraç","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/805307367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MiracAydin1","id":64257834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjU3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64257834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1","html_url":"https://github.com/MiracAydin1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiracAydin1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4498828830,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ5ODgyODgzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4498828830","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-23T22:25:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4498828833,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0OTg4Mjg4MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4498828833","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-23T22:25:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/805668762","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/249#issuecomment-805668762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/249","id":805668762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTY2ODc2Mg==","user":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/re
