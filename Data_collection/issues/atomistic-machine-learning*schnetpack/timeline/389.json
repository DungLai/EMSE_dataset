Is this correct?\r\n\r\nThat is correct. Regarding `_cell` and `_pbc` properties, when a new dataset is created from ASE `Atoms`, both properties should be taken from the `Atoms` object automatically.\r\n\r\n> For running MD simulations, is PBC supported in the current master branch via the SchNetPack-MD package?\r\nIf so, is it enough to include the 'Lattice' and 'pbc' info in the extended XYZ file of the initial structure, and perhaps setting the 'neighbor_list: ase' in the calculator section of the MD conf file?\r\n\r\nPBCs are supported in the current master branch. The steps are as you described. `Lattice` and `pbc` need to be included in the extended XYZ input and the neighborlist should be set to ASE. \r\n\r\nIt is also possible to add a barostat to the simulations. For this, stress tensor computation needs to be enabled in the calculator with the `stress_handle` and `stress_conversion` keywords in the `calculator` block. In SchNetPack models the default label for stress is `stress`, e.g.\r\n```\r\ncalculator:\r\n...\r\n  stress_handle: stress\r\n  stress_conversion: eV/Angstrom/Angstrom/Angstrom\r\n```\r\nFor the barostat, two options are available: isotropic `nhc_iso` and anisotropic `nhc_aniso` Nose-Hover barostats with built in thermostats. The entry in the dynamics block could e.g. look like this:\r\n```\r\n  thermostat: null\r\n  barostat:\r\n    type: nhc_iso\r\n    target_pressure: <x / bar>\r\n    temperature: <x / K>\r\n    time_constant: <x/  fs>\r\n    time_constant_cell: <x / fs>\r\n    time_constant_barostat: <x / fs>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Are MD simulations with PBC possible using ASE interface?\r\n\r\nThey are not possible with the `AseInterface` class, however the `SpkCalculator` can be used with PBCs in ASE routines.\r\nFor this, the `environment_provider` should be changed to ASE and the `stress` and `stress_units` arguments need to be set properly.
