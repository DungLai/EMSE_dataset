I preprocessed the molecules with HTMD and then once I convert them into ASE atoms they have a non defined cell and pbc=False. For the trypsin case, I read it directly from the pdb using ASE and all properties were automatically defined. So the reason I could observe the same behaviour for the QM9 data set is that these molecules also don't have defined cells. So might be worth it to implement a check or something in case someone uses that option I don't know...\r\n\r\nSo in the end with the cells correctly defined it worked using the AseEnvironmentProvider, but was roughly 3x slower than my TorchAniEnvironmentProvider( ~144s/epoch with ASE, ~47s/epoch TorchAni on 3k samples on a TitanV).\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested I could help out a bit with that. I'm also going to Berlin in June for the MolKin conference, so we could talk a bit more about this.\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/482620740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dom1L","id":20482947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDgyOTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20482947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L","html_url":"https://github.com/Dom1L","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dom1L/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2272832468,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI3MjgzMjQ2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/2272832468","actor":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-12T15:36:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2272832470,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNzI4MzI0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/2272832470","actor":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-12T15:36:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/482695533","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/96#issuecomment-482695533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/96","id":482695533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjY5NTUzMw==","user":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T19:30:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T19:30:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","bod

PR contains an environment provider based on the neighborpair implementation of TorchANI. I was talking about it in issue #96. It can be used either on a CPU or GPU and provides a speedup compared to the ASE implementation (tested on a TitanV with a 352 atom structure):\r\n- 16.3 ms Torch\r\n- 1.12 s ASE\r\nThe switch to numpy after the calculation of the indices does not seem to bother the speed, as I also tried a Torch version of this.\r\n\r\nA downside is that it requires a fairly new Pytorch version that contains new functions (for example cartesian products). I used Pytorch 1.1.0.dev20190411 for this one. So one would need to add that to the requirements to pass the tests. I didn't do it because I wasn't sure how you want to handle that.\r\n\r\nI also added the TorchEnvironmentProvider to the existing tests for the environments and made sure it passes them. However, the returned neighborlists are sorted in contrast to the ASE ones, so that might trigger some asserts when testing with larger structures. I am also not an expert with neighborlists, so I'm not sure whether the different Torch and ASE implementations cause any problems. But as it is right now, it might be a nice option to have.\r\n\r\nHope it helps and if there is anything else let me know","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
