tried evaluating the stress tensor on my dataset of periodic structures (diamond and lonsdaleite) and after only a few epochs (training on energy and forces) I was able to reach a MAE in the stress tensor below 0.1 eV/Å^3 (interestingly the MAE in the stress tensor show sign of overfitting while the energy and force MAE are continuously decreasing).\r\n\r\nI did however run into a problem. I’m using ASE to create my dataset by reading results from VASP (vasprun.xml). The issue is that ASE only saves the symmetric stress tensor in Voigt order (xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy) not the full stress tensor (which I assume schnetpack is modelling?).\r\n\r\nI solved that problem by simply replacing the `atoms._calc.results['stress'] array` with the full 3x3 stress tensor read from vasprun.xml but I ran into another issue. When ASE saves the `atoms._calc.results['stress']` array to the .db file it flattens the array. This is a problem since the dimensionality of the stress tensor from schnetpack (3x3) is then different from what is read from the .db file (9x1) which results in errors when calculating metrics (`MeanAbsoluteError`).\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by simply reshaping the stress array in the `add_batch` function in the `MeanAbsoluteError` metric class. However, I feel that this is not the best solution, does anyone have a better solution for getting the full stress tensor correctly written to the .db file using ASE?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/576583575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dankomaister","id":14222532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister","html_url":"https://github.com/Dankomaister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/577098984","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/165#issuecomment-577098984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/165","id":577098984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzA5ODk4NA==","user":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T09:49:03Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T09:49:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Glad to hear the stress tensor seems to work. We use the full (symmetric) 3x3 tensor in SchNetPack.\r\n\r\nRegarding your problem, if you just want to generate the database for training, you could also create a custom `AtomsData` dataset, where you add the stress tensor as an extra property. E.g. by adding to the properties dict in  `add_system(atoms, **properties)`. In general, we store all the properties into the additional `data` entry of the ASE db, since we encountered similar problems to yours when trying to use the ASE Atoms functionality.\r\n\r\nI don't know how helpful this is, but it seems like one can disable the Voigt order in `atoms.get_stress` via `voigt=False`.\r\n\r\nAnd it also seems that ASE expects the Voigt stress convention in the calculator output, so I will have to change this in the calculator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/577098984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/577130678","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/165#issuecomment-577130678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/165","id":577130678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzEzMDY3OA==","user":{"login":"Dankomaister","id":14222532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister","html_url":"https://github.com/Dankomaister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T11:07:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T11:07:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the suggestion!\r\n\r\nI will think about what the best solution is. Since SchNetPack returns the 3x3 symmetric stress tensor I can just convert it to an 1D array in Voigt order.
