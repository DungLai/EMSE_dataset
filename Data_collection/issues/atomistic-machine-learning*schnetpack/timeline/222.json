am reproducing the results in the QM9 dataset. I found the  trained benchmark-models in the document. But when I saw closer, I found that the split.npz file of the qm9 dipole moment does not match with the dataset. In the args.json, I see the ***remove_uncharacterized*** param is true so the total molecules in QM9 is 130831. But the total index in the ***split.npz*** file is 133885. So I think the split file is not match with the setting of model. Could you check it again.\r\nThank you so much!\r\nBest wishes!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/609830704","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/222#issuecomment-609830704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/222","id":609830704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTgzMDcwNA==","user":{"login":"linhlpv","id":33130456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTMwNDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33130456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv","html_url":"https://github.com/linhlpv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhlpv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T14:30:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:31:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @Stefaanhess \r\nThank you so much!

The correct line to reproduce the paper results is:\r\n\r\n`python ./G-SchNet/gschnet_qm9_script.py train gschnet ./data/ ./models/gschnet/ --cuda --split 50000 5000`\r\n\r\nThis will use 50k molecules as training set, 5k for validation, and the remaining ~78k are reserved as a test set.\r\nLet me know if you're running into any other problems when reproducing the results!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/615088105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NiklasGebauer","id":2736079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2736079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer","html_url":"https://github.com/NiklasGebauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasGebauer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3243152093,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI0MzE1MjA5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3243152093","actor":{"login":"hsukiang","id":19194613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTk0NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19194613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang","html_url":"https://github.com/hsukiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T07:23:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3243152095,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNDMxNTIwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3243152095","actor":{"login":"hsukiang","id":19194613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTk0NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19194613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang","html_url":"https://github.com/hsukiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsukiang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-17T07:23:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3756792497,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc1Njc5MjQ5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3756792497","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-11T15:27:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
