In order to run the tutorial in a reasonable amount of time on a normal laptop, it uses reduced settings (only 300 epochs, lr_patience=5, ...). The training also takes just 10 minutes according to the tutorial, while the SchNetPack paper results take at least some hours on a GPU.\r\nIn order to reproduce the paper results I would recommend to use the 'spk_train.py' script with the MD17 settings. This should give better results. If you change the settings in the tutorial you should also get better results, but it will also take more time to train the model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/934322968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5410076258,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCMZ5Ls48b40IzwAAAAFCdzZi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5410076258","actor":{"login":"Sunkworld","id":16474525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc0NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16474525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunkworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-05T11:30:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5410076259,"node_id":"SE_lADOCMZ5Ls48b40IzwAAAAFCdzZj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5410076259","actor":{"login":"Sunkworld","id":16474525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc0NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16474525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunkworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunkworld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-05T11:30:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5410077300,"node_id":"CE_lADOCMZ5Ls48b40IzwAAAAFCdzp0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5410077300","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-05T11:30:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comm
