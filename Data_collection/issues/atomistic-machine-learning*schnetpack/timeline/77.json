I am confident now that they are correct and that there is no conversion error. I still had the predicted values stored.

Maybe due to the small batches. It would be great if this works now reliably in SchNetPack. \r\n\r\nI am still not sure what the problem with the spatial extent is. With SchNetPack, I get similar values as you get. In the paper, I used 64 features and no cutoff. Also the weight initialization was slightly different. At some point the weights of the last layers of the interaction residual were initialized to zero. This could also slightly affect the other results since I changed this only recently. \r\n\r\nMy current theory is that r^2 needs a larger cutoff.

I also added the possibility of the choosing a cosine cutoff function to the scripts, since this is what we are now. Here are the validation errors:\r\n\r\n| Property | cutoff | cutoff_function (PR #91) | Validation error |\r\n|------------|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|\r\n| U0 | 5 Å | hard | 0.0114 eV |\r\n| U0 | 5 Å | cosine | 0.0078 eV |\r\n| R^2 | 20 Å | hard | 0.0084 Bohr^2 |\r\n\r\nHere are argument files:\r\n[U0_hard](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/3037595/U0_args.txt)\r\n[U0_cutoff.txt](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/3037598/U0_cutoff.txt)\r\n[R2_args.txt](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/files/3037601/R2_args.txt)\r\n\r\nI.e., now running schnetpack should reproduce the paper results close enough. Of course changing batch size, learning rate schedule makes some difference, but especially since we get much better results with the cosine cutoff (at least for U0, we need to check with the other properties), I wouldn't take it too seriously. \r\n\r\n\r\nI created an issue to pick up on your suggestion of putting benchmark results in the docs. Thank you for this! We are working towards the next stable release at the moment, so we will create them whenever we're releasing.
