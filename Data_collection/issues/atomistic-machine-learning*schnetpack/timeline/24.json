comments on this:\r\n\r\n1. I added a new variable 'element_wise = False' to the add_batch methods. This sould be set to True if the model_output is an element wise property (forces, positions, ...). This updates n_entries in such a way that the ghost atoms are ignored.\r\n2. I was not shure how to deal with the MaeHeatmap metric. From my perspective this only makes sense for datasets with the same Molecule? I implemented a warning, that checks if different sized molecules occur in the batch.\r\n3.
