think I have a fix for the angular symmetry functions and I made a pull request for it. It seems that it is really expensive as it looks at N_atoms^2 neighbor pairs. I am not sure whether my implementation is compatible with GPU, Also, I am wondering whether there is tutorial of how to use GPU for schnetpack?

It works on GPU and CPU and appears to be stable for gradients. The scaling of the angular functions is always a problem. Avoiding this is one of the advantages of SchNet. \r\n\r\nFor running on GPU it should be enough to change your example script to contain:\r\n`device = torch.device('cuda')`\r\n`model = atm.AtomisticModel(reps, output,elements=frozenset([46,79])).to(device)`\r\n\r\nSorry again for the delay, we were quire busy but now things should be back to
