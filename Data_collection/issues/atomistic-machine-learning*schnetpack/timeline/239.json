Stefan,\r\n\r\n> I am not sure why someone would train a model until convergence and then run trainer.train() again, without changing the lr-settings :D\r\n\r\nThat's a good question ðŸ˜† ! In my case, I was just testing some automation on top of `Trainer` and was confused that it kept running after converging initially. I would expect the `Trainer` to either be finished or not, independently of whether it was restored from a checkpoint, so running `.train()` should run at most one step before finishing again. \r\n\r\nThanks for explaining the idea behind not saving `_stop`! In my case, the actual culprit is the `EarlyStoppingHook`, which I was also using, but forgot to mention. (I'm using the plateau hook without its `min_lr` option, so it's not responsible for terminating the training.)\r\n\r\nThe `EarlyStoppingHook` doesn't save the `best_loss` to its own `state_dict`, so when it gets restored, it automatically resets its counter to 0 (since it initialises with `best_loss = float(\"inf)`). Therefore, a recovered `Trainer` with early stopping will always run for at least the `patience` of the hook. Would you consider this a bug? I guess in some cases it might be preferable to get \"another chance\" at training further, but maybe the correct way to achieve that is to modify the hooks?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/703660018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sirmarcel","id":1615910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTU5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1615910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel","html_url":"https://github.com/sirmarcel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirmarcel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/703744333","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/239#issuecomment-703744333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/239","id":703744333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzc0NDMzMw==","user":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-05T16:31:04Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T16:31:04Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey Marcel,\r\n\r\n> The EarlyStoppingHook doesn't save the best_loss to its own state_dict, so when it gets restored, it automatically resets its counter to 0 (since it initialises with best_loss = float(\"inf)).

Kristof and Stefan! Really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n@Stefaanhess: If you're having a look anyways, I think there's a bug in the `Trainer` state restoration: [This line](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/blob/cd8bc502323a0f3c785dba8a3efe4eaae0002686/src/schnetpack/train/trainer.py#L114) should be using `state_dict` instead of `self.state_dict`, otherwise the hook state gets lost on recovery. :) \r\n\r\nThis fix, and adding `best_loss` to the `EarlyStoppingHook` `state_dict` mostly fix the restart problem for me: now the `Trainer` runs for just one epoch.
