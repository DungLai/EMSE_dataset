If you want to specify a single cpu you could use `x.to(\"cpu:0\")` and for Multiple CPUs you could checkout the `DistributedDataParallel` -module from pytorch. They had a `DistributedDataParallelCPU` in earlier versions (e.g. 1.0) but it is missing in the recent torch versions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStefaan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/805691404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4501038393,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDUwMTAzODM5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4501038393","actor":{"login":"norlandn","id":81276821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjc2ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81276821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn","html_url":"https://github.com/norlandn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-24T10:26:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4501038399,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1MDEwMzgzOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/4501038399","actor":{"login":"norlandn","id":81276821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjc2ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81276821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn","html_url":"https://github.com/norlandn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-24T10:26:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/809852121","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/273#issuecomment-809852121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/273","id":809852121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwOTg1MjEyMQ==","user":{"login":"norlandn","id":81276821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjc2ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81276821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn","html_url":"https://github.com/norlandn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norlandn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T02:13:55Z","update
