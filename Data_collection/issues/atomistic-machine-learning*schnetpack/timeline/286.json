it is a very nice work. However, I have some questions w.r.t the results on MD17 dataset, which I didn't find in the papers. First, what's the cutoff radius for this dataset? Second, is the benchmark of energy the MAE per molecule or the MAE per atom? And is that of forces the MAE per molecule or MAE per atom, or MAE per atom per component? If the results are MAE per molecule, when the framework applied on supercell of a crystal, maybe the MAE will be very large, since the number of atoms is very large. These make me confused.
