Although it is not possible to directly pass the `Atoms` object, since the model needs some additional information e.g. neighbors, ..., the computation of the required properties can be done with the `spk.data.AtomsConverter(environment_provider=XXX)`. The converter will transform your `Atoms` to an input directory for the model. Afterwards just wrap your `Atoms` in the converter for your predictions: `model(converter(atoms=atoms))`\r\nYou will also need to use the same `EnvironmentProvider` as you have during your training in order to get good results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/957973591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5557089169,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCMZ5Ls4-I4tBzwAAAAFLOnOR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5557089169","actor":{"login":"wuziqi-cmu","id":88000636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDAwNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88000636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu","html_url":"https://github.com/wuziqi-cmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-02T17:31:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5557089175,"node_id":"SE_lADOCMZ5Ls4-I4tBzwAAAAFLOnOX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5557089175","actor":{"login":"wuziqi-cmu","id":88000636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDAwNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88000636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu","html_url":"https://github.com/wuziqi-cmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-02T17:31:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/958612581","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/363#issuecomment-958612581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/363","id":958612581,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMZ5Ls45I0Rl","user":{"login":"wuziqi-cmu","id":88000636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDAwNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88000636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu","html_url":"https://github.com/wuziqi-cmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuziqi-cmu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T02:52
