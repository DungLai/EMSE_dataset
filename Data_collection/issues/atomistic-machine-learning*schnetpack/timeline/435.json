You can add them for the data properties when you create your dataset:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# calculate this at the same level of theory as your data\r\natomref = {\r\n'energy': [0.0, 0.5, ... ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n# the supplied list is ordered by atomic number, e.g.:\r\natomref_carbon= atomref['energy'][6]\r\n\r\ndataset = ASEAtomsData.create(\r\n    './test.db',\r\n    distance_unit='Ang',\r\n
