To your questions:\r\n\r\n1. SchNet is fully size extensive. You can easily train on smaller systems and then perform the prediction on larger ones. We use the typical atomistic network structure, where the total energy is a sum of atomic energies, which are functions of the atoms environment.\r\n2. Due to the graph like structure, a single prediction procedure is hard to parallelize. It either involves large regions of the molecule or a lot of bookkeeping. The good news is, depending on the RAM of your GPU (~12GB), energy/force predictions should still be possible for systems up to 10k atoms. Constructing the neighborlist might be a bottleneck though.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/594449276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/594600699","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217#issuecomment-594600699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217","id":594600699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDYwMDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"neojie","id":44279474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjc5NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44279474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie","html_url":"https://github.com/neojie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neojie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T15:28:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T15:28:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Regarding the scalability or extensibility, I tried using SchNet to train a small ionic silicate system (4 formula unit MgSiO3 melt, MD simulations at P, T using VASP, system size 6.9A*6.9A*6.9A, cutoff is set as 5 A) and get quite small MAE (energy < 0.01 eV, force <0.05 eV/A). I applied the best fitting model to the a bigger system (16 formula unit MgSiO3 melt, , MD simulations at the same P, T using VASP) and get super big errors for both energy and force, especially for energy. One thing I notice that the  energy predicted is always small than that of calculated by VASP, indicating that the small system model under-counting the total energy. I think there are several sources for the bad scalability. The major one may be that Schnet does not explicitly consider the long range Coulomb potential, which is a non-negligibly value especially for the large ionic system.\r\nI also tried to train the large system directly. But the I cannot get very good MAE, energy ~ 0.2 eV and 0.05 eV/A no matter how many interaction layer I use  (3 or 6) or how large the cutoff I set (5 A or 8 A) or dataset size (2000 snapshots or

to hear that. Since you also tried fitting the larger system without success and there are ions, my guess would indeed be the electrostatics. There are ways to combine neural network potentials with explicit electrostatics (e.g. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.153101 or https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00181). There are also plans to include them into SchNetPack, but this might take some time. One would e.g. have to figure out how to do the Ewald summation for periodic systems, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat that might be feasible (quickly) though, is increasing the resolution of the radial functions together with increasing the cutoff. SchNet uses Gaussian basis functions for the radial filters, which are set to a default value. If the cutoff is increased without increasing the number of Gaussians, the resolution suffers. Depending on how you use SchNetPack, this can either be controlled via `--num_gaussians` from the command line (default should be 50) or the `n_gaussians` option (default 25) in the `spk.representation.SchNet` class. In theory, SchNet is able to learn interactions of all kind, especially if they have a high magnitude like the electrostatics in ionic systems. Since you already tried increasing the cutoff without improvement, this might indicate that the filter resolution is not high enough.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could try increasing the Gaussians to ~100. Another idea we were playing around with, was to use Cosine basis functions for periodic system, which might be worth a shot and could be implemented quickly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/594728863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3097873454,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwOTc4NzM0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3097873454","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-04T18:26:22Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/594775587","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217#issuecomment-594775587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/217","id":594775587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDc3NTU4Nw==","user":{"login":"simonbatzner","id":24858197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU4MTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24858197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbatzner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbatzner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T19:26:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T19:26:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot for your detailed answer @mgastegger , that was very helpful.
