SchNetPack developers,\r\n\r\nClosely related to this issue, there is another problem if the training has been performed using multiple GPUs and the model is to be used on a CPU. I employ multiple GPUs by using the torch.nn.DataParallel object. This splits the given model into chunks to be parallelizable, while the original model is retained (and also updated!) (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dataparallel). \r\nDuring training, SchNetPack saves the DataParallel object. However, this object cannot be utilized by a CPU device directly, even if the `map_location='cpu'` parameter is specified. The way I circumvented the problem is that I added \r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(model, torch.nn.DataParallel) and map_location == torch.device('cpu'):\r\n        model = model.module\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter `model = torch.load(model_path, map_location=map_location)` in spk_utils.py. \r\nThis extracts the original serial module from the DataParallel object but only if the cpu device is requested. This definitely is an ugly workaround, however, works in my case and does not change the behavior when running in a CUDA environment. Another possibility would be that the trainer always saves the original module instead of the DataParallel model.\r\n\r\nBest, \r\nPhilipp\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/566555617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pschienbein","id":58974737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTc0NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58974737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein","html_url":"https://github.com/pschienbein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschienbein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
