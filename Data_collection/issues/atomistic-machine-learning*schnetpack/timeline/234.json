However, I did notice that the updated version uses more memory compared to the old one. With the old version I was able to run a maximum system size of 2000 atoms on my 8GB GTX 1070 (this is for neighbor list calculation only no NN). But with the new version the maximum system size I can run (before running out of memory) is 1458 atoms (with a 5.0 Ã… cutoff as before).\r\n\r\nAlso there was an update to the old version that fixed some warnings given with PyTorch 1.6\r\n`UserWarning: This overload of nonzero is deprecated:\r\n        nonzero()\r\nConsider using one of the following signatures instead:\r\n        nonzero(*, bool as_tuple) (Triggered internally at  /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1595629395347/work/torch/csrc/utils/python_arg_parser.cpp:766.)\r\n  in_cutoff = (distances < cutoff).nonzero()`\r\n\r\nSo I suggest changing the `in_cutoff = (distances < cutoff).nonzero()` to `in_cutoff = torch.nonzero(distances < cutoff, as_tuple=False)`\r\n\r\n![Torch_update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14222532/94771734-e68e8180-03f2-11eb-979e-d14148affe94.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/701901654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dankomaister","id":14222532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister","html_url":"https://github.com/Dankomaister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dankomaister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3827612054,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgyNzYxMjA1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3827612054","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-01T05:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3827612057,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4Mjc2MTIwNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3827612057","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-01T05:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3841588102,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQzODQxNTg4MTAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3841588102","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commi
