The ase.db tools do also provide the necessary functions in order to get the np-arrays :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/691157157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3756751525,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc1Njc1MTUyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3756751525","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-11T15:18:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3756751531,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc1Njc1MTUzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3756751531","actor":{"login":"giadefa","id":7776826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7776826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa","html_url":"https://github.com/giadefa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-11T15:18:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3756751533,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3NTY3NTE1MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3756751533","actor":{"login":"giadefa","id":7776826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzY4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7776826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa","html_url":"https://github.com/giadefa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giadefa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-11T15:18:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
