Instead of using the full training command, it is also possible to call schnetpack via `spk_run.py from_json <MODELDIR>/args.json`, which will read in the settings from the previous run and restart training.\r\n\r\nUsing only command line options, there is no simple way to start training from a pretrained model yet. A hacky way to still achieve this would be using the above restart mechanism. One could restart training from a copy of the initial model directory, adapting `args.json` to the new data path (`datapath`), model directory (`modelpath`) and training settings (lr, decay, etc). The model architecture should of course be kept the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/677755165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/691065896","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/231#issuecomment-691065896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/231","id":691065896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTA2NTg5Ng==","user":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T12:31:22Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T12:31:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@jwz-ecust
