This neighborlist returns all possible interatomic distances independent of the cutoff radius (explaining the large size of the `_neighbors` and `_cell_offsets` arrays). This automatically results in a larger memory usage. Furthermore, the `SimpleEnvironmentProvider` cannot deal with PBCs if those are relevant for your system.\r\n\r\nYou can try using to the ASE neighborlist (`--environment_provider ase`) which does not suffer from these issues.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would recommend switching to the updated version of schnetpack in the `dev` branch, which has better performance and more features.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/1218335579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7208193105,"node_id":"CE_lADOCMZ5Ls5P2M0BzwAAAAGtpExR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/7208193105","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-17T18:03:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
