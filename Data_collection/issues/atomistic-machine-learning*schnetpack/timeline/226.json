yes, I used the automatic download of the MaterialsProject class so I believe the units are correct and are in terms of eV. @mgastegger thank you for the suggestion, I've changed the `lr` and `patience` to 0.01 and 25 respectively and I'll see how that affects the MAE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/642013157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jstoppelman","id":30512460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTEyNDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30512460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman","html_url":"https://github.com/jstoppelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstoppelman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3429672691,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyOTY3MjY5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3429672691","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-10T13:34:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3429672696,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0Mjk2NzI2OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3429672696","actor":{"login":"Stefaanhess","id":23171261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTcxMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23171261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess","html_url":"https://github.com/Stefaanhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stefaanhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-10T13:34:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3429672705,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyOTY3MjcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/3429672705","actor":{"login":"mgastegger","id":36198330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTk4MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36198330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger","html_url":"https://github.com/mgastegger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgastegger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-10T13:34:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3429672711,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcml

The training that I made the figure from is using a subset of the first 63000 configurations, with 49600 for training and 12400 for validation and I left 1000 points for testing. I did this so the size of my training + validation set was the same as the SchNetPack paper. The total size of the Materials Project database is 124478 crystals currently, I only created a subset of the structures to see if that created any change in the training. Here is the command I used to initialize the database.\r\n```\r\nsub = [i for i in range(63000)]\r\nmp = MaterialsProject(\"../../mp.db\", load_only=[MaterialsProject.EformationPerAtom], subset=sub,
