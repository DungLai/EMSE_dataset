I think it is because the assignment of energies to atoms needs to be learned. So if you have a lot of atoms, this gets even more complicated. It will be better, if you use forces during training, since they contain local information. \r\n\r\nAlso, you could try using vanilla SGD, if ADAM has memory issues. I am to this day not completely sure how much ADAM really helps, especially in the later stages of training...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/523922431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/523929098","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/162#issuecomment-523929098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/162","id":523929098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzkyOTA5OA==","user":{"login":"BioFreak95","id":32635839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjM1ODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32635839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95","html_url":"https://github.com/BioFreak95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-22T14:24:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T14:28:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK I will try both of your tips.
