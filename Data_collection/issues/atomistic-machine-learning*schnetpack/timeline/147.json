The second one is correct, since the waiting time should be increased if the loss did not improve and reset otherwise (but I think it is better to change it to >=). I'll do a pull request.\r\n\r\nTo the questions:\r\n1. You could try that. I found that training with WarmRestarts can lead to overfitting, since your increasing the weights drastically at the large learing rates after the restarts. Maybe the PlateauReduction may help.\r\n2. Yes, that seems reaaly large. Some hints: \r\n- Try smaller cutoffs between 4-5A. That is often sufficient, at least for energy + forces.\r\n- Try 3-6 interaction layers.\r\n- If you did not, use the new TorchEnvironmentProvider:\r\n```\r\ndata = AtomsData(..., environment_provider=TorchEnvironmentProvider(cutoff, device)\r\n```\r\nThe default SimpleEnvironentProvider always calculates the full distance matrix and should only be used for small molecules. Alternatively, you can use the AseEnvironmentProvider, but the new one should be better.\r\n- You can use the DataParallel layer from pytorch to train on multiple GPUs to multiply the batch size.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/518597080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ktschuett","id":6585114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODUxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6585114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett","html_url":"https://github.com/ktschuett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktschuett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/518604094","html_url":"https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/147#issuecomment-518604094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/147","id":518604094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODYwNDA5NA==","user":{"login":"BioFreak95","id":32635839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjM1ODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32635839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95","html_url":"https://github.com/BioFreak95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioFreak95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T10:05:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T10:05:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah.
