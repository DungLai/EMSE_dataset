Hey @JordD04 , I just checked your arguments and the `rho` parameter is set to `{}`. This means, that no weights for the loss function are set and I think this will ignore the forces. This might explain the strange behaviour :)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, Stefaan.\r\nIf force or derivative are defined in the args.json, SchNetPack defines a default value, so forces aren't ignored if the `rho` is blank. \r\nI did go back and review the code surrounding `rho` though and I realised that I misunderstood how `rho` was intended to be defined. In your 2018 and 2019 papers you only ever talk of one `rho` value, so I assumed SchNetPack just wanted a float.\r\nBy setting     \r\n```\r\n\"rho\": {\r\n        \"derivative\": 0.9,\r\n        \"property\": 0.1\r\n    },\r\n```\r\nI was able to get a more sensible plot.\r\n![MLRSS_Filtered_0_9F_rho_forces](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1126249/137327579-89094b4d-e677-415b-a343-8578de3bf011.png)\r\n\r\nMy errors are still large (Formation energy MAE = 0.131 eV / atom and Forces MAE = 0.220 eV/ Å / atom), but perhaps I just need to scale up my hyperparameters. I'm using `cutoff = 5`, `features = 128`, `interactions = 3`, and `num_gaussians = 50`. I'm not sure if that's considered a lot for a periodic system with forces, but I see that you used 6 interactions when training on just energies on MP structures.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/comments/943366901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JordD04","id":1126249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1126249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04","html_url":"https://github.com/JordD04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5463912132,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCMZ5Ls48uM5BzwAAAAFFrK7E","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5463912132","actor":{"login":"JordD04","id":1126249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1126249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04","html_url":"https://github.com/JordD04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-14T13:37:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5463912135,"node_id":"SE_lADOCMZ5Ls48uM5BzwAAAAFFrK7H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack/issues/events/5463912135","actor":{"login":"JordD04","id":1126249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1126249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04","html_url":"https://github.com/JordD04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordD04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-14T13:37:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
