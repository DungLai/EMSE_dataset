What your doing is sqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2] rather than \r\nsqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2]\r\nWhen you are doing length = len(testInstance) - 1, then since your testInstance length =3, that means you are considering a length of 2 --> so it will be : for I in range (2), and you'll ignore the r channel in that case. Are you intending to do that? As what I know, you should also consider the r channel. \r\nThanks\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ahmetozlu","id":22610163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjEwMTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22610163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmetozlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmetozlu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetozlu/color_recognition/issues/2/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ahmetozlu/color_recognition/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
