It's an awesome tool! \r\n\r\nRecently I've been trying to retrain it to be able to remove the alterations I get with a reflector telescope. I've been trying to get others interested enough to give me some sample images so that I can do a nice long training run... \r\n\r\nDo you have any advice on the types of image that will improve the training? I first trained it for 70 epochs with 5 whole images that I prepared, but the output images weren't getting any better at removing the diffractions spikes, which I figured was because it was seeing them too infrequently on the whole images. After that, I tried using smaller images where I had just had clipped out the stars with spikes, but the output I'm getting now is very blocky...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4738389/86532146-7e95d100-bebf-11ea-9edb-1ede3b8f9f53.png)\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any advice on the type and number I'd need for a good training set! I'm just starting again now from fresh wit the 5 original images... on Epoch 50...","closed_by":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
