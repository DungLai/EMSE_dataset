We find this project very interesting and of potential usage for our big ongoing full-sky survey. We would like to experiment with improving `starnet` performance a little (because unfortunately it is not always produce adoptable results) and probably tune it for FITS we will use.

Specifically:\r\n\r\n* Can you share the data used and if yes, on which terms?\r\n* How big the data size for training you use?\r\n* How do you remove stars from images in training data to train the whole net? \r\n\r\nIn any case we will surely acknowledge and referencing your work","closed_by":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
