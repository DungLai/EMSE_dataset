I wish the weights were stored in this GitHub repository (maybe on master branch, maybe on separate branch) for easier updating. If you would update the weights, users would have to download and update them manually, but if they were stored in this repository, updating them locally would be as easy as typing `git pull`! :smile: \r\n\r\nYou'd have to use https://git-lfs.github.com/ because there's a 100MB/file limit on regular repos","closed_by":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/1/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
