I saw a picture on instagram of someone using your code to remove stars and the effect was amazing.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to test if myself, I run into a save error:\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is linked to that line: https://github.com/nekitmm/starnet/blob/master/transform.py#L122\r\n\r\nProbably removing the \"./\" would be a good idea as i was trying to run your script with an absolute path and not a relative path and it couldn't save due to a weird path :)\r\n\r\nPS: also didn't managed to have the plugin installed with pixinsight 1.8, including with recursive search - even though the files were there. Maybe something changed with the versions ? It's not related to your warning on AVX since i could run the script successfully.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, great job and interesting project !\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
