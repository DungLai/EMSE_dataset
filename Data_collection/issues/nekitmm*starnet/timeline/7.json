Thanks for all the kind words!\r\n\r\nI can't see it - what is the error you ran into? It shows just a blank grey rectangle...\r\n\r\nAbout PI - what exact version do you have - 1.8.8-5? If yes, then it won't work on Mac, some issue with digital signatures, you can find more info on PI forums. Your options for now are either get back to 1.8.8-4 or wait for 1.8.8-6 which should resolve the issue (probably).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/comments/648590630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3546759097,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU0Njc1OTA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nekitmm/starnet/issues/events/3546759097","actor":{"login":"nekitmm","id":17030346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm","html_url":"https://github.com/nekitmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekitmm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-15T03:59:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
