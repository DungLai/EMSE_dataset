So you're saying that the Decoder is operating on a black background, then for the color mixing it is converted to white background. Why is it multiplied with the canvas in `canvas = canvas * (1 - stroke[:, i]) + color_stroke[:, i]` with black background again? After all `color_stroke` already includes it anyways `color_stroke = stroke * x[:, -3:].view(-1, 1, 1, 3)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/comments/527200420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kampelmuehler","id":9306799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDY3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9306799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler","html_url":"https://github.com/kampelmuehler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kampelmuehler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/comments/527203642","html_url":"https://github.com/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/21#issuecomment-527203642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/21","id":527203642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzIwMzY0Mg==","user":{"login":"hzwer","id":10103856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer","html_url":"https://github.com/hzwer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-02T16:49:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T16:49:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Adding strokes does not directly cover an area.
