In our task, we first select a target image for CelebA dataset(I think your said number of image is the size of dataset?), and each step the actor decide to draw 5 strokes on the canvas, and the env feedback the state. The number of step control the total step number of drawing this target image. We do not count the number of episode and we just care the number of training iterations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/comments/739886334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hzwer","id":10103856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer","html_url":"https://github.com/hzwer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/comments/744612012","html_url":"https://github.com/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/42#issuecomment-744612012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/42","id":744612012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDYxMjAxMg==","user":{"login":"NiharikaVadlamudi","id":58340986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQwOTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58340986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi","html_url":"https://github.com/NiharikaVadlamudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T18:03:22Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T18:03:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yep !
