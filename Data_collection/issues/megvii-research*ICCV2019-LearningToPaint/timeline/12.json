\r\nIn addition, the normal function in \r\nhttps://github.com/hzwer/LearningToPaint/blob/master/baseline_modelfree/Renderer/stroke_gen.py \r\n```python\r\ndef normal(x, width):\r\n    return (int)(x * (width - 1) + 0.5)\r\n\r\ndef draw(f, width=128):\r\n    x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, z0, z2, w0, w2 = f\r\n    x1 = x0 + (x2 - x0) * x1\r\n    y1 = y0 + (y2 - y0) * y1\r\n    x0 = normal(x0, width * 2)\r\n    x1 = normal(x1, width * 2)\r\n    x2 = normal(x2, width * 2)\r\n    y0 = normal(y0, width * 2)\r\n    y1 = normal(y1, width * 2)\r\n    y2 = normal(y2, width * 2)\r\n    z0 = (int)(1 + z0 * width // 2)\r\n    z2 = (int)(1 + z2 * width // 2)\r\n    canvas = np.zeros([width * 2, width * 2]).astype('float32')\r\n    tmp = 1. / 100\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        t = i * tmp\r\n        x = (int)((1-t) * (1-t) * x0 + 2 * t * (1-t) * x1 + t * t * x2)\r\n        y = (int)((1-t) * (1-t) * y0 + 2 * t * (1-t) * y1 + t * t * y2)\r\n        z = (int)((1-t) * z0 + t * z2)\r\n        w = (1-t) * w0 + t * w2\r\n        cv2.circle(canvas, (y, x), z, w, -1)\r\n    return 1 - cv2.resize(canvas, dsize=(width, width))\r\n\r\n```\r\ndoes not seem to be like normalization in the range (0~1), what is its purpose by the way?\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention and hope that you can help to clarify those points.
