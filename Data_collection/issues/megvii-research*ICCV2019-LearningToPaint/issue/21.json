It is trained by comparing to the ground truth, why should it learn the inverse, instead of the actual image?\r\n\r\nWhy is the stroke then \r\nhttps://github.com/hzwer/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/blob/5f62ffcb605654716efaf95cb4508c087bc01522/baseline/DRL/ddpg.py#L28 ?\r\n\r\nAnd why is it added to the canvas via https://github.com/hzwer/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/blob/5f62ffcb605654716efaf95cb4508c087bc01522/baseline/DRL/ddpg.py#L36 ?\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you would do the `1 - stroke` at every step in this chain. Also the canvas is initialized to all zeros. Is the `canvas * (1 - stroke[:, k])` in `canvas = canvas * (1 - stroke[:, k]) + color_stroke[:, k]` really necessary? `stroke` is included in `color_stroke` anyway.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?
