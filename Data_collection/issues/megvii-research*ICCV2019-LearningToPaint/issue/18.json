I wonder how these two changes could impact the performance:\r\n\r\n## 1. Replacing WGAN-GP with spectral normalization\r\nSpectral normalization has two main advantages: \r\n\r\n1. Slight performance improvement relative to WGAN-GP on ResNet. The inception score of spectral normalization had a slight upper hand — approximately 0.16 — with less deviation compared to WGAN-GP.\r\n\r\n2. Spectral normalization is ~30% more computationally efficient. \r\nSince both actors and critics use ResNet as the backbone, replacing WGAN-GP with spectral normalization can potentially yield meaningful results.\r\n\r\n## 2. Combining WGAN-GP with spectral normalization\r\nThe authors of the spectral normalization paper suggest that combining WGAN-GP with spectral normalization can further improve the results compared to the baseline WGA-GP and spectral normalization GAN.
