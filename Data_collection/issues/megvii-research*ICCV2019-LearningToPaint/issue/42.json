But here, we are *randomly* generating batchSize of 64, in both train and valid (after every 1000th iteration afair)  parts and perform training for 5,00,000 epochs. I find this confusing, the randomly generated samples could vary drastically across the epochs, how are you ensuring model improvement?  Are you simply trying to overfit the model to all possible combinations of co-ordinates in the canvas? I want to understand why you have taken this approach.\r\n\r\nThanks \r\nNiharika","closed_by":{"login":"NiharikaVadlamudi","id":58340986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQwOTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58340986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi","html_url":"https://github.com/NiharikaVadlamudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiharikaVadlamudi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
