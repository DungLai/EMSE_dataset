I'm surprised that neural networks can do such incredible thing.\r\nThere is a small problem about Q value. In the paper cur_q = reward + Î³ * target_q, so normally it should be \"return Q, gan_reward\" in evaluate(). This is actually the case in model-free method. But in model-based method it's \"return (Q+gan_reward), gan_reward\", this makes me confused. Why does the Q value need to be added with the reward of the same step?","closed_by":{"login":"hzwer","id":10103856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer","html_url":"https://github.com/hzwer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzwer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/megvii-research/ICCV2019-LearningToPaint/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
