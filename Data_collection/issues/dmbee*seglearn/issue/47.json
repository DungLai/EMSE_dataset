Specifically I just add up the `FeatureRep()` into the pipe definition  as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\npipe = Pype([('seg', Segment(width=100, overlap=0.5, order='C')),\r\n             ('features', FeatureRep()),\r\n             ('crnn', KerasClassifier(build_fn=crnn_model, epochs=1, batch_size=256, verbose=0))])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then I encountered an error as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential_14 is incompatible with the layer: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2. Full shape received: [None, 66]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd imagine that I need to modify the `input_shape` definition of the `crnn_model` but am not quite sure how to do that. Appreciate any pointers for it, thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
