I have a DataFrame of shape (1017, 15). The last column is the target so I created two dfs, one for X (1017, 14) and one for y (1017). I tried to pass those values to  `temporal_split` but I always get an error no matter what I do (passing the df, passing them as lists). For example, passing them as list gives:\r\n\r\n> KeyError: \"None of [Int64Index([   0,    1,    2,    3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9,\\n            ...\\n             991,  992,  993,  994,  995,  996,  997,  998,  999, 1000],\\n           dtype='int64', length=1001)] are in the [columns]\"\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, I pass them as df I get:\r\n\r\n> AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'ts_data'\r\n\r\nThe same holds true if I manually split the DataFrames and pass them to `seg.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)`\r\nI tried to put the _date_ column in the df as well as in the index but the error is still there.\r\nWhat's wrong?\r\n\r\nInfo of the Dataframe:\r\n```\r\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\r\nInt64Index: 1017 entries, 896 to 1912\r\nData columns (total 13 columns):\r\n #   Column        Non-Null Count  Dtype         \r\n---  ------        --------------  -----         \r\n 0   date          1017 non-null   datetime64[ns]\r\n 1   id            1017 non-null   object        \r\n 2   price         1017 non-null   float64       \r\n 3   month         1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 4   year          1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 5   event_name_1  1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 6   event_type_1  1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 7   event_name_2  1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 8   event_type_2  1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 9   snap_CA       1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 10  dow           1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 11  is_weekend    1017 non-null   int64         \r\n 12  is_holiday    1017 non-null   int64         \r\ndtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(1), int64(10), object(1)\r\nmemory usage: 111.2+ KB\r\n```\r\nI tried to use it with _date_ column or _date_ index or as a list.
