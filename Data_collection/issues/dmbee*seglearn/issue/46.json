For example, lets say I have a list of events that are interesting based on a time series, and would like a window of the previous X observations per event.  I would like to use the index to find the location in the time series, get the last X observations.  Then iterate over the rest of the indexes to get all windows.\r\n\r\nHere is the code I am using to segment my data into (samples, length, dimensions) using the index:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      self.Xs = []\r\n        for i in self.Xtbl.index:\r\n            start = self.X.index.get_loc(i)-sliding_window\r\n            end = self.X.index.get_loc(i)\r\n            window = self.X.iloc[start:end, ].to_numpy()\r\n            self.Xs.append(window)\r\n        self.Xs = np.stack(self.Xs)\r\n        self.ys = self.ytbl.copy()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to use seglearn with this functionality in an pipeline to fit.  However, the segment class doesn't appear to segment based on events.  Thanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
