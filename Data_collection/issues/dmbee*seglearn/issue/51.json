Or, perhaps does this mean that **y**_i is the target vector for the corresponding samples < **x**_i,1, ... **x**_i,t > meaning that **y**_i corresponds to the **X**_i sample but is not _composed_ of them. I think the phrasing and use of the word \"with\" makes it a little confusing if this is the case.
