And I would thus like to avoid the `PadTrunc()` step.\r\n```\r\nPype([('pad', PadTrunc(width=1000)),\r\n      ('features', FeatureRep('default')),\r\n          ...\r\n```\r\nIn theory I see no problem with calculatuing the features from samples of different lengths, but I cant manage to do it practically.\r\n\r\n`PadTrunc()` reshapes the data to `(n_samples, truncation_width, n_channels)` , which seems to be the assumed shape for the rest of the pipeline. Without `PadTrunc()` there is no way to get samples of different lengths in to an array of this type. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to do this in seglearn somehow, and if not, what is the consensus with `PadTrunc()` in order to avoid affecting the features?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/44/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
