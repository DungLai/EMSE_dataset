In the docs, the _sliding window method_ is mentioned, but I'm not able to find any more information on my own.\r\nI'd be very thankful if someone could help me out :)\r\n\r\nIf it is easier to discuss a specific case, this is what I'm doing at the moment:\r\n\r\n**Data:**\r\nn_samples = 6000\r\nn_dimensions = 128\r\nVarious time lengths for each sample (300 -700)\r\n\r\n**Labels:**\r\n0 / 1\r\n\r\n**Classifier:**\r\n```\r\nPype([('segment', PadTrunc(width=700)),\r\n      ('features', FeatureRep()),\r\n      ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\r\n      ('svc', svm.LinearSVC(class_weight='balanced', max_iter=2000))])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, I get 11 features per dimension with `FeatureRep()`,  which would result in a 11x128 matrix per sample, which wont match the standard svm input.\r\nIn other words, how are the 128D-timeseries condensed into something that can be fed into the svm?\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
