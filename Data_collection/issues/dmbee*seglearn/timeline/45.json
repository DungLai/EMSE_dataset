Actually I have several thousands series to analyse (all with the same characteristics that I can easily melt in a single df even though they are mostly independent; and since they are independent and all different ARIMA would require to calculate p and q for each one and that would take to much time; moreover since they have seasonality the  model would be a SARIMA, with even more calculations) but before training on the whole dataset I wanted to test it with just one series. I reduced the segment size and now I don't get any more errors but the prediction quality, at least for this one, is not exciting. I will test it on a bunch of series but, in case, what may I do to improve?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/634739647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adalseno","id":2405291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno","html_url":"https://github.com/adalseno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adalseno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/634744931","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee/seglearn/issues/45#issuecomment-634744931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/45","id":634744931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDc0NDkzMQ==","user":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-27T15:34:12Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T15:34:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I wouldn't expect good results with one series. Using sliding window segmentation doesn't always make sense for every problem. It's great for some things like earthquakes, activity recognition, where there is no or little time dependency outside the window. Generally, you need to make sure the window length is long enough to incorporate enough dynamics sensible for a prediction. It's important to interpolate the samples (if not regularly sampled) to a fixed sampling rate so the window time is constant. Setting high overlap is a good data augmentation strategy. Concatenating any heuristics available to the calculated features eg season is also very helpful. \r\n\r\nJust a few thoughts. Good luck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/634744931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3378760028,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM3ODc2MDAyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/events/3378760028","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-27T15:34:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
