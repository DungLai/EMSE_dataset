The purpose of the FeatureRep transform is to vectorize the data. The code for this is in FeatureRep.transform\r\n\r\n```python\r\nts = np.column_stack([self.features[f](Xt) for f in self.features])\r\nif Xc is not None:\r\n  fts = np.column_stack([fts, Xc])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Segment transforms get the data as a 3D tensor [samples x window time x channels]. Then FeatureRep vectorizes it to [samples x features] which is suitable for estimators like SCV. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion: You might have better performance if you use feature selection in your pipeline. Between scaler and svc. Because you have so many channels / features.\r\n\r\nsklearn has feature selection transformers you can put right into the seglearn pipeline: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/602690525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3155880984,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE1NTg4MDk4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/events/3155880984","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-23T15:55:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
