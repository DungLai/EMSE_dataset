For instance if you segment a time series with 10 samples, using a width of 3 and no overlap, you will get 3 separate segments and 3 target values (assuming y is also a time series). Many ML algorithms require fixed length time series for classification/regression, and with this package you can use sliding window segmentation or padding/truncation to achieve that in your time series pipeline.
