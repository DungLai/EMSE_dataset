From what I understand, `Pype.predict_segmented_series` is used to predict every sampling point of the input data. Quite interesting the prediction vs time graph from `plot_feature_rep.py` that you plotted. Back to the original point, do you have any methods or suggestions to convert this graph (predictions of every sampling point of data) back to the true label, `[2 6 5]` ?.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/607578729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ninfueng","id":28499769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDk5NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28499769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng","html_url":"https://github.com/ninfueng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ninfueng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/607586645","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee/seglearn/issues/39#issuecomment-607586645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/39","id":607586645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzU4NjY0NQ==","user":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-02T02:30:36Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T02:30:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I am not sure what you are asking exactly?
