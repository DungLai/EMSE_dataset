Then use y_func = 'last' and step=1 for the Segment transform. Another alternative (more common) would be to define y as the number of timesteps prior to an event. Again you could use the same segmentation strategy. You have to decide what makes sense for your problem. Are you trying to predict time to an event? Or presence or absence of an event in the window.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to do something more complicated, you'd can write your own transform. Just inherit XyTransformerMixin, and implement fit and transform functions and you can include your own transformer in the pipeline. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/637708662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3398815530,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM5ODgxNTUzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/events/3398815530","actor":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-02T17:53:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
