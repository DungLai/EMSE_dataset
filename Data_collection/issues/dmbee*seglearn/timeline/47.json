My intention was to have a set of multi-channel raw EMG signals, extract features (`FeatureRep()`) say `root_mean_square` and use such feature for the CRNN input instead of the raw signal. In this case how could I amend the CRNN input or pype parameters?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/678813454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fairread","id":5622023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjIwMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5622023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread","html_url":"https://github.com/fairread","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fairread/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/comments/678835209","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee/seglearn/issues/47#issuecomment-678835209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmbee/seglearn/issues/47","id":678835209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODgzNTIwOQ==","user":{"login":"dmbee","id":36900102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTAwMTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36900102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee","html_url":"https://github.com/dmbee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmbee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-23T22:52:59Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T22:52:59Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The main advantage of a a neural network is it can learn arbitrary feature representations - so I would encourage you not to use that approach. \r\n\r\nIn any case, seglearn is not really setup for what you want since the FeatureRep collapses the time dimension in the segment. You would need to then reconstitute the feature vectors into time series and then segment the time series of features. You can look at Pype.predict_series to see how you can get predictions as a time series and maybe that will provide some inspiration. You will need to implement this capability yourself if you wish to try it.
