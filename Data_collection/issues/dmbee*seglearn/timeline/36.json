You would have to create a new transformer class to do this. Rolling averages have some significant limitations though. Hard to know best approach without knowing your application and the timescale of the dynamics. For activity recognition, you just need to make the window length long enough to observe the activity. \r\n\r\nFor problems where long term dynamics inform current prediction, different approach is needed.
