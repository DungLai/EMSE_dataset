But I am not sure about an implementation detail of the paper's equation 5:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17143022/40471636-d55f95fa-5f69-11e8-8015-80c9775759de.png)\r\nwhere vector `q^{h}_{u,i}` is transformed by a matrix `W^{h}` before adding with other vectors (`o^{h}_{u,i}` and `b^{h}`). My problem is that the size of `q^{h}_{u,i}` is different given different i. Then how is it possible to determine the size of `W^{h}`? \r\n\r\nAs the code is not available yet, I open this issue here. Thank you very much in advance for checking my problem. Please let me know if I misunderstood the paper.","closed_by":{"login":"SunYatong","id":17143022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQzMDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17143022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong","html_url":"https://github.com/SunYatong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SunYatong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tebesu/CollaborativeMemoryNetwork/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tebesu/CollaborativeMemoryNetwork/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
