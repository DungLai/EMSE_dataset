Even though, all works fine including the model training but in the plot the training and validation curves are not shown. However, when I refresh the jupyter notebook and run it from beginning the full graphs are displayed. But when I want to do model tuning the curves do not display. May be `.ipynb` file is large. I do not know.\r\n\r\nWould anyone be able to help me on this regard. \r\nThe modules that were used for the visualisation are below:\r\n```python\r\nfrom IPython.display import SVG\r\nimport livelossplot\r\nplot_losses = livelossplot.PlotLossesKeras()\r\n```\r\nAlso please find the image of the training graph without the training and validation curves below:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2019-05-14_14-00-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31654102/57669988-a50c0380-7650-11e9-8851-8115f8dcd637.png)\r\n\r\nYour input in this issue is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMichael","closed_by":{"login":"MichaelSchroter","id":31654102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjU0MTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31654102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelSchroter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelSchroter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
