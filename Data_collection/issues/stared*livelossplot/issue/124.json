This means that as I train more, the graphs are getting \"scrunched\" in width.  Would it be possible to add the ability to define the width of the graphs in epochs?  For example, if I define 100 then the graph will grow to show 0-99 but as I pass that the graph will show 1-100 and then 2-101, and 3-102.  Basically a sliding/scrolling graph showing my last 100 epochs?","closed_by":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/124/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
