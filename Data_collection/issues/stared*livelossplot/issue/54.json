I would like to have two small features, take a look here : \r\n\r\nMean squared error (cost function):\r\ntraining   (min:    0.000, max:    0.000, cur:    0.000)\r\nvalidation (min:    0.000, max:    0.000, cur:    0.000)\r\n\r\nAccuracy:\r\ntraining   (min:    0.549, max:    0.549, cur:    0.549)\r\nvalidation (min:    0.355, max:    0.355, cur:    0.355)\r\n\r\nthis won't be enough for many purposes on precision, why? first 10 epochs of my neural starts right off of 0.00001 epoch loss !!!! the top table is pretty much useless with that precision.\r\n\r\nAlso, a nice thing to have before the tables would be a line that shows the finishing time on last epoch (how much time the last epoch took in total) side by side with the last epoch's number (when you run 3000 epochs, reading what epoch you are in from the chart is a headache)! I would appreciate if you add these two features. for the precision, maybe you can accept an integer into the function that would let us define how many digits in decimal place we need?","closed_by":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
