I would like to suggest to add an option to skip `plt.show()` in `draw_plots()` so that the plots can later be modified. That is something like\r\n\r\n- `show=True`: (default) run `plt.show()` as usual\r\n- `show=False`: skip `plt.show()`\r\n\r\nBy skipping `plt.show()`, users can then, for example, change the styles, modify the labels or add annotations, and call `plt.show()` afterward. For instance,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nliveloss.draw(show=False)\r\nplt.xlabel('step')\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/73/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
