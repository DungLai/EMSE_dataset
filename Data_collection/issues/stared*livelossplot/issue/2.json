(anytime I call `liveloss.draw()`)\r\n\r\nDo you have a way of keeping that output ?\r\nIt seems that this mechanism is at the core of your package:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# livelossplot/core.py:15\r\ndef draw_plot(logs, metrics, figsize=None, max_epoch=None,\r\n              max_cols=2,\r\n              validation_fmt=\"val_{}\",\r\n              metric2title={}):\r\n    clear_output(wait=True) # I see what you did here\r\n    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I suspect that finding a workaround will be pretty difficult.
