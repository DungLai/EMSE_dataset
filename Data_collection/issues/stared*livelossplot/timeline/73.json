noticed that any output besides the loss graph of livelossplot gets cleared at each training iteration. (anytime I call `liveloss.draw()`)\r\n\r\nDo you have a way of keeping that output ?\r\nIt seems that this mechanism is at the core of your package:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# livelossplot/core.py:15\r\ndef draw_plot(logs, metrics, figsize=None, max_epoch=None,\r\n              max_cols=2,\r\n              validation_fmt=\"val_{}\",\r\n              metric2title={}):\r\n    clear_output(wait=True) # I see what you did here\r\n    plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I suspect that finding a workaround will be pretty difficult. With that said, I still would like to know if anyone has suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/2/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Bartolo1024","id":24765461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzY1NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24765461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024","html_url":"https://github.com/Bartolo1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T11:57:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T11:57:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/stared/livelossplot/pull/122","id":663705509,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU1MDcxOTQx","number":122,"title":"Move
