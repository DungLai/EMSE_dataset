It contains three functions: `after_subplot`, `before_plots`, `after_plots` - that can be override in the plugin constructor. In that case, you should use `after_subplot`.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom livelossplot import PlotLosses\r\nfrom livelossplot.outputs import MatplotlibPlot\r\n\r\n\r\ndef custom_after_subplot(self, ax: plt.Axes, group_name: str, x_label: str):\r\n    ax.set_title(group_name)\r\n    ax.set_xlabel(x_label)\r\n    ax.legend(loc='lower right')\r\n\r\n\r\noutputs = [MatplotlibPlot(after_subplot=custom_after_subplot)]\r\ngroups = {'acccuracy': ['acc', 'val_acc'], 'log-loss': ['loss', 'val_loss']}\r\nplotlosses = PlotLosses(groups=groups, outputs=outputs)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/comments/669731031/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Bartolo1024","id":24765461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzY1NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24765461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024","html_url":"https://github.com/Bartolo1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartolo1024/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3638382378,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYzODM4MjM3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/events/3638382378","actor":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-10T11:42:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
