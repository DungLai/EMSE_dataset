intends to solve #124 - as very often the first epochs have very large (and largely not meaningful) values.

For zero we don't use the option at all.\r\n\r\n#125 has an approach for `MatplotlibPlot` only. I wanted to do it differently - by creating an option for `MainLogger`, so that it will propagate to all other elements as well (e.g. `ExtremaPrinter`).\r\n\r\n* [X] add to `MainLogger`\r\n* [X] make it work with `MatplotlibPlot` (sort of works)\r\n* [x] make it work without pesky warnings :)\r\n* [x] make it work with `ExtremaPrinter` (we want, and need, to remove value caching)\r\n* [x] make it work in general\r\n* [x] write tests\r\n\r\nRight now it \"sort of works\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"656\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-11-30 at 18 58 55\"
