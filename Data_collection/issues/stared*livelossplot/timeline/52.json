I just figured out what the issue is and it is related to training time but more to the use of the `livelossplot` library.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, after each epoch a plot of the accuracies and losses on (validation and training sets) are displayed. But the issue is that after each epoch, the plot is displayed and I have to manually close it so that the training process continues. Then at the end  of the next epoch the updated plots are displayed and I have to do it all over again.\r\n\r\nNote that I am running my code using a batch file (that uses the command line), not in spyder or something similar.
