Write\r\n`model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='mae', metrics=['mae'])` and it will be all right (and actually in your case `metrics` is not needed as we keep tract of `'mae'` anyway). \r\n\r\nFor typical networks there is only one loss function, see https://keras.io/models/model/#compile.\r\nI need to dive into `model.compile` to make sure I pre-process data in the same way.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/comments/374603133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1530941245,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUzMDk0MTI0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/events/1530941245","actor":{"login":"utausheva","id":22944267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTQ0MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22944267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva","html_url":"https://github.com/utausheva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-20T13:46:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1530941248,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1MzA5NDEyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/events/1530941248","actor":{"login":"utausheva","id":22944267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTQ0MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22944267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva","html_url":"https://github.com/utausheva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utausheva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-20T13:46:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1530941256,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxNTMwOTQxMjU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/events/1530941256","actor":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-20T13:46:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1530977795,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUzMDk3Nzc5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/events/1530977795","actor":{"login":"fculinovic","id":9268051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjgwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatar

there,\r\n\r\nJust sending in a quick fix of a TypeError I encountered, somewhat related to stared/livelossplot#3. Problematic lines are at [here](https://github.com/stared/livelossplot/blob/128931c095d3d882d8e31c3a14f12c49fb870f72/livelossplot/keras_plot.py#L48-L54).\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n~/.local/share/virtualenvs/.../lib/python3.6/site-packages/livelossplot/keras_plot.py in on_train_begin(self, logs)\r\n     52             losses = [self.model.loss]\r\n     53 \r\n---> 54         loss_name = loss2name(losses[0])\r\n     55         self.metric2printable['loss'] = \"{} (cost function)\".format(self.metric2printable.get(loss_name, loss_name))\r\n     56         if len(losses) > 1:\r\n\r\nTypeError: 'dict_values' object does not support indexing\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a [Python 2 to 3 problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16228248/how-can-i-get-list-of-values-from-dict/16228268#16228268). Calling dict.values() in Python3 returns a 'dict_values' object (which cannot be indexed) instead of a list, so the solution is to explicitly set it as a list using `losses = list(self.model.loss.values())` in the early part of the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
