If we modify the file `livelossplot/core.py` on line 30 to specify a figure name (for example, it could be \"livelossplot\"!), add a `plt.clf()` right after line 30, and add the keyword `block=False` in the call to `plt.show()` on line 71, it would be possible to use Livelossplot from IPython or from a Python script!\r\n\r\nI have been using these modifications locally with the Qt5Agg backend for a while and it works well. The call to `plt.clf()` is somewhat slow, but if an epoch lasts more than a full second, it's not noticeable.\r\n\r\nI would gladly make a pull-request if you're interested, I think these small modifications would solve a large part of non-Notebook support!\r\n\r\n**Edit**: I forgot an additional line. Right after `plt.show(block=False)`, we need to add `plt.pause(0.001)`. This tells Matplotlib to wait for 0.001 second and execute the windows events, otherwise the created window will be unresponsive until the loop is finished!\r\n\r\nI tried the following code in a Jupyter notebook, in IPython, and in a script file called with `python script.py` and they all worked. It was slower in a script file, and the windows dissapears as soon as the script is over. To prevent this, you can add a `plt.show()` right at the end.\r\n```\r\nimport random\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\r\nfrom matplotlib import get_backend\r\n\r\nprint(get_backend())\r\n\r\ndata = []\r\nfor i in range(25):\r\n    data.append(random.random())\r\n    clear_output(wait=True)\r\n    plt.figure(\"livelossplot\", figsize=None)\r\n    plt.clf()\r\n    plt.plot(data)\r\n    plt.show(block=False)\r\n    plt.pause(0.001)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/comments/571308112/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PhilMacKay","id":1019715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilMacKay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilMacKay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/comments/601837611","html_url":"https://github.com/stared/livelossplot/issues/76#issuecomment-601837611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stared/livelossplot/issues/76","id":601837611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTgzNzYxMQ==","user":{"login":"stared","id":1001610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared","html_url":"https://github.com/stared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-20T18:00:45Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T18:00:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks for your comment, @PhilMacKay. I had some time off with livelossplot. But in the last two weeks, we rewrote the library (with @Bartolo1024) and released as 0.5.0. Now it is more modular and it will be easier to make such changes.\r\n\r\nAs you see, we started targetting non-Jupyter environments, see  https://github.com/stared/livelossplot/blob/master/livelossplot/outputs/. We will try to include it in 0.5.1 release, most likely using (for livelossplot) parameters to specify if it is `'jupyter'`, `'script'` or `'server'` (only saving plots as files).
