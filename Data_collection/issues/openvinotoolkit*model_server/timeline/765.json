It does works after change to 10.\r\n\r\nYes that change works but only if you sent images that detect exactly 10 faces. If you will be sending images that will have varied number of detections you need to set `demultiply_count=0`\r\n\r\n\r\n> After completion of face_detection node and the custom node we are resizing the face_Image to the shape of **[10 , 1 , 64 , 64 , 3]** and this shape is the input for the next two models age and emotion recognition.\r\n> \r\n> How does it splits the requests to the next two models.? Because both models are using same inputs as [10 , 1 ,64 , 64 , 3]. I am a very confused at this stage.\r\n> \r\n> It does splits 5 requests to each model or it splits 10 to each model.?\r\n\r\nCustom node prepares the output in the shape `[detectionCount, 1, 64, 64, 3]`. Then when pipeline receives such output demultiplexer divides it into 10 requests for following nodes with shape [1, 64, 64, 3]. Each of following nodes receives each cropped face image.\r\n\r\nThen at the gathering node (exit node if not specified) it will gather the results from the previous demultiplication.
