Imagine you have a model with really weird inputs or outputs names (or both) for example:\r\ninputs: **1039_g4d** \r\noutputs: **vk19313_iljk** and **999_0_123k**\r\n(I just put some random strings here, not a real model names 😄 )\r\nYou can use mapping config to make it more human readable, by putting mapping_config.json alongside with model _xml_ and _bin_ files with following content in it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n       \"inputs\":  { \r\n            \"1039_g4d\":\"input\"\r\n       },\r\n       \"outputs\":{\r\n            \"vk19313_iljk\":\"output1\",\r\n            \"999_0_123k\":\"output2\"\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOVMS will map your custom inputs and outputs names to the real model inputs and outputs, so in you client script you could use **input**, **output1**, **output2** instead of **1039_g4d**, **vk19313_iljk** and **999_0_123k**\r\n\r\n\r\n>>_\"Can I run a common script for all the models with different input and output names?\"_\r\n\r\nWell, you can for sure parameterize  your script to take input and outputs names from command line or a file for example, but you will also need to fill the inputs with something. You also need to interpret the results that can mean something totally different depending on the model you use. So at some point you will probably want to have different logic for different models. But if you have a specific use case in mind and are going to use pretty similar models then you can parameterize quite a lot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/685449017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/685452111","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/300#issuecomment-685452111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/300","id":685452111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTQ1MjExMQ==","user":{"login":"mihir135","id":40884708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODg0NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40884708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135","html_url":"https://github.com/mihir135","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihir135/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T08:46:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T08:47:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"_Sure,
