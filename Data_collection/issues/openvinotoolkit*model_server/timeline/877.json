Schedule async inference on N data chunk\r\n    2. Read results for N-1 data chunk\r\n```\r\nOVMS does not have a context of many data chunks in one thread, it receives requests one by one on each server thread.\r\nInternally OVMS uses async inference, but it's not exposed to the user as there's only one way model server can process incoming requests.
