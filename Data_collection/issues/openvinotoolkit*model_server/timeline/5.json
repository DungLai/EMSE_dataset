Dockerfile_binary_openvino.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/439064310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dtrawins","id":20400806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAwODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20400806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins","html_url":"https://github.com/dtrawins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/439269238","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/5#issuecomment-439269238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/5","id":439269238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTI2OTIzOA==","user":{"login":"qindj","id":1707762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDc3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1707762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj","html_url":"https://github.com/qindj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qindj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-16T03:19:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T03:19:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks
