good reading about mounting volumes in docker containers is in https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/\r\n`-v` option is mapping the filesystem path from the host to the filesystem in the docker container. After the docker image name, there are ovms parameters used inside the container. It means those parameters refer to the filesystem inside the container. While you create the configuration file for ovms, you need to pass it to the container via `-v` command. In the command above the phrase  `<config.json>` must be replace with the actual file path to the configuration file on the host. In the container it will be mapped to `/opt/ml/config.json` path.
