\r\nThanks for the fast response.\r\n\r\nI'm using gRPC for my calls. The output shape returned by the GetModelMetadata function is [1L, 1L, 200L, 7L] as expected and when I send input data with a shape (4, 3, 300, 300) the response has a shape (4, 1, 200, 7).

I just tested this and I get the same response. The first response in the batch is correct and the other 3 follow the format [id, label, conf, 0, 0, 0, 0].\r\n\r\nIs this reproducible for you or does this model work as expected when you use

now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/533736320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dtrawins","id":20400806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAwODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20400806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins","html_url":"https://github.com/dtrawins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2651717417,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY1MTcxNzQxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/2651717417","actor":{"login":"Steedance","id":45638338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM4MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45638338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance","html_url":"https://github.com/Steedance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-20T22:55:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2651717418,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NTE3MTc0MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/2651717418","actor":{"login":"Steedance","id":45638338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM4MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45638338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance","html_url":"https://github.com/Steedance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steedance/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-20T22:55:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/535535252","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/86#issuecomment-535535252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/86","id":535535252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTUzNTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T14:40:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T14:40:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fixed
