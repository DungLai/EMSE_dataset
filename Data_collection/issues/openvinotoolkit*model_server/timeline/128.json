to pile on this thread but I am having a similar issue in getting the NCS to work within a docker container (though no Kubernetes).

The docker_build_apt_ubuntu image fails to start with this message `ImportError: libpython3.5m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`. The docker_build_bin image reports `ERROR - Content error: Can not init Myriad device: NC_ERROR` Though it does appear to have some success as the entry for the NCS device (viewed from lsusb on the host) changes as it does when a model is loaded. At this point i find myself stumped as there is little difference in the container run config from an openvino/workbench:latest image i have used in which the NCS worked just fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/584214656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dcflachs","id":11656775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU2Nzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11656775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs","html_url":"https://github.com/dcflachs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcflachs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/718742191","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/128#issuecomment-718742191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/128","id":718742191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODc0MjE5MQ==","user":{"login":"rasapala","id":58549742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTQ5NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58549742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala","html_url":"https://github.com/rasapala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T13:10:41Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T13:10:41Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The support for NCS2 is now added to new OVMS version 2021.1 and the public OVMS docker image.
