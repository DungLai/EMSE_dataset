Looking at the way you send requests it seems it's the best configuration. Without parameters OVMS starts with one server thread and one CPU Stream and that's all you can utilize simply using single face_detection.py client. \r\n\r\nIt's because face_detection.py sends requests synchronously, so OVMS cannot process for example 2 images at the same time because it gets requests one by one. So even though you specified grpc_workers, nireq and CPU streams numer to be more than 1, your client doesn't take advantage of it and you end up with even worse performance than when you run model server with single thread and CPU Stream.\r\n\r\nEither way, OpenVINO uses only physical cores and from my experience, it \"divides\" physical cores into streams of 4, so I would say for your setup 1 stream is optimal and setting this numer to higher (you set 5) will be nonoptimal. To me it looks like setting `--plugin_config` causes performance difference between the two variants you posted.\r\n\r\nI would recommend:\r\n- using default plugin config,\r\n- modifying client application to send multiple requests at a time (in multiple threads or processes)\r\n- setting grpc_workers and nireq to numer at least as big as number of \"requests senders\" from previous point\r\n\r\nYou can also see what is max performance your setup can get by using desired model directly with OpenVINO (for example with benchmark app - https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/651661816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/653017628","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/278#issuecomment-653017628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/278","id":653017628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzAxNzYyOA==","user":{"login":"DanilKonon","id":29893673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODkzNjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29893673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon","html_url":"https://github.com/DanilKonon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanilKonon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T13:50:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T13:51:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So I want to use rabbitmq queue to send requests.
