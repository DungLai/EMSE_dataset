described in https://github.com/yaroslavvb/tensorflow-community-wheels/issues/103 \r\nI don't have any host without AVX at hand to test it but it should work if you replace the tensorflow dependency in the requirements section, with the pip package without avx.\r\nPlease confirm if that can work for
