For example, if the CustomLoader is configured with a config.json file that contains multiple models, the custom loader attempts to pre-load all the models, even before any of these models are called for inference.\r\n\r\nThis is designed behavior -> models are not lazy initialized but are loaded beforehand and ready for inference.\r\n> Also, what is the difference between unload and retire models? When do these get called? After every inference?\r\n\r\nBasically none - I believe unfortunately the API function names were named differently for very similar operations:\r\n`unloadModel(modelName, version)` unloads(retires) specific model version\r\n`retireModel(modelName)` should perform the same but for all model versions.\r\n\r\nI think OVMS behavior should be changed here and only use unloadModel() and not care about the others. Otherwise it basically tries to unload model version twice when using custom loader.\r\n\r\nBasically OVMS model could be in following stages:\r\nBEGIN --- beginning of model existence - even backend load operation didn't start\r\nLOADING,\r\nLOADING,ERROR\r\nAVAILABLE --- this means that model is loaded and ready for operation\r\nUNLOADING,\r\nUNLOADING,ERROR,\r\nEND   --- this means that model is unloaded/retired. Cannot be used.\r\n\r\nSome configuration changes may require partial model reload, however assumption is that since we don't know anything about specific custom loader we do full model reload in such cases - that is we unload model and then load it again.\r\n\r\nHope it helps until we improve the documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/1380199766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"atobiszei","id":36039266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM5MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36039266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei","html_url":"https://github.com/atobiszei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8253559638,"node_id":"LE_lADOCPfP385Z7ygFzwAAAAHr81NW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/8253559638","actor":{"login":"atobiszei","id":36039266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM5MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36039266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei","html_url":"https://github.com/atobiszei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-18T09:03:35Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
