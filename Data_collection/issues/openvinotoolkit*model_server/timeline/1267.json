Inference execution initiates multiple threads to take advantage of execution concurrency and multi core CPUs. By default, OpenVINO is consuming all the cores with the same number of threads.\r\nSome models, however, can not efficiently utilized all cores while some branches of the model topology are executed in sequences. That is observed especially on HW with very high number of cores. STREAMS address this challenge by executing multiple inference requests in parallel. Each stream is using a part of the overall capacity which makes the concurrency more efficient. Increasing the number of streams often improves the throughput when there are multiple inference executions in parallel. It is not recommended to set the number of streams higher from the number of cores. The optimal number of streams might depend on the model, HW capacity, expected latency and the number of parallel inference requests. It is possible to use also a simplified approach with setting just the PERFORMANCE_HINT parameter to LATENCY or THROUGHPUT. You can learn more about the performance aspect of streams on https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/blob/main/docs/python-benchmarking-client-16feb.pdf

Limiting the threads might be recommended if you need to guarantee the response time regardless of the load on the other model.\r\nOVMS is reporting in the logs the number of inference requests creating while loading the model. When --nireq parameter is not set, the number of inference requests in the logs is equal to the number of streams.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/1135858890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dtrawins","id":20400806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAwODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20400806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins","html_url":"https://github.com/dtrawins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6668655039,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCPfP385Jcg9FzwAAAAGNe5m_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/6668655039","actor":{"login":"almex-m-bulbul","id":103923667,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjG_0w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103923667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul","html_url":"https://github.com/almex-m-bulbul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-24T12:30:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6668655051,"node_id":"SE_lADOCPfP385Jcg9FzwAAAAGNe5nL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/6668655051","actor":{"login":"almex-m-bulbul","id":103923667,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjG_0w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103923667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul","html_url":"https://github.com/almex-m-bulbul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almex-m-bulbul/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-24T12:30:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6975105730,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPfP385Jcg9FzwAAAAGfv6rC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/6975105730","actor":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-12T07:23:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
