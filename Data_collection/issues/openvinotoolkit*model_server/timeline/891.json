If `frame.data()` is a numpy array then it can be used similar to what you wrote:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequest = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()\r\nrequest.inputs[\"data\"].CopyFrom(make_tensor_proto(img, shape=(img.shape)))\r\n```\r\nKeep in mind that the request you send must match the model you use. So if your frame is 512x512 and the model accepts images of size 300x300, then you might need to resize it before sending to OVMS. \r\nAlso, most models that process images have certain layout defined (NHWC, NCHW) where:\r\nN - batch size\r\nC - color channels\r\nH - image height\r\nW - image width \r\n\r\nSo your model might take inputs of shape (1,3,300,300). The frame you have might have different layout (1,300,300,3) or might not contain batch size dimension (3,300,300). Before creating the request make sure the numpy array you have matches the model input.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/909000736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5366342088,"node_id":"LE_lADOCPfP3846nWPVzwAAAAE_2-HI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/5366342088","actor":{"login":"rasapala","id":58549742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTQ5NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58549742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala","html_url":"https://github.com/rasapala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T15:07:43Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5366342714,"node_id":"CE_lADOCPfP3846nWPVzwAAAAE_2-Q6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/events/5366342714","actor":{"login":"rasapala","id":58549742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTQ5NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58549742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala","html_url":"https://github.com/rasapala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T15:07:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
