the latest public image with OVMS we prepared is actually based on centos. You could run it on a host with ubuntu16. I'm just not sure of HDDL support in such configuration because some components like drivers and hddldaemon must be installed also on the host. We were testing it so far with the same OV version on the host and the docker container. I suggest giving it a try but the safest thing would to upgrading the host to ubuntu18 to have OS covered by the OpenVINO installation package with latest HDDL drivers.
