It should be possible to run model server on everything supported by OpenVINO. \r\nIt sometimes requires some adjustments though. Our docker images do not include support for Raspberry Pi.\r\nI'd assume that to make it work with Raspberry Pi, you'd need to install OpenVINO specifically for Raspberry Pi:\r\nhttps://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_raspbian.html\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we didn't look into requirements and dependencies required to enable OVMS on Raspberry Pi.\r\nIt's something we might look into in the future, but for now that's all I know.
