Models paths and version policies set at the beginning and cannot be changed after server starts. \r\n\r\nThe only way to change what's served is with model versions. For example if you have a model in\r\n`/opt/model` with version 1 i.e. (`/opt/model/1`), then you can place another model in let's say `/opt/model/2`. In this situation, depending on that model's version policy you can: \r\n\r\n- have both versions served - for model version policy **all**\r\n- only version 2 - for model version policy **latest**\r\n\r\nServer detects adding and removing versions and updates to match model version policy\r\nFor more details on model version policy check out https://github.com/IntelAI/OpenVINO-model-server/blob/master/docs/docker_container.md#model-version-policy\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/507169362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/comments/507465719","html_url":"https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/61#issuecomment-507465719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/61","id":507465719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzQ2NTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"golisandeep3","id":4133541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzM1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4133541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3","html_url":"https://github.com/golisandeep3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golisandeep3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-01T23:53:22Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T23:54:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mzegla Are there any plans to support this feature ?
