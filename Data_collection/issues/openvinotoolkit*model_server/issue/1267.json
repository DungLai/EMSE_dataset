In order to best serve multiple inference requests executed simultaneously, the inference threads are grouped/pinned to the particular CPU cores, constituting the “CPU” streams. This provides much better performance for the networks than batching especially for the many-core machines:\r\n\r\n* **Is inference thread is different from threading in general concept of programming?**\r\n* **For setting optimal CPU_THROUGHPUT_STREAMS , can total number of streams from all model be larger than number NO_CPU_CORE?  (For example CPU_THROUGHPUT_STREAMS for all models has been set to NO_CPU_CORE)**\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mzegla","id":41325006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzI1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41325006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla","html_url":"https://github.com/mzegla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzegla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/1267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/1267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
