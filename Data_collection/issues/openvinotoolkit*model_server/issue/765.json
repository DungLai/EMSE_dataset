I want to understand the workflow of demultiplexer. It looks a little bit confusing. Because I am learning.\r\n\r\nAfter detecting the face images in this below input. There are total 10 face images in the below input. so , demultiplexer creates a total of 10 requests with the shape.\r\nNote : I had changed **demultiply_count from 0 to 10** in **config.JSON** file for better understanding of shapes of input and output of a node. It does works after change to 10.\r\n\r\nMy question is : \r\n\r\nAfter completion of face_detection node and the custom node we are resizing the face_Image to the shape of   **[10 , 1 , 64 , 64 , 3]**  and this shape is the input for the next two models age and emotion recognition. \r\n\r\nHow does it splits the requests to the next two models.? Because both models are using same inputs as [10 , 1 ,64 , 64 , 3]. I am a very confused at this stage.\r\n\r\nIt does splits 5 requests to each model or it splits 10 to each model.?\r\nLooking for response.\r\n\r\n![people1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57169077/125195711-79a6f280-e274-11eb-8aaf-8891608d597b.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"atobiszei","id":36039266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM5MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36039266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei","html_url":"https://github.com/atobiszei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atobiszei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
