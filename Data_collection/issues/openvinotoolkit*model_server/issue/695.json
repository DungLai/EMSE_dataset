For example in Openvino runtime it is possible to get the temperature of a Myriad device, it would be useful if this information was available through the model server (when a myriad device is used). \r\n\r\nAlso being able to get general usage stats could be useful, things like amount of inferences completed, average inference time. This could be split by hardware.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add this functionality?\r\n\r\nAndy","closed_by":{"login":"rasapala","id":58549742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTQ5NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58549742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala","html_url":"https://github.com/rasapala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasapala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
