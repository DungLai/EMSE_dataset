After performing sudo make docker_build command. ubuntu 20.04 image is automatically pulled instead of centos image, and due to this I am unable run build.sh file. It throws the error \"yum command not found\".\r\nAnd also one more thing, in the build.sh file line no 20. BASE_OS variable. It is BASE_OS=${3:=centos}. It should be BASE_OS=${3:-centos}. This problem has been there for a longtime. \r\nMore importantly please help me with Issue#1 wrong image pull issue, that's more pressing. And just for temporary workaround, can you please tell which centos tag image I should manually pull from docker repo. I will manually pull the image as a workaround.\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"ParthM-GitHub","id":86053144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDUzMTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86053144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub","html_url":"https://github.com/ParthM-GitHub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ParthM-GitHub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
