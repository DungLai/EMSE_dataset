But what they do is to determine from pwd what toolkit (p/fpga) is at hand and selects components in silent.cfg accordingly. I reckon such a check is a typical job for the shell's built-in case statement, which would not only increase readability but also be easier to maintain. (If, say, the components would differ between toolkit versions, handling of multiple versions is easily added as case statements.)","closed_by":{"login":"dtrawins","id":20400806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAwODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20400806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins","html_url":"https://github.com/dtrawins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtrawins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openvinotoolkit/model_server/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
