find, thank you for bringing this up! Calling `moduleNetwork` in a for loop using the provided images clocks in at around 130 ms per estimate on my 1080 Ti, still much too slow. Note to everyone reading this and who might not be aware of the asynchronous computation nature of GPU computing, making sure to use `torch.cuda.synchronize()` to get the correct timing. Have you tried benchmarking the official release? If so, what is the timing you get?
