I am using [MSi Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) to under-clock my NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super. It has a boost clock of 1680Mhz. I reduced the Core  Clock by 100 MHz. I also set the GPU Temp Limit to 76C and since the Power Limit is linked it was reduced to 88%. It has been running a few hours with no more of this error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/comments/1043475491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Etienne66","id":52262160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjYyMTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52262160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66","html_url":"https://github.com/Etienne66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Etienne66/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/comments/1043483972","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/55#issuecomment-1043483972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/55","id":1043483972,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCGqm2c4-Mk1E","user":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-17T21:46:30Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T21:46:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Oh wow, what a nightmare.

of all, thank you again @sniklaus, for making this code available. I have a workstation with 2 Nvidia 1080 Ti on it, and I still get the same error whenever I have this code running on one GPU and I try to run a separate experiment on the 2nd GPU. As a sidenote, I've never encountered this issue when trying to run any other code on both GPUs simultaneously. I think my issue is related to what @StArchon94 posted earlier:\r\n> For me, I always get this error when I am using any gpu other than gpu:0. I tried my best to make sure everything is on the same gpu device, but this error won't go away. So I ended up mapping whichever available device to gpu:0 when running docker.\r\n\r\nThis a very weird issue and can be quite problematic since I cannot debug while, say, training a model, which can take a couple of days. @StArchon94 did you end up finding a solution after all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/comments/1103157081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tsogkas","id":7347997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDc5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7347997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas","html_url":"https://github.com/tsogkas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsogkas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6458293315,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCGqm2c4-iG_6zwAAAAGA8bxD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/events/6458293315","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T20:54:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6458293322,"node_id":"SE_lADOCGqm2c4-iG_6zwAAAAGA8bxK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/events/6458293322","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T20:54:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6458293330,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCGqm2c4-iG_6zwAAAAGA8bxS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/events/6458293330","actor":{"login":"StArchon94","id":7736732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzY3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7736732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94","html_url":"https://github.com/StArchon94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StArchon94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T20:54:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6458293334,"node_id":"SE_lADOCGqm2c4-iG_6zwAAAAGA8bxW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/events/6458293334","actor":{"login":"StArchon94","id":7736732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzY3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercon
