I agree with you that, based on intuition, one would expect a network trained on FlyingThings3D to do reasonably well on a synthetic driving dataset. However, the types of motion in FlyingThings3D are probably quite different from a camera mounted to a (virtual) car driving through a city. So intuition goes both ways. I am afraid that I do not have any recommendation on how to improve the poor performance that you are experiencing. Note that this repository is a reimplementation of PWC-Net and you could try to reach out to the PWC-Net authors (Deqing et al.) as well to see what they have to say. Alternatively you could also give another method a try (but your mileage may vary): https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/comments/770323572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4269915387,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI2OTkxNTM4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/events/4269915387","actor":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-31T04:26:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
