I am guessing that is because `rbot0` and `rbot1` have only zeros at the place in code the `save_for_backward` was before. I haven't finished training my model which uses your model on as well but it is definitely taking longer and using the CPU a lot more. I'm guessing that is because the `backward` finally has some data for `rbot0` and `rbot1`.\r\n\r\nNot sure why you don't like putting comments in your code nor in your commits as to why something was changed but a lot of PHD students seem to be that way. I'm a programmer and I get chewed out by my boss if I do that. Oh well... I really do appreciate you improving your code so I can't complain too much :smile:","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
