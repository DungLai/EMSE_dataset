I suffered a problem when I tried to use your model as an optical flow prediction component of my model. I simplify the issue as below:\r\n```\r\nt1 = torch.randn((16,3,256,256))\r\nt2 = torch.randn((16,3,256,256))\r\ninput = Network()(t1, t2)\r\ninput.backward()\r\n```\r\nIt will raise \"RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn\" on the backward line. Does it mean there is somewhere non-differentiable inside the network? How can I deal with this if I just want to use the output to train other models?","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
