This means that I need to back-propagate gradients of the flow w.r.t fake video frames. \r\n\r\nHowever I found in your correlation package the backward function is not implemented:\r\n```\r\ndef backward(self, gradOutput):\r\n\t\tfirst, second = self.saved_tensors\r\n\r\n\t\tassert(gradOutput.is_contiguous() == True)\r\n\r\n\t\tgradFirst = first.new_zeros(first.size(0), first.size(1), first.size(2), first.size(3)) if self.needs_input_grad[0] == True else None\r\n\t\tgradSecond = first.new_zeros(first.size(0), first.size(1), first.size(2), first.size(3)) if self.needs_input_grad[1] == True else None\r\n\r\n\t\tif first.is_cuda == True:\r\n\t\t\traise NotImplementedError()\r\n\r\n\t\telif first.is_cuda == False:\r\n\t\t\traise NotImplementedError()\r\n\r\n\t\t# end\r\n\r\n\t\treturn gradFirst, gradSecond\r\n\t# end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find that the officical PWC-Net implementation provided a complete correlation package, but I'm not quite sure how to incorporated it to your project.
