I managed to get the model overfit to one sample, using a batch size of 1. But when moving on to fine tuning the pretrained models and using a batch size different than 1, argument `second` in `_FunctionCorrelation` is not contiguous. I guess one option is to do `second.contiguous()`. But I was curious as to why this is happening. I've roughly spotted that function `Backward` returns a non-contiguous tensor (when batch size != 1). Let me know if this had happened to you before, or if maybe it's some issue from my side. \r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: in particular, it's this [line](https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/blob/f6138900578214ab4e3daef6743b88f7824293be/run.py#L65):\r\n```\r\ntensorMask = tensorOutput[:, -1:, :, :]\r\n```\r\nthat is causing the output of `Backward` to not be contiguous when the batch size is not 1, which makes sense, since slicing can cause this (see this [thread](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-ops-make-a-tensor-non-contiguous/3676))\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/35/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
