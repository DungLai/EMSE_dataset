I am just wondering if you have tested PWC's performance on synthetic driving dataset(https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html). \r\nIn theory, PWC's performance should be good on this dataset, given that initial training of PWC is on FlyingThings3D. However, on this dataset, performance on syntheic driving is about 28, which is very large. \r\nDo you have any clue? \r\n\r\nI am looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sniklaus","id":1238034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus","html_url":"https://github.com/sniklaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sniklaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
