Second, \"Finding 90 nearest neighbors using auto search\" sounds a little unhelpful; it would be better it it said \"Finding 90 nearest neighbors using annoy search\". For this, the verbose=1 should probably be passed into `build_knn_index()` and it should print the message after the method is resolved. Third, there is a typo in \"Calcualting affinity matrix\".\r\n\r\nAlso, you might a separate `===>` entry for initialization. At least with `spectral` it can take some time, but I guess `pca` on a large dataset can also take some non-negligible time.","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
