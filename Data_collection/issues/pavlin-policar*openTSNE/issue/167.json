Shuffling the data beforehand causes the data points in each class to be evenly mixed without separation in the result.\r\n\r\nI think it would be helpful to at least include an option to shuffle data before processing it, because it was not clear that input order would affect the output.","closed_by":{"login":"califyn","id":50273066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjczMDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50273066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn","html_url":"https://github.com/califyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/califyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
