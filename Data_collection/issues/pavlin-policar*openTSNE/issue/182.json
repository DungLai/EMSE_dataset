Suddenly I got a KeyError. It seems that for larger DataFrames openTSNE brekas down (other than sklearn). This minimal example will reproduce the error:\r\n```\r\nfrom openTSNE import TSNE\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(2000, 4)), \r\n                  columns=list('ABCD'))\r\n\r\ntsne = TSNE()\r\n\r\n## adding this line solves the problem entirely\r\n# df  = df.to_numpy()\r\n\r\n## this works\r\ntsne.fit(df[:500])\r\n\r\n## this doesn't work\r\ntsne.fit(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea what could cause this, and whether it's worth while to extend openTSNE for pandas DataFrames?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
