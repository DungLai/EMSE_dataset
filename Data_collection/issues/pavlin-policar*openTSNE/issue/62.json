Why? This looks unintuitive to me: exaggeration is a slightly \"weird\" trick that can arguably be very useful for huge data sets, but I would expect the out-of-sample embedding to work just fine with it. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nI am also curious why momentum is set to 0 (unlike in normal tSNE optimization), but here I don't have any intuition for what it should be.\r\n\r\nAnother question is: will this function work with `n_iter=0` if one just wants to get an embedding using medians of k nearest neighbours? That would be handy. Or is there another way to get this? Perhaps from `prepare_partial`?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, when transform() is applied to points from a very different data set (imagine positioning Smart-seq2 cells onto a 10x Chromium reference), I prefer to use correlation distances because I suspect Euclidean distances might be completely off (even when the original tSNE was done using Euclidean distances). I think openTSNE currently does not support this, right? Did you have any problems with that? One could perhaps allow `transform()` to take a `metric` argument (is `correlation` among the supported metrics, btw?). The downside is that if this metric is different from the metric used to prepare the embedding, then the nearest neighbours object will have to be recomputed, so it will suddenly become much slower. Let me know if I should post it as a separate issue.","closed_by":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
