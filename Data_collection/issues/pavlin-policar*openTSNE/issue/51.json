Have you already seen https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05804 by any chance? I thought you might be interested to add a `df` parameter to openTSNE. It was really easy to implement it in FIt-SNE so I guess it should be pretty easy here as well. I would even consider doing it myself, but alas, I am _so_ caught in revisions right now (including revising this paper) that I am not sure when I would have time for it...\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you don't want to implement it (at least not until our paper is out in some reputable place haha) then it's fine. Do let me know if you have any comments on the preprint though.","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/51/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
