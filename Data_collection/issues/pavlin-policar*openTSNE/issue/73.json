How does one verify that it's installed correctly and usable by openTSNE?  I followed the instructions for Ubuntu [here](http://micro.stanford.edu/wiki/Install_FFTW3),  namely `apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc`, and I see /usr/include/fftw3.h et al. Does this mean I have fftw3 installed correctly for openTSNE?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/73/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
