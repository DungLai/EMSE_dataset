I remember reading that UMAP does support them, so I assume `pynndescent` should, but I did not look deeper into that.\r\n\r\nI also wonder how efficient `pynndescent` for huge sparse matrices is, compared e.g. to https://github.com/facebookresearch/pysparnn that I found by googling `approximate nearest neighbour sparse`. I also came across this https://github.com/RUSH-LAB/Flash, described here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01190.pdf. Don't know what other libraries are there.\r\n\r\nThis isn't very useful for single cell transcriptomics, but is relevant for text-based datasets with millions of samples and millions (!) of features.","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
