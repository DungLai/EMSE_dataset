It works flawlessly when the argument is less than 12:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTSNE(exaggeration=4).fit(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I want to use a value above 12, e.g. 24 (this rarely happens but I ran into this situation just now), then I am doing smth like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTSNE(exaggeration=24, early_exaggeration=24, learning_rate = X.shape[0]/24).fit(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a little annoying, and cumbersome to communicate to practitioners who are less familiar with inner working of t-SNE. I would love to be able to simply run\r\n\r\n```\r\nTSNE(exaggeration=24).fit(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am wondering if we can somehow change the default behaviour, so that this works by default. For example, we could have `early_exaggeration='auto'` by default, so that `auto` defaults to 12 unless exaggeration is above 12. And set the \"auto\" learning rate accordingly. This is admittedly an edge use case... But I don't really see downsides.
