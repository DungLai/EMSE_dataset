Scanpy has a smart internal setup where the same kNN graph is used for various downstream analysis tasks such as dimensionality reduction or clustering. AFAIK it uses pynndescent for kNN construction. For dimensionality reduction it supports UMAP and t-SNE and even supports FIt-SNE if it's installed (I think), but then of course FIt-SNE needs to rebuild its own kNN graph. It seems it would be much better to actually use openTSNE that can directly re-use the pre-built kNN graph object.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I haven't used scanpy that much myself, but I see it's getting more and more popular in the community. So in the interest of the ecosystem I think it'd be great to transition it to openTSNE. \r\n\r\nI imagine that integrating the core t-SNE should be relatively straightforward. One could then think of implementing some \"recipes\" from our Nat Comms paper on top of that as additional functions, if the scanpy team is interested in that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I have zero time for it right now due to some looming deadlines but could imagine investing some time into it later in spring.","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
