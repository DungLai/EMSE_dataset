However, it seems that openTSNE is not compatible with newer versions of Numpy. I don't know if that is an issue, or if I'm supposed to build it on my machine. \r\n\r\n##### Actual behaviour\r\nGet this message when importing anything from openTSNE: \r\n\r\n> ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject\r\n\r\n##### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\nOpenning a Jupyter notebook and running the code:\r\n`from openTSNE import TSNE`\r\n\r\n**Remarks**\r\n1. Numpy version  1.21.5  py39h7a5d4dd_2\r\n2. opentsne version     0.6.2    py39h79cecc1_0\r\n3. I read that openTSNE 0.6.2 is build with oldest-supported-numpy. Does it mean I should build it on my machine. I appologize if my rased issue is not really an issue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/213/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
