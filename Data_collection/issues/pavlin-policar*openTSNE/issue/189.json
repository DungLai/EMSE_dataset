Since the documentation says that is accepts both an integer and a numpy random state, I guess this is a (tiny) bug.\r\n\r\n##### Expected behaviour\r\nIt sets a seed for the internal random state of annoy.\r\n\r\n##### Actual behaviour\r\nIt crashes with a TypeError:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  File \"/home/jnb/dev/openTSNE/openTSNE/nearest_neighbors.py\", line 276, in build\r\n    self.index.set_seed(self.random_state)\r\nTypeError: an integer is required (got type numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom openTSNE import PerplexityBasedNN\r\n\r\nrandom_state = np.random.default_rng(333)\r\ndata = random_state.uniform(size=(10000,10))\r\nPerplexityBasedNN(rdata, andom_state=random_state)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Fix \r\nin `nearest_neighbors.py` line 275 can be changed from `self.index.set_seed(self.random_state)` to\r\n```python\r\n        if isinstance(self.random_state, int):\r\n            self.index.set_seed(self.random_state)\r\n        else: # has to be a numpy RandomState\r\n            self.index.set_seed(self.random_state.randint(-(2 ** 31), 2 ** 31))\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if it should come as a pull request or if you'll just incorporate it like this.
