For example, Orange pypi download, for example, is supported until 10.9. As is numpy's. I found about 10.14 limit when trying to build some installers on travis with older MacOS.\r\n\r\n10.14 seems like a high limit. There are surely still some users on older platforms; 10.13 is even still officially supported. Or are there any technological reasons for this decision?\r\n\r\nI am not sure what now happens to Orange3 users that use its official dmg on older Macs... They won't get install warnings because packages there are already extracted, which is good. I only hope it does not crash while usage.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
