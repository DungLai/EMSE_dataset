I usually fix them such that the sum of eigenvector values is positive (of course some other conventions could work equally well). My suggestion is to insert this snippet\r\n\r\n```\r\n# fix PC signs\r\nflipSigns = np.sum(pca_.components_, axis=1) < 0\r\nembedding[:, flipSigns] *= -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nin here https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/initialization.py#L57.\r\n\r\nBy the way, why not add `svd_solver='auto'` parameter to `initialization.pca()` and pass it into the sklearn `PCA` call? Could be convenient IMHO.","closed_by":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
