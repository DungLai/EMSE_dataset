Sklearn yields this. \r\n\r\n##### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nUsing openTSNE the terminal crashes with full memory (50% of the time). If it survives the clusters are visible, however the result is not as satisfying. \r\n\r\n##### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nmatrix = Block matrix\r\ntsne = TSNE(metric='precomputed', initialization='spectral', negative_gradient_method='bh')\r\nembedding = tsne.fit(matrix)\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am using the direct installation from GitHub this morning.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
