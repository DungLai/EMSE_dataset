I was rather thinking of an opposite approach, where you would have \"exact\" modules in the standard openTSNE architecture. Thinking a bit more about it now, it could be `negative_gradient_method='exact'` (in addition to BH and FFT) and `neighbors='exact-dense'` (we already have `exact` but that's not enough because it computes sparse affinities; whereas `exact-dense` would compute dense affinities).\r\n\r\nHowever, I agree that the value of this is questionable.
