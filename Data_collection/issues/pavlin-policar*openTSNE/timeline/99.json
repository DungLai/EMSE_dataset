The time complexity is actually exponential in the number of dimensions, while still being linear in the number of data points. It's definitely possible, but it would probably be pretty slow. The Barnes-Hut approximation would also take a performance hit, but probably not as much, but that scales O(N log N).\r\n2. plotting things in 3-d is almost never a good idea. These plots are difficult to inspect, you can't print them on paper, and I suspect, leads to overinterpreting t-SNE plots even more than usual.\r\n\r\nThis is not something I will be adding in the foreseeable future, and, if you really want 3d t-SNE plots, I believe scikit-learn supports up to 3 dimensions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/557829405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2825553669,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgyNTU1MzY2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/events/2825553669","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-23T20:15:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/557838358","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/99#issuecomment-557838358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/99","id":557838358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzgzODM1OA==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T22:24:44Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T22:24:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By the way, have you seen this: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05582.pdf?
