While the expected usage is definitely to use numpy arrays, I am somewhat surprised this doesn't work. However, looking at the logs, the error makes sense -- pandas indexing is different from numpy.\r\n\r\nThe main goal is a mostly similar interface to scikit-learn, so I'll check how they handle it. I definitely won't add pandas as a hard dependency for this use case alone and the fix should be entirely trivial, passing `df.values` instead of just `df`, which, in my experience, is also quite standard in the Python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'm glad you figured it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/643825757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
