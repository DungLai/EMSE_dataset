You can probably achieve this by reinstalling openTSNE using pip, or if you've cloned the repository, `python setup.py install`. The compilation will produce a lot of output, but you want to look for a line that says\r\n\r\n> FFTW3 header files found. Using FFTW implementation of FFT.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that it's compiling against FFTW3 and not numpy. Also, if you're in this deep, you'll also want to verify that it's compiling with openmp flags - look for a similar message in the compilation output. This is much more important since, without openmp, opentsne will only be able to use one core. Almost all compilers support this, with the exception of some older mac versions of clang, and I guess the fix there is to just download a newer version of clang.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any further questions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/507535867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/507568256","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/73#issuecomment-507568256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/73","id":507568256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzU2ODI1Ng==","user":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T08:05:48Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T08:05:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Perfect, thanks! That worked. I got the lines saying that the FFTW3 headers were found and that it compiled with openmp.\r\n\r\nJust in case it's useful to others, apt was not a good way to install fftw3, at least with miniconda, which the apt command seems to have wrecked. I had been meaning to upgrade to anaconda anyway, used that to install [fftw3](https://anaconda.org/eumetsat/fftw3), then cloned and installed openTSNE as you suggested. Vroom vroom.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and also for adding to the tSNE universe the ability to reapply an embedding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/507568256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2453473219,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ1MzQ3MzIxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/events/2453473219","actor":{"login":"bzip2","id":12174276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0Mjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2","html_url":"https://github.com/bzip2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzip2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T08:05:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
