Neither of the nearest neighbor methods used support it. For exact search, scikit-learn uses brute force for sparse matrices (so very slow) and pynndescent apparently doesn't support it at all (as per your issue). Ideally, we would need an exact and approximate search method for sparse data - I don't like the idea of supporting one type of search and not the other.\r\n\r\nIt is also fairly straightforward to replace the KNN libraries with anything else - you just need to subclass the `Affinity` class and you can compute affinities in any way you want. This isn't documented anywhere yet, but the functionality is already there. A simple example would be\r\n\r\n```python\r\naffinities = MySparseAffinities(X, ...)\r\ninitialization = init_scheme.pca(X, n_components=2)\r\nembedding = TSNEEmbedding(initialization, affinities, perplexity=50, learning_rate=500)\r\nembedding.optimize(250, exaggeration=12, momentum=0.5, inplace=True)\r\nembedding.optimize(750, momentum=0.8, inplace=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also remember hearing somewhere that t-SNE doesn't scale well with dimensions (I've got no references or anything to back this up, just word of mouth) and if that is the case, I don't know how useful t-SNE might be at all.

I suppose, in this case, it may not be reasonable, so I suppose I'd be alright if an informative error was raised. And even then, some metrics aren't supported and it all becomes very messy.\r\n\r\nIn any case, one of the requirements for anything we include here is that it's easily installable and distributable, at least through conda if not through pypi. pysparnn would be easier to incorporate given that it's in pure python. However, it's not on pypi and really only supports cosine distance well. It also includes euclidean distance, but the docstring says that it's slow. Flash is C++ so we'd have to include cython bindings to it, and add it to the conda recipe in order to compile it.\r\n\r\nSince UMAP supports sparse data with pynndescent, I guess it may most straightforward to just figure out what they changed and incorporate that here as well.\r\n\r\nI'm open to supporting sparse data in some reasonable way, but it's not high on my list of priorities here. I think I've made the Affinities API fairly extensible so it's easy to use something like this (after I properly document it).

I've noticed that without doing some kind of dimensionality reduction before t-SNE I'd often get meaningless embeddings, but after doing some feature selection or PCA that would be fixed. That kind of seems to be in line with saying that t-SNE doesn't scale well to high dimensions, so I don't know...

Thankfully, we don't support 32 bit systems any more, so depending on it outright is the much better option.\r\n\r\nSo there are two options: \r\n1.

Remove the current implementation and properly depend on `pynndescent`, then wait for a release where the sparse support will be added.\r\n\r\nThe second is definitely the way to go, but will require waiting for them to make a release. If you want to play around with it straight away, the first method is definitely much simpler.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAFAIK, to build and distribute a conda package (which openTSNE is), all the dependencies need to be available on some conda channel. Unfortunately, I don't think `pynndescent` is a conda package, so 2. is out of the question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/480598174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/480599570","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/28#issuecomment-480599570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/28","id":480599570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDU5OTU3MA==","user":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-07T15:23:28Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T15:23:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"However, it's also worth mentioning that we are considering replacing `pynndescent` with something faster.

address my previous comment:\r\n\r\n>have been slow was because I was calling it incorrectly\r\n\r\nThis was not the case. I had been calling it properly. But I had found the following (if memory serves):\r\n- building the index for a lot of neighbors is slower than annoy\r\n- however, querying seems to be quite fast\r\n- so, I build the index on 15 neighbors (so it's fairly fast) and query the missing neighbors that we need for t-SNE (so the standard 30 perplexity will query 90 neighbors on an index built on 15 neighbors).\r\n\r\nI compared the results against building the entire index on 90 neighbors and I couldn't see any difference. If this seems problematic, it's fairly simple to implement a KNN index and use that.\r\n\r\nTo address sparse support: As of 40d721b819146067b030b8d752b3c2871d2be568 we properly depend on `pynndescent`. However, sparse support in the release seems highly unstable and I haven't been able to get a single example working with sparse input.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the parallelization works properly though.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer directly an openTSNE issue, but a `pynndescent` issue, so I'm closing this. I see they've fixed a couple bugs from the last release, so hopefully, they get that sorted out asap. @dkobak I have made it very easy to extend the library so if you want to use some other algorithm that supports sparse data, you just need to extend [`KNNIndex`](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/nearest_neighbors.py#L7-L51) and use that as the `neighbors` parameter.
