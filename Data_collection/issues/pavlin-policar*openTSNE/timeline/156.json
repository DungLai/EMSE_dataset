Intuitively, I don't think it should really affect them much, because the perplexity of the distribution can be calculated on any number of samples. I would assume that just the accuracy would suffer if we used too few samples i.e. the kernel bandwidths might be estimated incorrectly. Not that I think this would be problematic, since the uniform kernel works just as well.\r\n\r\nI think this is something we will have to add to accomodate the scanpy use-case, but we'll have to figure out what parameter value combinations are reasonable. 3\\*k is hard-coded because it makes sense. Neighbors further than the 3*k nearest neighbors will be assigned a practically zero value, so parameter combinations like `perplexity=30, k=500` should be heavily discouraged. On the other hand, running something like `perplexity=500, k=30` would make no sense and would lead to incorrect results.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, something like\r\n```python\r\nif k > 3 * perplexity:\r\n    warn\r\nelif k < perplexity * 2:\r\n    error or at least warn\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/770262191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/770284937","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/156#issuecomment-770284937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/156","id":770284937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDI4NDkzNw==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-30T21:41:43Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T21:42:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's mathematically impossible to obtain perplexity larger than the number of neighbors.
