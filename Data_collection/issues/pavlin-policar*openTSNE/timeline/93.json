As such, I would be very hesitant to add anything that ties openTSNE even closer to `pynndescent`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be fairly simple to achieve what you want. I've made it so that the `neighbors` parameter can be an instance of [`openTSNE.nearest_neighbors.KNNIndex`](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/nearest_neighbors.py#L8), so you can just copy over the `NNDescent` class and remove the check that disallows custom metrics. You can probably just change `check_metric` to return `True` and I'd guess that would do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/526814562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2598747430,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1OTg3NDc0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/events/2598747430","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-31T09:10:47Z","label":{"name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/526816591","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/93#issuecomment-526816591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/93","id":526816591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjgxNjU5MQ==","user":{"login":"jgraving","id":5445636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5445636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving","html_url":"https://github.com/jgraving","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgraving/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-31T09:37:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-31T09:37:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I wasn't clear. I'm not suggesting you tie `openTSNE` closer to `pynndescent`. Passing a callable metric is a standard feature for many packages. `scikit-learn` also allows it for many of their algorithms, including their implementation of `TSNE`. Adding a check if `metric` is callable is fairly straightforward. If you're short of time/motivation then I can make a PR once I have time to look through the code. You're of course free to reject it, but I think this is a reasonable feature to have for a t-SNE implementation and would be potentially useful to quite a few people.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to apply `openTSNE` to use these methods for analyzing animal behavior: \r\nhttps://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2014.0672\r\nas an example analysis for my recently developed package:\r\nhttps://github.com/jgraving/behavelet\r\nApplying t-SNE to these data requires using KL-divergence as a distance metric between normalized time-frequency vectors. If accomplishing that requires that users subclass and modify your code to get it working then I will likely just find something else, as I'd like it to be straightforward for people to use.\r\n\r\nAgain, I appreciate the work you've done on this.

I see. Sorry I assumed you were familiar with numba as it's one of the main dependencies for pynndescent. numba is a library that JIT-compiles pure python/numpy functions to make them faster, so a numba compiled function works just like any other python function in practice. scikit-learn's `BallTree` accepts user-defined functions, which includes numba compiled functions. Here is an example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import BallTree\r\nfrom numba import njit\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n@njit(fastmath=True)\r\ndef l1(x, y):\r\n    return np.sum(np.abs(x - y))\r\n\r\ntree = BallTree(np.random.normal(size=(1000,10)), metric=l1)\r\ndistances, indices = tree.query(np.random.normal(size=(100,10)), k=5)\r\n```\r\nThe only issue I can see is if the function isn't numba compiled and it's passed to pynndescent then pynndescent will throw an uninformative error message from numba. Whether or how to deal with this might require some thought, or maybe just make clear in the docstring and leave this for pynndescent to deal with. I assume if the user is savvy enough to pass a custom metric then they'd expect error messages are a possibility.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at the code and submit a PR with the changes.

otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/526861737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/527606196","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/93#issuecomment-527606196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/93","id":527606196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzYwNjE5Ng==","user":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T19:33:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T19:33:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Fixed
