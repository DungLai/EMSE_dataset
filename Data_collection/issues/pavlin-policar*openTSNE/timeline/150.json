We build the packages on Azure Pipelines, and the earliest version of MacOS they support is 10.14 ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#software)). GH actions, for example, only provides VM images for 10.15 ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners)), so that's even worse. The earliest MacOS VM I've been able to find is on Travis, and is 10.11 ([docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/)). I guess Orange is built on Travis.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I want to go changing the build pipeline for this unless it's absolutely necessary. I would kind of expect Travis to eventually follow suit and drop older versions as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/734405954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/734449916","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/150#issuecomment-734449916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/150","id":734449916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDQ0OTkxNg==","user":{"login":"markotoplak","id":552182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/552182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak","html_url":"https://github.com/markotoplak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markotoplak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-26T19:18:46Z","updated_at":"2020-11-26T19:21:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Perhaps see https://github.com/ales-erjavec/orange3-wheels/.
