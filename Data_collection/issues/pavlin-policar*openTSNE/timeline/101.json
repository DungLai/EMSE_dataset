Can one profile openTSNE and see how much time is taken by different steps, such as repulsive/attractive computations?\r\n\r\nYes, it's possible to benchmark this, but it's a little involved. You can add the `# cython: profile=True` directives to the cython files, then compile the thing from source by running `python setup.py develop`. Then you can get reports with cProfile, which is the default one if you're using pycharm. It's been a while since I've done any benchmarking, but from what I remember, neither of the attractive or repulsive forces \"dominated\" the runtime and I spent quite a bit optimizing the computation of the attractive forces to use as little instructions as possible.\r\n\r\nI fear there isn't all that much I can do to make it faster since the generated C code from cython is a lot, and there is a lot of overhead to switching between compiled cython code and python compared to pure C++.\r\n\r\n> Apart from that, and possibly even more worryingly, I replicated the data 6x and added some noise, to get a 420000x50 data matrix. It takes FIt-SNE around 1Gb of RAM to allocate the space for the kNN matrix, so it works just fine on my laptop. However, openTSNE rapidly took >7Gb of RAM and crashed the kernel (I have 16 Gb but around half was taken by other processes). This happened in the first seconds, so I assume it happens during the kNN search. Does pynndescent eat up so much memory in this case?\r\n\r\nThis has been my suspicion for a long time actually. I haven't really run into this myself because I typically work on large RAM machines when doing any actual work, but I've been told this does happen. Unfortunately, for the time being, we still rely on pynndescent, which seems to be the source of almost all my problems with openTSNE. I would really like to replace this with something that doesn't use numba, but I haven't really found any good alternative. Numba makes it so easy to use custom metrics and it is easy to install that there's really nothing like it. I've considered switching to annoy several times since it also seems to be faster, but nothing has come of it yet, and from what I remember, it was a pain to package.\r\n\r\nIf you do go into the code and find improvements, PRs are always welcome ðŸ˜„","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571110315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571121918","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101#issuecomment-571121918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101","id":571121918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTEyMTkxOA==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T12:32:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T12:32:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm trying to understand the RAM usage of pynndescent a bit better here: https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent/issues/90.

I should really follow twitter more often, I just saw that your new preprint on UMAP initialization. Very interesting work.\r\n\r\nTo be quite honest, pynndescent is amazing. As you said, custom metrics, sparse matrices, it's quite fast, IMO it's probably the best library for ANN search.\r\n\r\nHowever, numba is a huge dependency (it bloats our Orange installer by 40MB or so) and seems unstable. For example, just last week one of my colleagues got segfaults when running some data through pynndescent. Removing a couple of samples fixed it. Totally bizarre stuff, and totally difficult to debug. On my new mac, I get some strange errors that I haven't had the time yet to debug. Specifying the number of jobs is a mystery and I can't ever seem to get it to use the right number of threads. 0.4 broke backward-compatibility, which makes me weary of depending on them as now I have to worry that every new release will break something (now that UMAP depends on them instead of using their own internal implementation, I hope they'll be better about this).\r\n\r\n> What's the problem with using annoy?\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember, annoy has a very limited python interface, and the only way to add samples to the index is to do it in a for-loop. The same goes for retrieving the distances and nearest neighbors. For-loops are slow in python so I worry this silly overhead would take a lot of time. But it might not be that big a deal. We'd really just need to try it. It should be very simple to write a `KNNIndex` for annoy and benchmark that. It's nice because it supports cosine distance, but it's a lot more limited than pynndescent.\r\n\r\n> Oh, regarding building the index vs querying (the twitter conversation linked above), ...\r\n\r\nIf they've made substantial changes to how the index is built, it might make sense to build the index with the proper number of neighbors now.

Right now not many projects that I know of were explicitly depending on pynndescent so I thought it was better to get the changes made earlier. Hopefully things will stabilise from here. The multi-threading is still a complicated story since there are multiple multi-threading mechanisms in play. One, written by Tom White, is very powerful and scales up very well; however it doesn't scale down that well (for 4 cores it is, at best, break even in performance, and worse for fewer) and is certainly memory intensive. The 0.4 version introduces a numba based parallel implementation that does not scale up as well, but works well for the 1-8 core range, and uses a lot less memory. Ideally I would like to move to that long term, but the numba parallel options are not quite there yet (they are coming).\r\n\r\nAs for breakage with numba -- yes, it seems like the 0.47 version has introduced some recent issues as well.

As for breaking changes in publicly available software, it's generally best practice to have a grace period where you'd raise some `DeprecationWarning`s for one version, then remove it in the next. This is what we do in Orange, and this way, we give anyone depending on our software a couple of weeks to adapt their code to the new API.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this must be equally frustrating to you since I imagine most of your problems are also caused by numba updates. As I said, I think pynndescent is a great piece of software, but it's quite unreliable because things seem to break quite often. \r\n\r\n> It is frustrating, but on the other hand it is far easier to write an maintain python using numba than what would be required to get similar performance any other way (Cython, or straight C++).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I agree. It seems to me that numba is still quite immature and if I constantly have to return to openTSNE to fix bugs introduced by some downstream dependency, this does not scream _easy to maintain_ to me. I would much rather have a stable piece of software written in C++ which might have taken a bit longer to develop, but it will be faster and more stable. I haven't made changes to the core openTSNE code in probably about a year, yet I find myself constantly returning to it to fix some bug or implement some workaround for numba or figuring out which versions work and which don't.\r\n\r\nI apologize if I sound a little frustrated, but I've just returned from holiday to find failing tests with cryptic numba error messages which aren't even part of my code.\r\n\r\nSo as not to completely derail this issue, it's my understanding that the `low_memory` parameter in pynndescent will determine which of the two multithreading algorithms will be used. Is that correct? If so, I suppose the easiest way to address Dmitry's original issue would be to default to using the new less-memory intensive version. I would guess most people are running things on their PCs where they rarely have more than 8 cores available. And for the people running things on cpu nodes, adding a parameter to switch to the memory-hungry algorithm should be totally fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571298694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571518571","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101#issuecomment-571518571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101","id":571518571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTUxODU3MQ==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T10:00:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T10:00:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So as not to completely derail this issue, it's my understanding that the `low_memory` parameter in `pynndescent` will determine which of the two multithreading algorithms will be used.

The low memory option still turns it off, but it is much less likely to have as dramatic an effect on memory usage in comparison to previous versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571752555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lmcinnes","id":11962885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTYyODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11962885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes","html_url":"https://github.com/lmcinnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571754735","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101#issuecomment-571754735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101","id":571754735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTc1NDczNQ==","user":{"login":"lmcinnes","id":11962885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTYyODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11962885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes","html_url":"https://github.com/lmcinnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmcinnes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T20:21:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T20:21:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pavlin-policar : Sorry for the problems I have apparently caused.

The part that doesn't make sense is that when we set `n_jobs=1`, it will use a different algorithm which uses less memory, but will still use multiple cores (as set by the numba environmental variable). So unless the user actually knows to set the environmental variable to 1, there really is no way to use a single core. And this requires knowledge about how the library works, which the average user does not. I would call this unreasonable behaviour, because it's complicated and very surprising -- one would expect that setting the number of jobs to 1 would actually result in a single core being used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/572462769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/585146406","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101#issuecomment-585146406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/101","id":585146406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTE0NjQwNg==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T10:47:57Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T10:47:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So thinking this over again, I think the best course of action might be to add Annoy support and make it default for dense inputs and all metrics that Annoy supports (of course assuming that it is not slower; this one would need to check).
