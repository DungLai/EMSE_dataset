This fits to George's example that was not sparse but was also high-dimensional.\r\n\r\nI could prepare a PR. Should `max_step_norm` be available via API or directly built-in? (e.g. UMAP does not allow to control via API). I'd say yes it should. If yes, should it be turned on by default? I would suggest so. Having both `max_grad_norm` and `max_step_norm` might be excessive, but won't really hurt anything either. And `max_grad_norm=None` by default anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/626152494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/626155103","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/132#issuecomment-626155103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/132","id":626155103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjE1NTEwMw==","user":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-09T11:34:09Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T11:34:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> Should max_step_norm be available via API or directly built-in?\r\n\r\nI don't see anything wrong with it being public, but using a sensible default.
