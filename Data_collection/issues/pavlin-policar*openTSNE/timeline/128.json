With wheels you get a binary which you can use straight away. Why wheels? Because some people (mainly windows folks) don't have a C compiler installed, or they might not have the appropriate libraries. Without a compiler, the sdist is useless to them, but a wheel will run straight away. Conda is similar to wheels, where it builds the package on their servers. When you run conda install x you get the prebuilt binary which you can use straight away, without needing to compile locally.\r\n\r\nIn both FIt-SNE and openTSNE FFTW needs to be available at compile-time, when the binaries are being built. So for your example above, running `conda install fftw` would pull down the binary for fftw and `conda install openTSNE` would pull down the binary for openTSNE. This is already compiled somewhere else, so having the FFTW thing doesn't do anything. However, if you compiled from source i.e. `python setup.py install` or even `pip install openTSNE` (assuming it pulls down the sdist and not the wheels) after `conda install fftw` then compilation would occur locally on your computer, and it could use the FFTW headers.\r\n\r\nHopefully, that clears things up a bit. Don't hold me to all the details, but conceptually, that's how it works 😄 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/624096336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/624151020","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/128#issuecomment-624151020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/128","id":624151020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDE1MTAyMA==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-05T16:14:24Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T16:14:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Again, this was on a Xeon processor, so I'd like to run this on laptop computers as well before making any definitive statements. \r\n\r\nInteresting.

Ideally, annoy would include a conda binary for windows (which they currently don't), as well as wheels (which they currently don't).

bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/625880844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3317462774,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzMxNzQ2Mjc3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/events/3317462774","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-08T15:49:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/626036995","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/128#issuecomment-626036995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/128","id":626036995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjAzNjk5NQ==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T21:52:37Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T21:52:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

that the speed increase on some systems can be noticeable even earlier than with \"millions\" of points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/626036995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
