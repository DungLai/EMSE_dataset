Other sizes are computed by means of a slow, general-purpose algorithm (which nevertheless retains O(n log n) performance even for prime sizes).

I think this looks better, no? There are still a few spikes, but those might be explained away due to other things your system is doing. Anyways, does this fix your problem?\r\n\r\nI have played around a bit with changing the number of interpolation points, but I think the current setting is very reasonable. For example, if I fixed the number of intervals to e.g. 50 and have the intervals expand with the embedding, the final embedding would exhibit banding at the box boundaries. 100 intervals seemed to work fine, but I let it run for a while so the embedding would have a larger span, and I saw some banding there as well. Interestingly enough, the banding was more severe in the standard perplexity based affinities than uniform affinities (or it could be the other way around -- I forgot).\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that we might be able to play with the number of intervals and fine tune it, but the gains would be marginal. The current setting seems pretty good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/821821571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/821821999","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/174#issuecomment-821821999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/174","id":821821999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTgyMTk5OQ==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-17T13:23:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-17T13:23:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
