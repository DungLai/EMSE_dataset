Ideally, annoy would support pickling, and until they do that, I don't really see much we can do. One way to do it might be to use the annoy saving to disk utilities to write/read the annoy index, but that would mean having two files to worry about, which is not great. I agree that if working with large data, it is annoying to have to re-calculate the KNNG every time. I wouldn't be opposed to this workaround, but it feels more like a band-aid than a real solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/770260087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/770261572","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/155#issuecomment-770261572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/155","id":770261572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDI2MTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-30T18:40:30Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T18:40:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Personally,

agree. Until we get this done, I would suggest implementing a custom `Affinity` object, where you can just assign the `P` matrix. The internal scipy sparse matrix is easily picklable, so she can calculate the affinity matrix once, then pickle/load that as needed. That would probably be the easiest way to go.\r\n\r\nI'll be quite busy until March since I have to submit my PhD topic proposal by then, so I don't think this is something that will get fixed that soon.
