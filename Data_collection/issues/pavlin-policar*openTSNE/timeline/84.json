My feeling is that in 3d convergence is easier. In 2d, tSNE with standard optimisation parameters often gets stuck in a bad local minimum where related clusters are separated in different parts of the visualization and cannot \"get through\" to each other. In 3d there is \"more space\" for them to navigate.
