But it's probably worth it.\r\n\r\n> Third, there is a typo in \"Calcualting affinity matrix\". ... Also, you might a separate ===> entry for initialization. At least with spectral it can take some time, but I guess pca on a large dataset can also take some non-negligible time.\r\n\r\nI actually wanted to include exactly this in the spectral commit for both PCA and spectral init methods but forgot to push the commit.
