Your dummy class is actually included [here](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/nearest_neighbors.py#L753-L776), and I think it has already been released (it's been a while since I looked at this).\r\n\r\nIt's a convoluted solution, I know, but currently the only supported one. I need to return to this and think about how I would allow something like the standard `metric=\"precomputed\"` without cluttering the API further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/1263329652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7493819022,"node_id":"LE_lADOCCUuTM5SER5-zwAAAAG-qpqO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/events/7493819022","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-30T09:23:38Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/1263722728","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/214#issuecomment-1263722728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/214","id":1263722728,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCCUuTM5LUuDo","user":{"login":"jlmelville","id":1936393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzYzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1936393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville","html_url":"https://github.com/jlmelville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlmelville/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-30T15:32:17Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T15:32:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh yes looks like I missed the in-built precomputed class.
