I have used scanpy before, although usually not for visualization and it's very nice to work with. This seems like a great use case for openTSNE, exactly as you said, it will take any pre-existing KNN graph. Also, I noticed that in the latest version of scanpy, they introduce `ingest` functionality, which is exactly what I was doing with the t-SNE transform. Currently, `ingest` supports only UMAP, but extending this should be straightforward to enable adding new samples to existing embeddings with openTSNE. I believe this is something that FIt-SNE does not support.\r\n\r\nThe recipes are a good idea, I've thought about including these in openTSNE as well, since I generally go for the multiscale approach whenever I do anything and find myself copy-pasting code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/571988802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/572001577","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102#issuecomment-572001577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/102","id":572001577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjAwMTU3Nw==","user":{"login":"dkobak","id":8970231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzAyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8970231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkobak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkobak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-08T11:06:59Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T11:06:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes!\r\n\r\nDefinitely would be great to have `ingest` for UMAP and `ingest` for tSNE.
