I created a completely new conda environment and installed fastTSNE. I trimmed down your code to the bare minimum and unfortunately, I am unable to replicate your results.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom time import time\r\n\r\nfrom fastTSNE import TSNE\r\nfrom sklearn import manifold, datasets\r\n\r\ndigits = datasets.load_digits(n_class=6)\r\nX, y = digits.data, digits.target\r\n\r\n# sklearn t-SNE embedding of the digits dataset\r\ntsne = manifold.TSNE(n_components=2, init='pca', random_state=0)\r\nt0 = time()\r\nX_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)\r\nprint('scikit-learn: %.2f' % (time() - t0))\r\n\r\n# fast TSNE\r\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, initialization='pca', n_jobs=4)\r\nt0 = time()\r\nembedding = tsne.fit(X)\r\nprint('fasttsne: %.2f' % (time() - t0))\r\n```\r\nand I get the following output\r\n```\r\nscikit-learn: 12.80\r\nfasttsne: 2.00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe exact times are sure to be different since we are running different hardware, but might it be possible that you mixed your numbers up and that it was fastTSNE which ran in 4.5 seconds and sklearn that ran in 24 seconds? The speed-up in my run was 6x, which is the same as the speed-up you observed.\r\n\r\nHonestly, the only other thing that comes to mind that would explain these results is if you were running fastTSNE with the parameter settings meant for large data sets, like this:\r\n```\r\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, initialization='pca', n_jobs=4,\r\n            negative_gradient_method='fft', neighbors='approx')\r\nt0 = time()\r\nembedding = tsne.fit(X)\r\nprint('fasttsne: %.2f' % (time() - t0))\r\n```\r\nwhich results in\r\n```\r\nfasttsne: 58.87\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you run the snippet I provided (it does the same as yours, without the plotting) and paste the output of that and verify that scikit-learn is still faster than fastTSNE? If so, please provide your CPU model, operating system, python, numpy versions which will be useful for debugging this strange behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/431967398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/431976557","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/8#issuecomment-431976557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/8","id":431976557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTk3NjU1Nw==","user":{"login":"omarcr","id":6231285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzEyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6231285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr","html_url":"https://github.com/omarcr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omarcr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-22T20:40:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T20:40:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey

I have access to a windows machine and I will try to replicate this there.\r\n\r\nTwo things stand out to me:\r\n1. conda appears to be installing version 0.2.6, the latest version is 0.2.7 and should be available on conda-forge, so this is strange. In version 0.2.6, the `n_jobs=-1` parameter wasn't working as expected and was likely using a single core. However, in my snippet, I set `n_jobs=4`, which should have worked fine in that version, so this can't be the culprit.\r\n2.

It must have somehow snuck its way into the pip package. In any case, this indicates that you're using an old version of the package (as supported by the first point). If the print statements somehow made it into the package, I'm not sure what else might be there. Maybe I accidentaly included something that hurt performance...\r\n\r\nCould you please make sure you're using the latest version of the package i.e. 0.2.7. I am not sure why conda didn't download that automatically for you... I don't know if this is responsible for the speed issues, but it is a good starting point.\r\n\r\nI'll try to replicate this on Windows and get back to

that. I installed v0.2.6 on my linux machine and got similar results to yours. Apparently, there is something very wrong with v0.2.6. I am farily sure that the git version is fine, but something must have snuck into the pypi package. I'll either remove the version altogether or update the package on pypi. v0.2.7 fixed a couple important bugs, so it might be smarter to remove 0.2.6 altogether. Thank you very much for bringing attention to this.

As of 1.10.2018, conda stopped supporting Python 3.5 ([announcement](https://conda-forge.org/docs/news_announce.html#pinned-announcements)). This means that any conda package was no longer being built for 3.5.\r\n\r\nI had pushed v0.2.7 to conda only a few days ago, so the only available 0.2.7 package is for Python 3.6. Unfortunately, this means that only the broken 0.2.6 package is available for Python 3.5.\r\n\r\n> Using pip assumes a linux environment\r\n\r\nYes, that's why I recommend installing via conda. You can use pip if you have a C compiler available, or you can let conda precompile the packages for you.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the solution is really simple - just update your python version. This can be done easily with conda\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda install python==3.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know what I can do about this, I'll see if I can remove the broken package from conda

again, I've managed to track down the problem and have (hopefully) fixed it.

The speedup is about the same - 6x - for this particular example.\r\n\r\nI'll push a new release onto conda ASAP, so please verify that the issue is actually fixed.
