All the C++ code is generated by cython, so there is actually no C++ code maintained in this repository. Concretely, the Python extensions are written in the Cython language e.g. [openTSNE/_tsne.pyx](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/_tsne.pyx), which automatically get translated into C++, producing [openTSNE/_tsne.cpp](https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/blob/master/openTSNE/_tsne.cpp). When we introduce changes into these .pyx modules, we run it through cython and a new .cpp file is generated.\r\n\r\nIf you're installing openTSNE using pip, and it's downloading the source distribution i.e. non-precompiled binary, then your platform probably isn't supported. OpenBSD 6.8. is relatively new, so there are a few options:\r\n- cython doesn't support this platform,\r\n- pip doesn't know how to properly resolve the wheel, or\r\n- most likely, the last release of openTSNE was built at a time when this platform wasn't yet supported, and the precompiled binaries are unsupported.\r\n\r\nIt's also strange that it's trying to install openTSNE v0.4.4, while the latest version is 0.5.1.\r\n\r\nI think you might be able to fix the problem by installing cython (`pip install cython`), then running the installation process again. If this doesn't work, try cloning the latest release and installing directly from there using `python setup.py install`. You can then delete the cloned directory.\r\n\r\nAlso, please update your issue to include information about your compiler. This may help users experiencing the same problem in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/792523018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/comments/794520976","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/161#issuecomment-794520976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pavlin-policar/openTSNE/issues/161","id":794520976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDUyMDk3Ng==","user":{"login":"pavlin-policar","id":5758119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5758119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlin-policar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlin-policar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T22:07:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T22:07:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing to inactivity.
