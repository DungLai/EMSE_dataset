Dmitry accurately characterized my position; I hesitate to make the implementation inconsistent with Van der Maaten's. Also, since FIt-SNE currently does not include the 4, I think it would become even more confusing if it suddenly changes to have the 4. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would definitely be open to adding a note about this to the documentation. Perhaps the description of the learning rate parameter would be a good place, this way anyone who is looking to change the learning rate will see a note that the implementation does or does not include the constant 4. \r\n\r\n> In any case, it's important for me because in our preprint we follow Belkina et al. in recommending to set learning rate = n/12, but this refers to the Maaten's learning rate (at least I think that that's what Belkina et al. use!). It translates to learning rate = n/48 in scikit and currently in openTSNE... Of course this 1/12 factor is largely arbitrary; it can be that n/3 would work as well.\r\n\r\nI agree. I think the reason that recommendation is helpful is because it makes the learning rate scale with n; I would be surprised if the constant matters a great deal.
