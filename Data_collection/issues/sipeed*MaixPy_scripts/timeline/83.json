i also bought them for this purpose,i did send them a message with no reply yet,\r\ni have since tried it with maix bit with the same pcb and it works with no problems.so im still confused.\r\ni used pins 33 for pitch and pins 19 for roll,grounded the external servo power with the m1n board and thats it,if you happy to risk the test let me know how it goes.\r\n\r\ni would like a schematic but cannot find one i dont think they offer one yet either.\r\ni do believe it will work fine on the maxiduino as ive seen someone else runnning it with that board but not the m1n.\r\n\r\nlet me know if you get it working on the m1n as i like these
