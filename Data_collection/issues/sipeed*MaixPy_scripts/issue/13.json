I'm running minicom on Linux Mint connected to /dev/ttyACM0 at 115200 with hardware and software flow control set to OFF, and the backspace key set to DEL, and Line wrap set to YES. I've tried the USB cable that came with the MaixPy and one of my own USB cables. I also tried using gtkterm instead of minicom. They all do the same thing: I get the MaixPy greeting screen and the MicroPython >>> prompt, but when I hit Enter or Ctrl-C or any other key nothing happens. \r\n\r\nHere's what minicom looks like when I connect: \r\n\r\nWelcome to minicom 2.7.1 \r\n\r\nOPTIONS: I18n \r\nCompiled on Aug 13 2017, 15:25:34. \r\nPort /dev/ttyACM0, 20:57:40 \r\n\r\nPress CTRL-A Z for help on special keys\r\n\r\n__      __                      _____ __      __  ___    __          __ \r\n|   \\   \\/     |        /\\         |_     _|  \\   \\   /   /  |  _   \\   \\   \\       /  / \r\n|    \\    /    |      /     \\          |   |      \\  V   /   | |__)  |   \\   \\_/  / \r\n|    | \\/      |    /    /\\   \\        |   |       > <      | ___/       \\      / \r\n|    |    |    |   /   __     \\    _|   |_     /  .   \\   |  |              |  | \r\n| _ |    | _ | /_ /        \\ _\\ |_____| /_ /  \\ _\\ |_|              |_| \r\nOfficial Site:http://www.sipeed.com/ \r\nWiki:http://maixpy.sipeed.com/ \r\n[MAIXPY]Pll0:freq:320666666 \r\n[MAIXPY]Pll1:freq:159714285 \r\n[MAIXPY]Flash:0xc8:0x17 \r\n[MAIXPY]:Spiffs Mount successful \r\n[MAIXPY]LCD:init \r\n\r\nMicroPython 3b5c45649-dirty on 2018-11-15; Sipeed_M1 with kendryte-k210 \r\nType \"help()\" for more information. \r\n>>> \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCTRL-A Z for help | 115200 8N1 | NOR | Minicom 2.7.1 | VT102 | Offline | ttyACM0 \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny idea how to fix this?
