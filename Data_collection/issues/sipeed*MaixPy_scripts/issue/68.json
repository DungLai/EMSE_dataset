I've tried the function `audio = rx.wait_record()` to try and stop recording so that I can send the image to the model but the problem persists.\r\nI'm using the MaixPy Dock board, I also tried with the Maixpy Go and the most recent firmware versions\r\nWhen I run the script on the terminal after transfering it to the board returns this error message:\r\n“W (129088164430) SYSCALL: sys_exit called by core 0 with 0x1”\r\n\r\nPlease any help is appreciated I'm on a time schedule to deliver the project","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sipeed/MaixPy_scripts/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sipeed/MaixPy_scripts/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
