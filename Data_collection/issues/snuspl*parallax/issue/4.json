It leads to the incomplete convergence of the model.\r\nFurthermore, the fact that it is the user's responsibility to specify which variable should be replicated(GLOBAL_VARIABLE) and which should not (LOCAL_VARIABLE) also seems to be a problem, since parallax aims to support 'automatic parallelization'.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\nUsers have to distinguish between local and global variables by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nParallax automatically detects a local variable or helps a user with a warning \r\n\r\n### Failure Information (for bugs)\r\n\r\n#### Failure Logs\r\n\r\n#### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/snuspl/parallax/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/snuspl/parallax/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
