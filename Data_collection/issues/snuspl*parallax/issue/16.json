Seems really nice. I have a question (please note I'm new to TensorFlow)\r\n\r\nI have N machines, each with one GPU, M Gigabytes of disk storage and J Gigabytes of memory, and my training dataset is accessible to all machines. How do I configure things so that when training in async data parallel mode (PS option) I can make sure only M and J Gigabytes are used per machine? So I can avoid any memory errors. \r\n\r\nCould you setup a Google Groups for this project so we may ask these kinds of questions there?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"idibidiart","id":1288823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODg4MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1288823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart","html_url":"https://github.com/idibidiart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/snuspl/parallax/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/snuspl/parallax/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
