Keras Functional model construction only supports TF API calls that *do* support dispatching, such as `tf.math.add` or `tf.reshape`. Other APIs cannot be called directly on symbolic Kerasinputs/outputs. You can work around this limitation by putting the operation in a custom Keras layer `call` and calling that layer on this symbolic input/output.\r\n\r\nCall arguments received:\r\n  • step_function=<function AttentionLayer.call.<locals>.energy_step at 0x7f1d5ff279e0>\r\n  • inputs=tf.Tensor(shape=(None, None, 256), dtype=float32)\r\n  • initial_states=['tf.Tensor(shape=(None, 101), dtype=float32)']\r\n  • go_backwards=False\r\n  • mask=None\r\n  • constants=None\r\n  • unroll=False\r\n  • input_length=None\r\n  • time_major=False\r\n  • zero_output_for_mask=False\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I overcome this error?
