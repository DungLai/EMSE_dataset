Then I created the attention layer in the way that is shown in the README: `attn_layer = AttentionLayer(name='attention_layer');`.\r\n\r\nThe code for creating my model is:\r\n```model = Sequential();\r\n    embedding_layer = set_up_embedding_layer(word_idx_training, em_dim, maximum_sequence_length, embedding_type);\r\n    model.add(embedding_layer);\r\n    attn_layer = AttentionLayer(name='attention_layer');\r\n    model.add(attn_layer);\r\n    model.add(LSTM(16));\r\n    model.add(Dense(int(class_number), activation='softmax'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run the script, I am getting an error message that the attention layer is not of class `Layer`. I understand that the layer is intended to work with GRUs, but nonetheless it looks like your class `AttentionLayer` is of type `Layer`. Is this correct? And, can I use the attention mechanism as I show above, or only by concatanating the attention input and the decoder GRU output?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"thushv89","id":1381369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODEzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89","html_url":"https://github.com/thushv89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
