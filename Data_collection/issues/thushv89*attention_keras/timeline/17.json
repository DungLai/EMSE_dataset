Is this correct\r\n\r\nYes, that's correct.\r\n\r\n> And, can I use the attention mechanism as I show above, or only by concatanating the attention input and the decoder GRU output?\r\n\r\nSo, I am not completely sure if you can use this layer as you've shown. Initially, I only thought about using this with sequential models. If you can provide more details (may be a diagram of what you're trying to create, I might be able to help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/comments/564301056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thushv89","id":1381369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODEzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89","html_url":"https://github.com/thushv89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2872394821,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg3MjM5NDgyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/events/2872394821","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-10T23:08:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2872394824,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NzIzOTQ4MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/events/2872394824","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-10T23:08:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/comments/564784983","html_url":"https://github.com/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/17#issuecomment-564784983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thushv89/attention_keras/issues/17","id":564784983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDc4NDk4Mw==","user":{"login":"thushv89","id":1381369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODEzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89","html_url":"https://github.com/thushv89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thushv89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T23:50:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T23:50:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"If
