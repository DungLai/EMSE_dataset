I have downloaded the pretrained weights of yolo3 (from link in readme) and I am trying to test detection on random image form internet. \r\nI am using python 3.5.6 with all libs installed according to the requirements.txt (linux with cuda 10.0 installed)\r\n\r\nI am using this command to run: python yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all.py -w yolov3.weights -i 00001.jpg\r\nBut the code encountered problem in the decode_netout() function while calculating x, y, w, h. In the operation -> np.exp(h) code returns inf (ex: np.exp(405)).  Because it reaches max float32 value. \r\nHave any one else encountered this problem?
