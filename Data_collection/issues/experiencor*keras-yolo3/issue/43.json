I think the model detected some objects but cannot figure out they are not what i want. this derive a high recall but low precision. what can i do with this except level-up the threshold? Does this have a relation with the classification loss changing from softmax to cross-entropy? \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
