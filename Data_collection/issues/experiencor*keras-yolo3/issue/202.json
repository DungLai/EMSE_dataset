How close should the annotation bounding boxes to the original object in the image. Right now, I am using bounding boxes leaving a couple of pixels around the perimeter. \r\n\r\n2. There are almost half of the objects that are not predicted as objects. How to minimize the false negatives? Any suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n3.
