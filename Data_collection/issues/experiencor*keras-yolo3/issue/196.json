My issue is I don't really know what is going on. In particular, I don't know what `min_input_size`, `max_input_size `and `anchors ` does. I saw this answer for the latter:\r\n\r\n> They define the range to vary the size of the image during training. Should be a multiple of 32.\r\n\r\nBut what that doesn't actually mean much to me. How am I supposed to know how much I want my input image to vary by? And why is not in terms of width and height? If I have an image that is 320x240, do I set min/max to 240/320? Or a multiple of that?\r\n\r\nWhat are anchors and why are they important?\r\n\r\nIf there's a document which explains this I'd be very grateful.\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
