However, these are numpy arrays. To get a single value, do you average them all out? I tried averaging them, but then I got a low precision value (0.2) which is confusing since my mAP is 0.65. However, recall seems to be very high at 0.75. It is strange since with other yolov3 implementations the \"recall\" and \"precision\" doesn't vary by this much.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
