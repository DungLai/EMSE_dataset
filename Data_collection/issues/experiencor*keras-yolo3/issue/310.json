What is the difference between train_times and epoch? Also, in config.json, there is a parameter callled \"\"grid_scales\", and the default is [1, 1, 1]. I'm assuming this is related to how yolov3 has three detection layers? If I wanted it to have 4 detection layers, would I set it to [1, 1, 1, 1] and also manually add in a fourth detection layer in the model?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
