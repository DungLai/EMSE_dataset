Today I finally compared it with the inference result using darknet, and it confirms that darknet doesn't have this issue.\r\nI double checked that I was using the same yolo3.weights, which was trained from COCO dataset\r\n\r\nI guess it's due to image resize or post processing issues. Any idea how to fix it?\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nInference from this Keras version ( notice the guy in black code in the middle and on the right hand side)\r\n![keras-version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24217337/87474776-468e3c80-c5e9-11ea-9e93-6816ca0662f5.jpg)\r\nInference from this Darknet version\r\n![darknet-version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24217337/87474787-4a21c380-c5e9-11ea-93a8-bb877d4e804a.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
