To do this I need to change the loss in such a way that the prediction is only compared with the annotation bounding box that has the highest iou of all 3. However when I look at your loss function i am not sure what I need to change to do this...\r\n\r\nCan you give me some help with this or do you not have the time?\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\n\r\nJasper","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
