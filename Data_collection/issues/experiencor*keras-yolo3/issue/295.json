However, I also want to include images of healthy vessels, with no bounding boxes, so that the model doesn't simply become a general vessel detector.  I included these images along with label data in json format that just has an empty dictionary where the box coordinates would normally be, but when I tried training I got a loss of infinite and it didn't train.  Has anyone had success including images with no boxes as negatives in a yolo-v3 training dataset?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
