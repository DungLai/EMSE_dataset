The class indices predicted by the model will correspond to the original order of the labels, so can't be compared to the indices of the sorted labels.\r\n\r\nI'm working with some COCO images and the APs are coming out as mostly 0s. However, if I remove the command to sort the labels, the AP calculation seems to work ok.\r\n\r\nWhat's confusing me is that this seems to be such a major bug that I can't understand how it wouldn't have been spotted before. Can anyone tell me if I'm missing something?
