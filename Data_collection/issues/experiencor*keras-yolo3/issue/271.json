The batch size of 16 seemed to be too much for the 1080ti which has 11GB of VRAM. I also got this error with a batch size of 10.\r\nFinally, I changed the batch size to 4. After this, I no longer get an OOM error.\r\nUsing the train.py with a the modified config file, I get some tensorflow output which seems to indicate training is starting as normal. However, the program starts to output \"resizing: \" and doesn't seem to progress in epochs. I have left it training for over 2 hours and all I've seen so far is hundreds of lines of resizing operations.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36770076/81433211-7c83f000-9164-11ea-8cfe-392e9421f353.png)\r\n\r\nIs this to be expected? Should the model be trained eventually? How long should training take for 33k 110x60 images on a 1080ti? Could I reduce the training set to solve this problem and still have a decent model?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"LouisMach","id":36770076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzcwMDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36770076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach","html_url":"https://github.com/LouisMach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
