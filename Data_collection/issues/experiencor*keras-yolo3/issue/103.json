In the `create_callbacks` function, the callbacks monitor `loss`, i.e., they do their respective action when the loss is getting smaller. However, the actual loss of the model is the `dummy_loss` which does not really tell you much about the performance of the model. Or did I get something wrong? Do the callbacks still make sense in that setting?
