If yes, is it compatible with my original size 6000px*4000px ?\r\n- Is there a relation between anchors and min_input_size and max_input_size ?\r\n- Do i need to increase min_input_size and max_input_size ?\r\n- Why my loss not decreasing more ?\r\n- Is it possible to print val_loss ? And is it a good thing to print it ? If no, when to stop training with only loss ?\r\n- What do you suggest more ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance !\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
