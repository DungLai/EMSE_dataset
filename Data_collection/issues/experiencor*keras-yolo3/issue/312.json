However, modifying the shapes of some variables can be a little confusing. One in particular is true_boxes on line 236 in yolo.py.\r\n`true_boxes  = Input(shape=(1, 1, 1, max_box_per_image, 4))`\r\nThere was a very recent issue that was posted a few days ago about grid scales, and from what I understand changing it from [1, 1, 1] to [1, 1, 1, 1] would mean there would be four grids, which is helpful for my problem. Similarly, what is the intuition behind  shape=(1, 1, 1, ...)? Are there 3 1's because there are three detection layers? Are there any other variables I should be considering? The assumption in yolov3 is that there are three detection layers so it there are default numbers, so there ussually isn't any comments about it.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
