Because of this, it takes a lot of processing time for decoding bounding boxes because they don't get eliminated at the first step. \r\n\r\nI think it should be something like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37745467/87256274-c5745f80-c499-11ea-8590-e3e94d216031.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
