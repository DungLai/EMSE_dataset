But I am so confused about the object scale applied to the object loss. I read the source file from the darknet repo, and I found that there is no scale to apply to the object loss, so I did the same thing in my code, which did not work well that the confidence is too small to pass the threshold. \r\n  And I find that you set the object scale to 5.0 in your [configuration](https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3/blob/25af1ba9f054aacff2f778618116629cc0c370df/config.json#L23). Did you meet the same trouble? or you just want to keep the configuration same to the yolo2? \r\n  I am so stuck in the loss problem of yolo3. And thank you for your implementation job of yolo2 and yolo3 in keras.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"WXDawaken","id":12083970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgzOTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12083970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken","html_url":"https://github.com/WXDawaken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WXDawaken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
