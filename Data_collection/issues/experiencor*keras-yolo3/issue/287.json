I was looking around, and a lot of the other tools I found were a pain to set up, and this was easy in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe yolo3-one-file-to-detect-them-all looks good, but I propose a few changes to make this more useful as a library. For example, you could split the model loading and the detection methods. I've put my changes as a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/benman1/51b2e4b10365333f0af34f4839f86f27).\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
