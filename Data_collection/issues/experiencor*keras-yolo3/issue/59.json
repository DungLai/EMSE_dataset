One other question: What is the (varying) size of the grid used in `yolo.py`? During initialization, the cells are created with \r\n```\r\ncell_x = tf.to_float(tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.range(max_grid_w), [max_grid_h]), (1, max_grid_h, max_grid_w, 1, 1)))\r\ncell_y = tf.transpose(cell_x, (0,2,1,3,4))\r\nself.cell_grid = tf.tile(tf.concat([cell_x,cell_y],-1), [batch_size, 1, 1, 3, 1])\r\n```\r\nHow das `tf.tile` work in this setting? As I understood the code, the resulting grid really has size `[max_input_size, max_input_size]`, which would be quite large. Or is the image downsampled before and then the grid is applied?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"RichardSieg","id":13641877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13641877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardSieg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
