I generated anchors before training, and modified min_input_size„ÄÅmax_input_size. I didn't modified another thing, but the detection results performed not so well, some cars can not be detected. \r\nI didn't understand how the parameters [grid_scales, obj_scale, noobj_scale, xywh_scale, class_scale] worked, should I modify them according to my own dataset?\r\nThank you for your help in advance.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
