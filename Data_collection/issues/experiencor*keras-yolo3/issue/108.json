I suggest that you modify the ```predict.py``` to let it adapt to windows machine. I had a small issue to let it output the predicted and tagged image, and realized it was just some path problem.\r\n\r\nIn the main loop, you may want to change the saving function to this below:\r\n```\r\n# the main loop\r\nfor image_path in image_paths:\r\n    _, tail = os.path.split(image_path)\r\n    # do the work....\r\n    cv2.imwrite(os.path.join(output_path, tail), np.uint8(image))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this should work on unix systems, too. Thanks again for this delightful framework!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/108/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
