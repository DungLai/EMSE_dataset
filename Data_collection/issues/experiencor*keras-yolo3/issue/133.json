But when i try to run it on multiple nodes (with 2gpus on each node), the code is still detecting only one node with 2 gpus. Any idea, how do i make it run on each node's gpus?\r\n\r\nTo run on multiple gpus i have done  only this stupid thing in the config file:\r\nsince 2 nodes * 2 gpus per node  =4 gpus.\r\nSo in the config.json file i have:\r\n\r\n\"gpus\":                 \"0,1,2,3\",\r\n\r\nIts only detecting the 0 & 1 (first node) correctly and works well but not detecting 2 & 3 i.e the second node.
