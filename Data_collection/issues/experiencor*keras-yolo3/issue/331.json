The second issue is that the train in completed and the wieghts.h5 file is generated. However, in the end of the train, the mAP equals 0. I found it to be a little bit strange, so i ran the predict.py to confirm if the weights.h5 file was correctly generated, but it does no work, it gives me the same error showed in 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with this issue?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
