I used this model to train a plate classifier and, by far, this code is the one that gave me the best results yet. But there is one simple problem. The code runs way TOO slow without a GPU compared to other solutions (like cascade for example). I even tried using tiny-yolo3, but it did not give me a good speed.\r\nDo you guys have any idea how could I improve the speed of the code on CPU?\r\nMy first thought was about transforming it to tensorflow and compiling it with bazel; However, I cannot do that because all compilers found on internet asks for the architecture file. How could I obtain this file, and do you guys have any other ideas to improve this code speed (even if it means to lose a little of accuracy ) ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/128/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
