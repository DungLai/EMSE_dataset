Thanks a lot that I successfully trained on my own data using your code.\r\nYet I found some bugs in predict.py:\r\nLine 109:  image_paths = [inp_file for inp_file in image_paths if (inp_file[-4:] == '.jpg' or **inp_file == '.png')**]\r\nThe 'inp_file' should be 'inp_file[-4:]'\r\nAnd because it didn't include '.JPEG' files, it confused me for a while when I tested on my data which are all .JPEG images (with no outputs), so I changed this line as:\r\nimage_paths = [inp_file for inp_file in image_paths if (inp_file[-4:] in ['.jpg', '.png', 'JPEG'])]\r\n\r\nStill, I got a warning saying: 'warnings.warn('No training configuration found in save file: '\r\nI don't know why but it does not matter.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"experiencor","id":5645503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDU1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5645503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor","html_url":"https://github.com/experiencor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/experiencor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
