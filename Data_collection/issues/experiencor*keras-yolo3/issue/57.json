Thanks for this (also excellent) implementation of YOLOv3. One question about the order of anchors: In all your config files, the order of the anchors is *increasing* (by width). Nevertheless, in the `yolo3_one_ file..`, the anchors are in *decreasing* order. Furthermore, it seems that for the first YOLO layer (`loss_yolo_1`) the last three anchors are used and as I understood it, this layer is responsible for the small scale. Is there a mistake in my understanding or a small bug?","closed_by":{"login":"RichardSieg","id":13641877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13641877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardSieg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSieg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
