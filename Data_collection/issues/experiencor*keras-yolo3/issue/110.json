Obviously the fact is to use real test data to evaluate the performance, but is there a way to tell if this training loss = 10 is a \"good\" one? Or does it indicate I need to use more training data to see if I can push it down to 5 or even less?\r\n\r\nUltimately my question is, for a well-known model with a pre-defined loss function, is there a \"good\" standard value for the training loss?\r\n\r\nthanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/110/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
