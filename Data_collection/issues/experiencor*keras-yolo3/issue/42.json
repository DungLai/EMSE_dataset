I have a few questions related to this. \r\n\r\n1) Do you want the losses to be roughly equal per output head and if so is it fine to adjust the grid_scale accordingly ( ie [1, .5, .25])\r\n\r\n2) What do you find is a good loss now for a model? It used to be that I knew I had a good yolov2 model when the loss was < 0.1. Now I am getting losses around ~20. Possible there are other issues at play here and I have made a mistake somewhere. I am not using your code as is, but instead incorporating the new loss in my own code.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
