I cannot understand why `true_boxes` need to be passed into YoloLayer. \r\n`conf_delta *= tf.expand_dims(tf.to_float(best_ious < self.ignore_thresh), 4)`\r\nthis line filter out some elements which match `true_boxes`, but how it effect the loss, \r\n`conf_delta = object_mask * (pred_box_conf - true_box_conf) * self.obj_scale + (1 - object_mask) * conf_delta * self.noobj_scale`\r\n\r\n2. why normalizing of loss missed in yolo3. not same with yolo2.\r\n`loss_xy = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(xy_delta), list(range(1, 5)))`\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
