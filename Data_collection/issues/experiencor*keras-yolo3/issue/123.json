I understannd `dummy loss` is just sth fake as we want to use `model.compile`. But where did we call the `call` function to compute the real yolov3 loss?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"jianing-sun","id":33068301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY4MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33068301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun","html_url":"https://github.com/jianing-sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianing-sun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
