To configure it nicely, you also have to understand the YOLO v3 architecture. Below are some questions and some ideas on how to optimize (without me knowing your data)\r\n\r\nGrid scales:\r\nAre your images really 32x32? Are the numbers like 1x1, 5x5, 10x10 (These are just random sizes)?\r\n\r\nYou have to understand the 3 scales that YOLO work on. The first scale being 32 times smaller than the input. So if your images are 32x32,\r\n- First scale, prediction on 1x1 feature maps.\r\n- Second scale, prediction on 2x2 feature maps.\r\n- Third scale, prediction on 4x4 feature maps.\r\n\r\nI'm actually curious as to what your generated anchors are like, because it probably will look like  mostly 0s imo lol. I certainly hope not. If there are 0s, it means that those anchors are useless.\r\n\r\nTo modify this, you should look at which scale are you most dependent on. If they're all equal, you value all 3 scales the same. If you increase the scale, you value that particular scale more and its loss will be higher making the model try to optimize the weights for that.\r\n\r\nI'm using [3,2,1] personally. My images are 256x256 and I have plenty of small objects but some medium sized and occasionally large ones.\r\n\r\nObject scale:\r\nAre you getting lots of false positives? If so, you might want to increase this, otherwise keep it at 1.\r\n\r\nI have this at 3.\r\n\r\nNo object scale:\r\nAre you getting lots of false negatives? If so, you might want to increase this, otherwise keep it at 1.\r\n\r\nI have this at 1.\r\n\r\nX, Y, width, height scale:\r\nAre your predictions not centered and smaller or larger than what they should be? If so, you might want to increase this, otherwise keep it at 1.\r\nGive the predictions some leeway though (Do manual visual checks), as we can't expect 100%.\r\n\r\nI have this at 3.\r\n\r\nClass scale:\r\nAre the prediction boxes correct but having a lower classification score and resulting in a wrong classification? If so, you might want to increase this, otherwise keep it at 1.\r\n\r\nI have this at 1, but I am applying this on a single class. As such, it does not matter what this number is for me.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf your images can't get larger (I'm assuming these are the best images (32x32) you have and not scaled down to increase training time etc), YOLO v3 would not be great for you.\r\n\r\nYou can make changes to the architecture, like reducing the scaling from 32 times to say 8 times. This however requires you to understand the architecture, remove bits etc (Much easier than adding another scale,  and that was a pain in my ass and didn't work well for me). \r\n\r\nI hope this helps you!

Here (with Yolov3) I need more time to see the training results. \r\n\r\nOther topics will depend os this output, but I really appreciated your advices. \r\n\r\nAbout the architecture, I am definitely not going to change it. I will follow your advice and work changing the dataset and parameters.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n👍  :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

welcome @giovannicaprio.\r\n\r\nYour anchors should be regenerated on the scaled down images & annotations. The anchors that are used do not get rescaled. It's not going to prevent the network from training properly but it'd be a little slower. But I'd recommend you use the original images just because you lose a lot of spatial information when you scale a image down.\r\n\r\nYes, you are right. The first scale is the largest, followed by medium and small objects.\r\nOne way to find out which scale is most important, you can take a look at this part in the generator.py, method __getitem__\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor i in range(len(self.anchors)):\r\n    anchor = self.anchors[i]\r\n    iou    = bbox_iou(shifted_box, anchor)\r\n\r\n    if max_iou < iou:\r\n        max_anchor = anchor\r\n        max_index  = i\r\n        max_iou    = iou\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can include a counter to count the number of times a anchor is used and determine from there which is your most important to least important anchor. From that, you can see which scales should have higher weighting.\r\n\r\nGood luck with training on your dataset
