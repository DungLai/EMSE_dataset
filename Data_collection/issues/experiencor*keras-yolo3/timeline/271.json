from what I've found so far, it's expected. There's just a lot of resizing between epochs, and training takes longer than expected for me. I ended up training with a smaller dataset, 1200 pictures instead of 33000. So far results could be better, so I might try increasing the dataset again.\r\n\r\nI timed the resizing operation to see how much time was being taken by resizing, but it's a miniscule amount of time per operation. According to perfcounter it's about 1.1000000057492798e-06 seconds. Resizing happens every 10 batches so for my dataset of 30k pictures with a batch size of 8 and 100 epochs, that means 37 500 resizes which takes 0.04 seconds in total. Unfortunately, training seems to take a long time even on the 1080ti regardless of resizing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/626993643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LouisMach","id":36770076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzcwMDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36770076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach","html_url":"https://github.com/LouisMach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LouisMach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3324984185,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMyNDk4NDE4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/events/3324984185","actor":{"login":"zmlim","id":37165086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTY1MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37165086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim","html_url":"https://github.com/zmlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T22:13:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3324984186,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMjQ5ODQxODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/events/3324984186","actor":{"login":"zmlim","id":37165086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTY1MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37165086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim","html_url":"https://github.com/zmlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T22:13:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/627243722","html_url":"https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/271#issuecomment-627243722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/271","id":627243722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzI0MzcyMg==","user":{"login":"zmlim","id":37165086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTY1MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37165086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim","html_url":"https://github.com/zmlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T10:05:01Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T10:05:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi @Flozker thank you for the timely reply!
