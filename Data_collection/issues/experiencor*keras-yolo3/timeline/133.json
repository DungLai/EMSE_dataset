I have access to similar HPC (with 2 gpus on each node), so to make my CNN run on 4 gpus, I have to specify number of nodes=2. in my resources request And it does detect all the 4 gpus. But my problem is that Keas outputs two different outcomes (losses) from two different nodes separately. Any idea how to merge them?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/451426113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"khelina","id":17193930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTkzOTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17193930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina","html_url":"https://github.com/khelina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khelina/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
