been using this repo on my own dataset and I have encountered the problem with the loss suddenly hitting nan, even though it was converging nicely before (as in #198  )\r\nAfter printing some things in the tensorflow graph I'm quite sure the error comes from weird values on box width and height, but I haven't managed to pinpoint it.\r\n\r\nTo check it I thought I'd try running the program eagerly with `tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()` but it results in the error `'get_session' is not available when TensorFlow is executing eagerly.`\r\n\r\nIs it either possible to run it eagerly in some way or has anyone figured out the reason for the sudden
