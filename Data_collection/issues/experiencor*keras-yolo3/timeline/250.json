Since this error does not always occur but just with a certain set of weights after training, I am assuming that the prediction in these cases is not a rectangle, but a line. I.e. with a length of 0 in one of the dimensions. What follows from this assumption is, that the area of both the intersection and the union has to be 0 as well. And since this a very bad prediction it would be most appropriate to return an IoU of 0.\r\n\r\nI printed out intersect and union for the error case and in my instance intersect and union turned out to be 0 at the same time. Hence I think it would make sense to do this check right affter calculating the intersect like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nintersect = intersect_w * intersect_h\r\nif intersect==0\r\n    return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we just divide the intersect and 0 divided by any real number is 0. except for the case of 0 divided by 0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/774681551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"459below","id":11325631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI1NjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11325631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below","html_url":"https://github.com/459below","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/459below/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
