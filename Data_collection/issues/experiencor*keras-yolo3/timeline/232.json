I just uninstalled openCV 4.0.0 and installed again in version 3.4.1, then it worked well. Maybe there is something wrong with version 4.0.0 because it is alpha version yet. But I don't know exactly the reason why it didn't work. Anyway, I appreciate to your kindness :) \"\r\n\r\nSo My solutions was to convert all bmp files to jpg files then do training!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/568884472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SteveIb","id":24913534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTEzNTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24913534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb","html_url":"https://github.com/SteveIb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveIb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
