So what I guess above seems right, but I then have a question, the 2nd and the 3rd one actually is the grid id right? Then why the 5th channel should be absolute (center-x, center-y, w, h) but not use (x-offset, y-offset, w, h) instead?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it possible that, for example, I got 13*13 grid from a 416*416 image and then in the grid cell (3,3) I finally got a detection box which far away from grid cell (3,3), like near the grid cell (12, 12)? If so, why should we set a fix grid cell to train the model?\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nOn Jan 28, 2019, at 01:17, YangYun <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfused too.
