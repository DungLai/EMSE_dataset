If yes, is it compatible with my original size 6000px*4000px ?\r\n- I think you have a problem because the YOLO reshape your images to go through the network\r\n- \"min_input_size\":       288,      \r\n- \"max_input_size\":       448,\r\n\r\nIs there a relation between anchors and min_input_size and max_input_size ?\r\n- If you use gen_anchors.py to create anchors you do not have a problem, but, in my Fork, I change gen_acnhors.py to verify validations dataset (https://github.com/kabrau/keras-yolo3).\r\n\r\nDo I need to increase min_input_size and max_input_size ?\r\n- Yes\r\n\r\nWhy my loss not decreasing more ? \r\n- Depends, there are many aspects, bad annotations, meaningless dataset, I do not understand what is your features (2 classes to detect in my dataset, A with 4500 features and B with 1900 features),  for example, the classes are CAT or DOG, but you do not need features, the YOLO will create the features.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to print val_loss ? And is it a good thing to print it ? If no, when to stop training with only loss ?\r\n- Yes, I prefer to use validation dataset too, you need to change the fit_generator and add validations parameters. If you will have problems, send me a message.\r\n\r\nWhat do you suggest more ? \r\n- Show me one sample, maybe a can help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/496770228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kabrau","id":2559616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2559616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau","html_url":"https://github.com/kabrau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabrau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/533882079","html_url":"https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/182#issuecomment-533882079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/182","id":533882079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzg4MjA3OQ==","user":{"login":"sabrinatuli","id":11704586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzA0NTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11704586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli","html_url":"https://github.com/sabrinatuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabrinatuli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-22T13:30:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-22T13:30:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How can I compute min_input_size and max_input_size for my dataset?
