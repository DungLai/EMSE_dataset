hor_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @AntoineHoe \r\nJust to elaborate a little on what experiencor has said:\r\n\r\nDuring training, the input image size is varied randomly between the values of min_input_size and max_input_size in the config file. See _get_net_size() in generator.py for the code that does this. This means that the trained model should be able to successfully detect objects for images in this size range.\r\n\r\nThe input image size used during inference is hardcoded in predict.py on line 26. If you want to change this you could alter the hardcoded value or add a new field to the config file and modify the code to use this value.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/658031693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sharon507","id":62015852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDE1ODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62015852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507","html_url":"https://github.com/Sharon507","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sharon507/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3542952902,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU0Mjk1MjkwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/events/3542952902","actor":{"login":"NoxTheXelor","id":26748640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzQ4NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26748640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor","html_url":"https://github.com/NoxTheXelor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-14T07:56:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3542952909,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1NDI5NTI5MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/events/3542952909","actor":{"login":"NoxTheXelor","id":26748640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzQ4NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26748640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor","html_url":"https://github.com/NoxTheXelor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoxTheXelor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-14T07:56:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
