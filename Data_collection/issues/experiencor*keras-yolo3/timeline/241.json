A keras implementation of YOLOv3 using which you can train and run inference on a custom dataset. This uses keras weights (.h5) to save the model. This part uses the `config.json` as an input of parameters. The files associated with this implementation are `train.py` and `predict.py`.\r\n2. The other implementation of YOLOv3 here uses keras to build and predict the architecture but loads the weights from the native `yolov3.weights`, which in other words, is the darknet weights in darknet format. The file associated with this is: `yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all.py`. This can only be used to run a demo inference on a given image and cannot be used to train using the code available in this repo. \r\n\r\nWith that background information, coming back to your doubt, the author of this repo has already provided with the keras version of the default yolov3.weights - \"backend.h5\" and the same can be downloaded [HERE](https://bit.ly/39rLNoE). \r\n\r\nIf you do not specify any existing pre-trained keras weights (.h5) in the config.json, the program is designed to automatically use the coco-trained default \"backend.h5\" weights during the start of the training. Hence, even though the initial few layers are not frozen, the weight initialization is done using the default yolov3.weights.\r\n\r\nIf you want to strictly use transfer learning, you may modify the code to freeze the first few CNN layers. The architecture is defined in the [yolo.py](https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3/blob/master/yolo.py) file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/experiencor/keras-yolo3/issues/comments/583768909/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"animikhaich","id":16799596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzk5NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16799596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich","html_url":"https://github.com/animikhaich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animikhaich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
