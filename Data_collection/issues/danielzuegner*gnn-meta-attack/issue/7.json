What do you think of this?\r\n\r\nWhen using a surrogate model, we don't have any parameters about the target model. In this case, can't it be counted as a black-box attack? Perhaps it is because of the use of complete datasets, such as training labels.\r\n\r\nI'm confused that the definition of grey-box and black-box, in the field of graph adversarial. \r\n\r\nI will appreciate if you could share your thoughts with me.","closed_by":{"login":"Lexton123","id":55282743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjgyNzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55282743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123","html_url":"https://github.com/Lexton123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
