In other words, I want to greedily pick the perturbation e = (u,v) with the lowest score one at a time, that still has a negative impact on the overall accuracy\r\n\r\nIn the code, is it enough to use the index of the smallest positive number from `adjacency_meta_grad` instead of `adj_meta_grad_argmax = tf.argmax(self.adjacency_meta_grad)`?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
