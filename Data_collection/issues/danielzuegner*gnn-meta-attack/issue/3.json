So on citeseer dataset, with 5% perturbations, the performance of GCN model only drop 1-2%, not 6% as in the paper.\r\n\r\nI don't know what is wrong, and I am wondering if there are some more parameters of the attacker I need to tune.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if you could help me with this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"HappierTreeFriend","id":54655716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjU1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54655716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend","html_url":"https://github.com/HappierTreeFriend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
