I don't think there's a formal definition of black vs. grey-box, and the fact that we're doing poisoning further complicates the picture. I would say that, since we match the architecture of the surrogate model quite closely to the target model (message-passing, two layers), it could be fair to call it a grey-box attack. Moreover, as you mention, we assume that we know the training labels & training data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/comments/1317716825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/comments/1318381654","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/7#issuecomment-1318381654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/7","id":1318381654,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCipWa85OlOhW","user":{"login":"Lexton123","id":55282743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjgyNzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55282743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123","html_url":"https://github.com/Lexton123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lexton123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T10:00:35Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T10:00:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for your reply.
