I've investigated what might be going on. I think most of it boils down to the fact that `pygcn` does things slightly different than we (and sometimes the GCN paper; see my last point) do. \r\n\r\nThe difference in the 'clean' accuracy seem to be due to the fact that we do not perform feature normalization. When I turn off feature normalization the performance of `pygcn` is pretty close to what we get. \r\n\r\nI believe the difference in the reduction of performance through the attack is due to `pygcn` using L2 regularization, which we do use not during our attack. After quickly hacking in a change to [line 529](https://github.com/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/blob/ca690f64329e9b75608bab1fc4045742926bfa07/metattack/meta_gradient_attack.py#L529) of `meta_gradient_attack.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nloss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_node) + 5e-4* (tf.nn.l2_loss(current_weights[0]) + \\\r\n    tf.nn.l2_loss(current_weights[1]) + tf.nn.l2_loss(current_biases[0]) + \\\r\n    tf.nn.l2_loss(current_biases[1]))\r\n```\r\nthe performance of `pygcn` dropped by roughly 5 points, similar to our paper. Of course we have to make sure to use the same split that was used during the attack. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `pygcn` implementation appears to perform a different normalization of the adjacency matrix than was proposed in the original GCN paper. That is, instead of normalizing using `D_tilde^(-1/2) A_tilde D_tilde^(-1/2)` (Eq. (2) in the paper) they use `D_tilde^(-1) A_tilde`.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarification helps -- please let me know if you have any further questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/comments/526079083/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danielzuegner","id":22178797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc4Nzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22178797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzuegner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/comments/526449044","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/3#issuecomment-526449044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielzuegner/gnn-meta-attack/issues/3","id":526449044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjQ0OTA0NA==","user":{"login":"HappierTreeFriend","id":54655716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjU1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54655716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend","html_url":"https://github.com/HappierTreeFriend","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HappierTreeFriend/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T04:15:51Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T04:24:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks so much for your instant reply!!!\r\n\r\nFollowing you advice, now I get similar results on citeseer and cora_ml dataset!\r\n\r\nBut I still cannot reproduce the results on Polblogs.
