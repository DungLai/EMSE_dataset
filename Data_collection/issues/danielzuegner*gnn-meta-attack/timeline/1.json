The reason why I use a different model is that it is rather cumbersome in Tensorflow to assign a new value to a SparseTensor. We could achieve this by using a sparse placeholder but this would be less efficient because the data would have to be passed at each training iteration.\r\n\r\nRegarding lines 344 and 345: You're correct, that was a bug.
