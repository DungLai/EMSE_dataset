However, I am not sure when it should be used. Is it for resetting states at the end of each epoch?\r\n\r\nAccording to my understanding, the `keras-metrics` is designed to avoid the incorrect approximation of recall on each batch. Thus, a practical solution is **computing the metrics on the end of each epoch independently**. \r\n\r\nBut in the [README.md](https://github.com/netrack/keras-metrics/blob/master/README.md), the given example is \r\n```py\r\nimport keras\r\nimport keras_metrics\r\n\r\nmodel = models.Sequential()\r\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=\"sigmoid\", input_dim=2))\r\nmodel.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=\"softmax\"))\r\n\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer=\"sgd\",\r\n              loss=\"binary_crossentropy\",\r\n              metrics=[keras_metrics.precision(), keras_metrics.recall()])\r\n```\r\nwhich directly pass the `keras_metrics.recall()` as metrics for batch-based usage. The problem in the demo is that the states may\\* not be resetted. Therefore, the recall value of each epoch will be dependent on previous epochs. \r\n\r\n\\* I am not sure if the `reset_states` method is called at the end of each epoch.
