I have been using multi-class average recall in most of my research projects in the past. I used to calculate them by callbacks, now I can finally add a metric.\r\n\r\nI have posted my implementation at this [gist](\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/HawkinsZhao/766305acfb0141b70370e5dcd9415eb6). Would be convenient to have a look at my work? If you are interested in it, I will be glad to submit a PR.\r\n\r\nThe multi-class average recall is a widely used metric in emotion classification and many other research problems. I think it could certainly benefit lots of people.","closed_by":{"login":"ybubnov","id":1778407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1778407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov","html_url":"https://github.com/ybubnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
