Content of the x_batch variable looks an\r\n# array of attribute vectors. Content of the y_batch looks like\r\n# an array of labels, where label is a value in a range [0, num_classes)\r\n#\r\n#  x_batch = [ [0.4, 0.2, ..., 0.1],\r\n#              [0.1, 0.3, ..., 0.2] ]\r\n#\r\n#  y_batch = [2, 1, ..., 9]\r\n#\r\nx_batch, y_batch = read_next()\r\ny_batch = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_batch, num_classes)\r\n\r\nmodel.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)\r\n\r\n# Retrieve the testing data from some source.\r\nx_true, y_true = read_next()\r\n\r\n# Binarize the output.\r\ny_true = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_true, num_classes)\r\n\r\n# Evaluate the metrics.\r\nloss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_true, y_true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> How does one interpret the output for precision/recall if a multi-class classifier is being trained?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if understood you question correctly. The precision/recall will be calculated on the evaluation step only, training does not trigger the metrics calculation. Metrics are calculated across all classes of a model and not on per-class basis.\r\n\r\nDo you want me to add this code snippet to the documentation as an example or do something else to improve the package understanding?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/comments/407179327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ybubnov","id":1778407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1778407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov","html_url":"https://github.com/ybubnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1748571787,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc0ODU3MTc4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/events/1748571787","actor":{"login":"gopchandani","id":898568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani","html_url":"https://github.com/gopchandani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T19:50:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1748571789,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NDg1NzE3ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/events/1748571789","actor":{"login":"gopchandani","id":898568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani","html_url":"https://github.com/gopchandani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopchandani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T19:50:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1748573369,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3NDg1NzMzNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/events/1748573369","actor":{"login":"ybubnov","id":1778407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1778407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov","html_url":"https://github.com/ybubnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-23T19:51:06Z","label":{"name":"kind/questoin","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/comments/409063571","html_url":"https://github.com/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/2#i
