try to run the unit test in the pull request #19 . I compare the false_positive value aganist below function:\r\n```py\r\ndef ref_false_pos(y_true, y_pred):\r\n    return np.sum(np.logical_and(np.round(y_pred)==1, y_true == 0))\r\ny_pred = model.predict(x)\r\nexpected_fp = ref_false_pos(y, y_pred)\r\n```\r\nThe values will not be equal occassionally. Even if I fixed the random seed by `\r\n        np.random.seed(2334)`, the inequality still happens occasionally.\r\n\r\nIs there any explanation for this stochastics?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/comments/439579643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jyhong836","id":6964516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjQ1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6964516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836","html_url":"https://github.com/jyhong836","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jyhong836/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/comments/439598416","html_url":"https://github.com/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/18#issuecomment-439598416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/netrack/keras-metrics/issues/18","id":439598416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTU5ODQxNg==","user":{"login":"ybubnov","id":1778407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1778407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov","html_url":"https://github.com/ybubnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybubnov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-17T08:09:55Z","updated_at":"2018-11-17T08:09:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jyhong836, could you, please post an example of run with failing test (output or input data).
