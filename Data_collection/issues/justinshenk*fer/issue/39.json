I have a question about GPU usage (it's not really an issue, so sorry if this is not the right way to ask):\r\n\r\nI'm using the detect_emotion() function providing already the bounding box of the faces, which come from previous data. I'm wondering, does the emotion classification part of the function use GPU acceleration? I've checked the source code and it's not clear to me, since it's using Tensorflow, which I know can support GPU directly in the recent versions. I know that face detection using mtcnn does use GPU acceleration, but I'm avoiding that part of the function by providing the bounding boxes.\r\n\r\nIn case it does use GPU acceleration to classify the emotions, I really don't think it provides any noteworthy improvements, since it's a very fast process and cannot be done in batches, am I right?\r\n\r\nThanks again!","closed_by":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
