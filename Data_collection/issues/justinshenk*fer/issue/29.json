I'm currently trying to use your fer to detect emotions on webcam video. I've installed your fer using `pip install fer`. But i've met two issues:\r\n1. When i'm initializing your detector as\r\n`detector = FER(mtcnn=True)`\r\ni'm getting \r\n`AttributeError: module 'keras.utils.generic_utils' has no attribute 'to_snake_case'`\r\ntensorflow 2.5.0, keras 2.4.3\r\n\r\n2. SInce i wanted only to use your model as emotion detector not face detector, i wanted to test your  `detector.detect_emotions` with parameter face_rectangles, so code looks like this\r\n```\r\nvideo_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\r\ndetector = FER()\r\nwhile True:\r\n    _, frame = video_capture.read() \r\n    box = detector.find_faces(frame)\r\n    emotions  = detector.detect_emotions(frame, face_rectangles=box)\r\n```\r\nSo, i'm trying to use fer's find_faces to test how it performs with only emotion detect. Unfortunately, on the line\r\n`emotions  = detector.detect_emotions(frame, face_rectangles=box)`\r\ni'm getting \r\n`ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`\r\non the line \r\n`if not face_rectangles:`\r\nin the file fer.py.\r\n\r\nMy understanding that it should be this if instead\r\n`if (face_rectangles is None):`\r\nWith this if it works fine. Could you please change this line in your project so other people, installed fer with pip, could use it with their own face detect?","closed_by":{"login":"DaddyWesker","id":10774222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzc0MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10774222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker","html_url":"https://github.com/DaddyWesker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
