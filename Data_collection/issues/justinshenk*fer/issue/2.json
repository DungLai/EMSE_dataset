Thank you for developing this!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get this package up and running in a docker image (Ubuntu 18.04), and everything seems to go smoothly until I try and run the video example. When I run it I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/fer/classes.py\", line 176, in analyze\r\n    assert self.cap.open(self.filepath), \"Video capture not opening\"\r\nAssertionError: Video capture not opening\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that this is because in docker you can't open Xwindow by default, so I turned the `display=True` to `display=False` but I still get the error. The image example works fine. Outside of docker, I can run the video example OK, and can even run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nraw_data = video.analyze(detector, display=False, output=\"pandas\", annotate_frames=False, save_frames=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout it opening an additional window. Any ideas on a work-around?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPS - I noticed when I built my docker image that you are missing `requests` from `requirements.txt`, and some of the code seems to only be compatible with python >= 3.6, not 3.4.
