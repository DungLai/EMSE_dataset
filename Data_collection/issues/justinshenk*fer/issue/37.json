I understand that  your model sees each and every frame of the video that is sent, but is there a way to make it parallelly run on more than 1 video so as to reduce the overall execution time?  \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
