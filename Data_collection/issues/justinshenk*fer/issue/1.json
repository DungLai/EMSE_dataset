Good work :+1: \r\n\r\nBut I did run into one (minor) issue:\r\n\r\nIt doesn't work if running on more than one discrete image in a row.\r\n\r\nThe first image analyzed with `FER().detect_emotions(img)` always works fine, but running the function again with a different image results in a tensorflow error (paraphrased, I lost the original): \"Tensorflow Tensor is not element of this graph\".\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what went wrong (I'm not too familiar with tensorflow), but wrapping the call in a `with tf.Session():` context manager resolved the issue. \r\n\r\nI hope you'll look into fixing this in the library, as it was really enjoyable to use (apart from this haunting bug).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
