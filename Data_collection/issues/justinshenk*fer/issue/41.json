Awesome project! I have been using it for the past days and I wonder something: what do you thing is the best heuristic to select a face, when multiple are detected but only one is in the picture?\r\n\r\nBasically, when running through a video, sometimes FER detects \"blobs\" as faces, which in reality are not. I was wondering if you have any criteria to pick the right one. I saw that in the method `top_emotion` you just take the first one, is that always the case?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
