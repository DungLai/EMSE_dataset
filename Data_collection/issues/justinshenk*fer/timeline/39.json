It will use a GPU if it is available. You can verify this with \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\ntf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(\r\n    enabled=True\r\n)\r\n```\r\nWhether there is a performance improvement for using a GPU, probably not a lot. The biggest improvement would probably come from batching, as you suggested. This would be an additional feature, which would require a bit of refactoring but could be added. Let me know if this is important for your use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/1050805498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/1065856824","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk/fer/issues/39#issuecomment-1065856824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/39","id":1065856824,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCPJ3J84_h684","user":{"login":"rafamestre","id":13152269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUyMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13152269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre","html_url":"https://github.com/rafamestre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamestre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-12T10:18:13Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T10:18:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Justin, I'm so sorry for the very late reply. For some reason I was not subscribed to this and didn't get the notification!\r\n\r\nThanks for the info. Just wanted to make sure I understood everything correctly. I guess batch recognition could be a nice feature, but it's definitely not important for my case, so don't worry about it. Thanks a lot for the offer though! The performance is already great as it is and it's not much of a bottleneck - CPU parallelisation gives fast results!\r\n\r\nThanks again!
