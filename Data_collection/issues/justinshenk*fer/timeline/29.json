Hey guys, some of these errors should have been fixed in the newly released mtcnn v0.1.1, now required in fer v21.0.2. This mtcnn version replaced all keras calls with tensorflow. Please pip install -U fer and let me know it goes.\r\n\r\nHello. I've updated mtcnn and fer and after that i'm getting this\r\n```\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/daddywesker/EmotionRecognition/FER/testing_fer.py\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    detector = FER(mtcnn=True)\r\n  File \"/home/daddywesker/anaconda3/envs/fer/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fer/fer.py\", line 120, in __init__\r\n    self.__emotion_classifier = load_model(emotion_model, compile=compile)\r\n  File \"/home/daddywesker/anaconda3/envs/fer/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/saving/save.py\", line 146, in load_model\r\n    return hdf5_format.load_model_from_hdf5(filepath, custom_objects, compile)\r\n  File \"/home/daddywesker/anaconda3/envs/fer/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py\", line 166, in load_model_from_hdf5\r\n    model_config = json.loads(model_config.decode('utf-8'))\r\nAttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'\r\n\r\nProcess finished with exit code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeleting `.decode('utf-8')` part helps but i'm editing keras code this way. And there are some more places with such a problem. DOn't know if my solution is right.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/877993530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DaddyWesker","id":10774222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzc0MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10774222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker","html_url":"https://github.com/DaddyWesker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaddyWesker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"linguist89","id":52411527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDExNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52411527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89","html_url":"https://github.com/linguist89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linguist89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-12T09:03:46Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T09:03:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/23","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/23/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/23/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/23/events","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk/fer/issues/23","id":925003983,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjUwMDM5ODM=","number":23,"title":"Doesn't
