What I want to say is that mtcnn has a computational method to calculate which face is closest to the image center when multiple faces are detected, and then choose this face as the last face because of the work I have done. Only one face needs to be detected, so I use this method, the effect is as follows:\r\n![justin_drawn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24581773/61452162-bd203c00-a98d-11e9-9c16-9919150218be.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe calculation code is as follows:\r\n```\r\nbounding_boxes= self._mtcnn.detect_faces(img)\r\nif len(bounding_boxes) > 1:\r\n     faces_list = np.array([x[\"box\"] for x in bounding_boxes])     \r\n     bounding_box_size = (faces_list[:, 2] - faces_list[:, 0]) * (faces_list[:, 3] - faces_list[:, 1])\r\n    img_center = img_size / 2\r\n    offsets = np.vstack([(faces_list[:, 0] + faces_list[:, 2]) / 2 - img_center[1],\r\n                                 (faces_list[:, 1] + faces_list[:, 3]) / 2 - img_center[0]])\r\n    offset_dist_squared = np.sum(np.power(offsets, 2.0), 0)\r\n    index = np.argmax(\r\n    bounding_box_size - offset_dist_squared * 2.0)\r\n    faces= [faces_list[index].tolist()]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope it will be helpful to you. Of course, I support the method of displaying the emotions of multiple faces with multiple faces.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/512768843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhouhao-learning","id":24581773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTgxNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24581773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouhao-learning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhao-learning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2492327717,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ5MjMyNzcxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/2492327717","actor":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-18T10:58:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2492327720,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0OTIzMjc3MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/2492327720","actor":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-18T10:58:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/521250347","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk/fer/issues/5#issuecomment-521250347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/5","id":521250347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTI1MDM0Nw==","user":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T13:41:02Z","u
