@Saran-nns and @justinshenk,\r\n\r\nMy results were similar...\r\nIf there is any problem with the GPU initialization (similar to your example, @Saran-nns), then the system falls back using the CPU, so everything works (or at least it looks like).\r\nBut if the GPU initialization is OK, than after that there will be errors.\r\n\r\nSo I think the question is still pending...\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nCsaba","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/comments/908674647/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kormoczi","id":7091692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTE2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7091692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi","html_url":"https://github.com/kormoczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kormoczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5228550089,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIyODU1MDA4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/5228550089","actor":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-30T20:34:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5228550093,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMjg1NTAwOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/5228550093","actor":{"login":"justinshenk","id":10270308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjcwMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10270308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk","html_url":"https://github.com/justinshenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinshenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-30T20:34:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5228550098,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIyODU1MDA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/5228550098","actor":{"login":"Saran-nns","id":13406046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDA2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13406046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns","html_url":"https://github.com/Saran-nns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saran-nns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-30T20:34:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5228550102,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMjg1NTAxMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinshenk/fer/issues/events/5228550102","actor":{"login":"Sa
