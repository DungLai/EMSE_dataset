I hope you're well and healthy. Please forgive me as I am very new to DeepLabCut and coding in general. I will try to provide as much information as I can, and will be glad to give you more if needed.\r\n\r\n**Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, DeepLabCut v2.2b6, with an Anaconda Environment (DLC)**\r\n\r\nI created a project to track hand movements of people. After creating the project, I was successfully able to edit the config.yaml to my needs (see below), extract frames (50 total), and label the frames. However, when I went to create the training dataset, I got the following error. Any help is greatly appreciated; I am not understanding where it is getting more than two items from in the config.yaml file. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-7-39b975463e08> in <module>\r\n----> 1 deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config, augmenter_type='imgaug')\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/dlc/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/trainingsetmanipulation.py in create_training_dataset(config, num_shuffles, Shuffles, windows2linux, userfeedback, trainIndices, testIndices, net_type, augmenter_type)\r\n    899 \r\n    900         Data = merge_annotateddatasets(\r\n--> 901             cfg, Path(os.path.join(project_path, trainingsetfolder)), windows2linux\r\n    902         )\r\n    903         if Data is None:\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/dlc/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/trainingsetmanipulation.py in merge_annotateddatasets(cfg, trainingsetfolder_full, windows2linux)\r\n    591     videos = cfg[\"video_sets\"].keys()\r\n    592     for video in videos:\r\n--> 593         _, filename, _ = _robust_path_split(video)\r\n    594         if cfg.get(\"croppedtraining\", False):\r\n    595             filename += \"_cropped\"\r\n\r\n~/anaconda3/envs/dlc/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/trainingsetmanipulation.py in _robust_path_split(path)\r\n    575     sep = \"\\\\\" if \"\\\\\" in path else \"/\"\r\n    576     parent, file = path.rsplit(sep, 1)\r\n--> 577     filename, ext = file.split(\".\")\r\n    578     return parent, filename, ext\r\n    579 \r\n\r\n**ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)**\r\n\r\n![119](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66268566/84094789-d3c2ed80-a9ba-11ea-9014-e8e3f01487ca.JPG)\r\n![120](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66268566/84094790-d45b8400-a9ba-11ea-9a86-37265e38f479.JPG)\r\n![121](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66268566/84094792-d45b8400-a9ba-11ea-8cc2-6d5c22e51e6b.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
