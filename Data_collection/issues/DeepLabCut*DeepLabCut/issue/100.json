Once I labelled all single points and save their locations as separate cvs files (as in DLC1), how can I integrate them to DLC2?\r\n\r\nAlso, where can I set the size of the upper left box in each frame, where one clicked to ignore that frame for training, say for occluded features (again, as was done in DLC1)?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!
