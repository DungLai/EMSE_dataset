The issue is that the extracted frames are non-uniformly spaced throughout the video, and differ each time I run extract_frames(). \r\n\r\nMy guess is that this is because [the Index argument passed to UniformFramesCV2 is None by default](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/cd4f2f558424ed26e4b431097db1ced607c9adc9/deeplabcut/utils/frameselectiontools.py#L80), and not set correctly [when the function is called in extract_frames](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/cd4f2f558424ed26e4b431097db1ced607c9adc9/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/frame_extraction.py#L258).\r\n\r\nWhen extracting, I used the following code: \r\n\r\n`deeplabcut.extract_frames(config_path, mode='automatic', algo='uniform', userfeedback=False, crop=False) grabs unique frame numbers each time.\r\n`\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina)\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.8.2\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: single animal tracking \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1.
