Please fill out the template completely, including the full \"traceback\" and input code that you ran to hit this error.\r\n\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nDeepLabCut Version:  2.2\r\nAnaconda env used: GPU\r\n\r\nI used the GUI to label the videos and I can see the excel spreadsheets with values stored in the excel, but when I click the \"Check Labels!\" button in the GUI, it says that there are not any labeled data. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57931859/92188591-db572e80-ee11-11ea-8273-6a33296af0c7.png)\r\n\r\nPlease place code inside this:\r\n\r\nnote to user: currently only ResNet50-v1 is available for maDLC\r\nnote to user: currently model comparison is not available in maDLC\r\nCreating images with labels by Walter.\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_1_top does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_2_top does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_3_top does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_1_side does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_2_side does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\FIP_computer\\Trial Run -Walter-2020-08-26\\labeled-data\\test_video_3_side does not appear to have labeled data!\r\nIf all the labels are ok, then use the function 'create_training_dataset' to create the training dataset!\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to Deeplabcut 2.2 and load a previously labeled project\r\n2. Click on label frames\r\n3. Click on \"Check Labels!\"\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\nThis problem is likely due to some prior set-up or procedural problem that I am unaware about.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThis is for the additional context section.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57931859/92188904-adbeb500-ee12-11ea-904d-40441ebcb32d.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI assume that because the software does not believe that I have files that are labeled, it is unable to create a training data-set. It did say output a FileNotFoundError and looked at a different sub file directory for a file that did not exist in the folder. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
