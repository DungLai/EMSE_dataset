Output can't be displayed. An error that has to do with a mismatch between C/C++ and Windows locale shows up (see Relevant log output).\r\n2. There is a warning regarding using GPU.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to get some assistance in the matter.\r\nThanks!\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nversion 2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a project using GUI.\r\n2. Extract frames - default.\r\n3. Label Data -> Label Frames -> worked as expected.\r\n4. Label Data ->Check Labels! -> shows locale error.\r\n5. Anytime an output is requested the locale error shows again. For example in Evaluate->Optional: Plot 3 test maps, or Create videos->Bluid skeleton.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nreturn wx.Bitmap(str(cbook._get_data_path('images', filename)))\r\nwx._core.wxAssertionError: C++ assertion \"strcmp(setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL), \"C\") == 0\" failed at ..\\..\\src\\common\\intl.cpp(1579) in wxLocale::GetInfo(): You probably called setlocale() directly instead of using wxLocale and now there is a mismatch between C/C++ and Windows locale.\r\nThings are going to break, please only change locale by creating wxLocale objects to avoid this!\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThere is an error when starting the GUI regarding the GPU use:\r\n\r\n2022-07-26 19:49:59.225377: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'cudart64_110.dll'; dlerror: cudart64_110.dll not found\r\n2022-07-26 19:49:59.233256: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cudart_stub.cc:29] Ignore above cudart dlerror if you do not have a GPU set up on your machine.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
