You need to do this manually for including it in the config.yaml file!`\r\n\r\nThe extracted frames are still added to the labeled-data folder, inside a subfolder with the name of the video. Plus, `refine_labels` worked, in that it allowed me to label the frames (I didn't spot the error message until afterwards), and created `Collected_Data_Username.h5` files.\r\n\r\nHowever, subsequently running `merge_datasets` appears to fail (despite not throwing any errors) as `check_labels` does not create images with labels for the new videos. Presumably, this is because they're not referenced in `config.yaml`?.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what might be causing the automatic adding failure, and are there any potential fixes?\r\n\r\nAlso, if I [manually add the videos](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/232) at this stage (having refined the outlier labels), will I still be able to use my newly refined labels?\r\n\r\nThanks v. much\r\n\r\nPaul. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pauljerem","id":31322182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzIyMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31322182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem","html_url":"https://github.com/pauljerem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauljerem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
