I've just started to transition to version 2.2 for multi-animal tracking. I've been working almost entirely within the Project Manager (though I previously used older versions of DLC in a jupyter notebook).\r\n\r\nI set up my first multi-animal project and it seemed to be going smoothly through the evaluate network stage. After evaluate it successfully made the example maps. When I went to analyze the videos, however, I started getting an error and I don't know what to make of it. Thanks for any help you can provide!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's relevant or a separate issue, but I also had some issues with the skeleton (it said \"no fully labelled animal was found\") but thought it might still work since the training/evaluation seemed ok. If you think I need to go back and resolve that first, let me know!\r\n```\r\nThe terminal looked like this:\r\n(dlc-windowsGPU) D:\\>python -m deeplabcut\r\nStarting GUI...\r\nnote to user: currently only ResNet50-v1 is available for maDLC\r\nnote to user: currently model comparision is not available in maDLC\r\nAnalyzing ...\r\nUsing snapshot-200000 for model D:\\Users\\rhush\\Desktop\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLC-LK-2020-05-25\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLCMay25-trainset95shuffle1\r\nInitializing ResNet\r\nActivating extracting of PAFs\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:52.185776: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX AVX2\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:52.882906: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1433] Found device 0 with properties:\r\nname: GeForce GTX 1070 major: 6 minor: 1 memoryClockRate(GHz): 1.683\r\npciBusID: 0000:02:00.0\r\ntotalMemory: 8.00GiB freeMemory: 6.64GiB\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:52.904238: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1512] Adding visible gpu devices: 0\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:53.819234: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:984] Device interconnect StreamExecutor with strength 1 edge matrix:\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:53.830185: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:990]      0\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:53.836555: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1003] 0:   N\r\n2020-05-29 12:16:53.844706: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1115] Created TensorFlow device (/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 6387 MB memory) -> physical GPU (device: 0, name: GeForce GTX 1070, pci bus id: 0000:02:00.0, compute capability: 6.1)\r\nStarting to analyze %  D:\\Users\\rhush\\Desktop\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLC-LK-2020-05-25\\test_iteration0\\behavCam2_414d2t1.avi\r\nD:\\Users\\rhush\\Desktop\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLC-LK-2020-05-25\\test_iteration0  already exists!\r\nLoading  D:\\Users\\rhush\\Desktop\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLC-LK-2020-05-25\\test_iteration0\\behavCam2_414d2t1.avi\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\gui\\analyze_videos.py\", line 477, in analyze_videos\r\n    robust_nframes=robust,\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\predict_videos.py\", line 300, in analyze_videos\r\n    robust_nframes=robust_nframes,\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\predict_multianimal.py\", line 57, in AnalyzeMultiAnimalVideo\r\n    nframes = auxfun_videos.get_nframes_robust(video)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\utils\\auxfun_videos.py\", line 293, in get_nframes_robust\r\n    output = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\subprocess.py\", line 356, in check_output\r\n    **kwargs).stdout\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\rhush\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc-windowsGPU\\lib\\subprocess.py\", line 438, in run\r\n    output=stdout, stderr=stderr)\r\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'ffprobe -i D:\\Users\\rhush\\Desktop\\Direct2VIPscope_MultiAnimalDLC-LK-2020-05-25\\test_iteration0\\behavCam2_414d2t1.avi -v error -count_frames -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=nb_read_frames -of default=nokey=1:noprint_wrappers=1' returned non-zero exit status 1.\r\n```\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
