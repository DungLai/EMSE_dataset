I was renaming the project directory but forgot to adjust the video path. When I wanted to extract frames, I got a `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero` error because of `--> 140                     duration=nframes*1./fps` instead of a file not found error. Once corrected, the frame extraction was not only limited to the video file specified in the config files, but attempted to extract frames for all movie files found in the movie directory. Therefore, it appears that specifying the video in the config file is not efficient and maybe not necessary if per default all videos in the subdirectory are used.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nA) ZeroDivisionError\r\n1. rename video path in the config file in a way that there is no file found\r\n2. execute `deeplabcut.extract_frames`\r\n\r\nB) load additional movies not specified in config file\r\n1. Copy an additional movie file into the videos subdirectory of the project\r\n2. execute `deeplabcut.extract_frames`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIn the first case I would expect to get an error that indicates that a file is not found, instead the error refers to a problem with the frame rate.\r\nIn the second case I would expect to only use video specified in the config file. \r\nIf videos are copied or linked into the videos subdirectory, there seems not to be a reason to specify videos by their absolute path, video names should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS :Linux Mint 19.1\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.0.9\r\n - Browser: Firefox\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
