How similar should the videos in question be?\r\n\r\nFor example in the demos, multiple videos of mice reaching are used. These are quite similar. However, if I wanted to look at different species of lizard videos (geckos, iguanas, komodo dragons e.t.c) for example, would it be wise to use the same overarching project for all the videos or should I use a project for each distinct video?\r\n\r\nMany Thanks.
