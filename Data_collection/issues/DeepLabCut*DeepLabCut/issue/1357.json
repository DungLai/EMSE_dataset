After training, I had the network label a video with 8 fish and I am now at the refine tracklets stage. The beginning frames have fish 1-8, but as the video continues sometimes the fish labels for one of the fish will disappear and be replaced with labels from fish 9. I know that the lasso tool can be used to move incorrectly placed labels onto the correct fish, but is there a way to fix the labels on a fish when the correct labels are no longer on the frame and have been replaced by labels for a new individual?\r\n\r\nHere are screenshots of two frames where F9 is added.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1145\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-25 at 4 10 27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86495175/123480203-fe84e180-d5cf-11eb-9823-1c8588a796e1.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1056\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-25 at 4 10 37 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86495175/123480233-093f7680-d5d0-11eb-927d-cc4fe88ca08c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
