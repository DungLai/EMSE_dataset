In some frames, deep lab cut correctly identifies that the body part is obscured and does not apply a label, however; in some cases it seems deep lab cut will 'Force' the label of the obscured body-part, often putting it directly over top of another (Correct) label.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nGood results when all body-parts visible:\r\n![Training-2018121360-img1737](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49211357/70266611-aff3c600-1751-11ea-9d86-bcac4305ce31.png)\r\n\r\nTail gets placed on head when tail is not visible:\r\n![Test-2018121290-img1510](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49211357/70266124-c4838e80-1750-11ea-8022-d108242f2033.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThese are the results form snapshot 650000, I am unsure how to evaluate earlier snapshots, which I feel may preform better so any help with that would be great.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
