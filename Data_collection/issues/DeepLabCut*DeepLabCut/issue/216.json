I am very new to using this kind of program, and just using the terminal is still a learning process, but the instructions are quite straight-forward. However, the problem I mostly seem to run into is regarding the nvidia docker when trying to start the docker container from the image using \r\n\r\nGPU=1 bash ./dlc-docker run -d -p 2351:8888 -e USER_HOME=$HOME/DeepLabCut --name containername dlc_username/dlcdocker\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below shows the result of that command.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2019-02-19 13-38-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47774575/53015594-b7104880-344b-11e9-8b50-56d1f9349a9f.png)\r\n\r\nThe error message is:\r\n\r\n1 nvidia-docker run -v /home/poop:/home/poop -p 47133:22 -p 2351:8888 -e USER_GROUPS=sudo -e USER=poop -e USER_ID=1000 -e USER_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD=aa5V9MSdgw5ec -e USER_HOME=/home/poop -e GPU=1 -e DISPLAY=:0 -d -e USER_HOME=/home/poop/DeepLabCut --name containername dlc_username/dlcdocker\r\nnvidia-docker | 2019/02/19 13:34:40 Error: invalid device: 1\r\n\r\nFrom what I've gathered, this suggests some kind of incompatibility, am I correct?
