In the config.yaml I set identity: true and applied the default DLCRnet. When I train the network through gui, it shows IndexError: list index out of range. Then it stuck at “starting multi-animal training” and do not proceed. The question is present only if Identity is set as true. \r\nOne more thing I am not sure if it is relevant to this issue: I defined 15 bodyparts but not all of them were labeled in each frame. For example, if right hand is occluded, I skipped that body part and continue to label the next.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu20.04\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc2\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: multi-animal tracking\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nAs described in the bug\r\n\r\n<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n^do not delete the above \"<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\" or the ```python part!\r\nPLACE YOUR CODE HERE!!!  \r\ndo not delete below this line, leave the blank line and the ```\r\n\r\n```\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nProceeds to training\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
