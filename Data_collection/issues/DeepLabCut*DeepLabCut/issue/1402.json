Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nI have noticed that images when opened in the GUI sometimes look different than when viewed in video. Often this is to the detriment of labeling. Features that are low contrast in videos sometimes become even lower contrast when opened in the GUI. Not sure if I am noticing this only because of how I am recording videos (openCV and pypylon) but it is annoying.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nA slider in the labeling GUI that changes image contrast. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\nI think maybe also a sharpness slider could help as well. There are a number of image alterations that can be done to change how an image looks. I think the degrees of freedom for what best alteration for a particular problem image would help is difficult to predict. Having the option to do a few simple alterations on the fly to help with labeling could be useful and fun. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind taking a shot at coding this but I am unfamiliar with wxPython and found the GUI code difficult to read. I actually have no idea where in the codebase this code would be inserted. I have found that sometimes using the zoom tool as a 'highlighter' can help me see the low contrast features, this is not a great solution as once you zoom the 'highlighting' effect disappears and you have to guess. We have been trying to train students to label images using deeplabcut and have found it difficult to teach low contrast body feature labeling. Often folks just do a poor guess even when if interrogated the body feature is visible. Unfortunately, data sometimes is just how it is no going back and making sure you record with an extra lamp in corner x. deeplabcut is actually able to handle labeling low contrast features, it often does worse on them but it still can handle it. If you can label them often so can the model.
