I’ve attached one of the graphs here\r\n![plot-likelihood_filtered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27425366/172090842-912b05fb-5201-435a-82f1-dcb753c3ee55.png)\r\n:\r\nAlso, in my case the issue is not the p-value cut off. Setting it as low as possible does not repopulate the plots. And the p-values for the frames are pretty much all >.9 for my csv files.\n\n### Operating System\n\nos:windows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version:2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu:3080\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI folllowed the instroduction step by step:\r\nInteractive Project Manager GUI[https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/PROJECT_GUI.html](url)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nUsing snapshot-20000 for model C:\\DeepLabCut0601\\hand-yyk-2022-06-01\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\handJun1-trainset95shuffle1\r\nC:\\Users\\Citydo\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python38\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\python\\keras\\engine\\base_layer_v1.py:1692: UserWarning: `layer.apply` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
