Please describe.**\r\nI have been getting superb tracking with maDLC (I am  using it with single animal videos). I think the skeleton feature saved us so much time and effort to clean little tracking issues we were having with the previous version. However, using maDLC for single animal tracking is not super ideal for a couple of reasons:\r\n - The assembly and refinement steps are not necessary for single animal videos. \r\n - maDLC, naturally, can not benefit from features that are available for single animal tracking such as dynamic cropping. Thus, the analysis of videos are are slower and the speed is sacrificed in exchange of greater flexibility in refining after analysis.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n - It would be great if there is a version of maDLC that uses dynamic cropping with single animal videos while benefiting from improved tracking with the skeleton feature. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- I have tried refining my trained model as much as possible in 2.1.8.2. Labeled over 1k frames, from 10 different animals with a variety of training settings (different augmentation methods, different optimizers etc). However, it never reached the perfermonce of maDLC. \r\n- To circumvent the analysis speed I am currently paying for colab pro and running 4 sessions at a time plus the 1080 Ti on my computer. This setup can chew 170 gb of vid data in less than 24 hours. It pains me that my vid files are very large so to speed up processing I am also playing with diff compression methods. However, the model works great for the videos we have and storage is cheap.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/974/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/974/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
