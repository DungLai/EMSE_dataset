When I got to the part where I needed to use the GUI to label frames, it no longer worked. This is when I realized that I have to use pythonw, since I'm on a Mac. However, when I try to import deeplabcut in pythonw, it doesn't work anymore. How could this be happening?\r\n\r\nI included a screenshot that demonstrates ipython importing DeepLabCut properly and then pythonw failing to import deeplabcut immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"631\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-23 at 4 58 57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/94074020-1370e200-fdbe-11ea-86d7-ebf86bed4976.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"withercp","id":70550808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTUwODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70550808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp","html_url":"https://github.com/withercp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
