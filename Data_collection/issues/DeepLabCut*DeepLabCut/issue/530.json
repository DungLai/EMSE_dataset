Attempt to train network on Reaching-Mackenzie labeled dataset.\r\n2. Iterations are displayed, but after several hours come back and the window has closed (I think the program crashed), and the training does not complete. \r\n\r\nIt is strange because my GPU usage seems to be very high; it changes to 90% as soon as I start training the network. However, the process that begins once I start training the network is called \"Insufficient permission\" (the process with type \"C\") next to it. I have uninstalled and re-installed DLC several times (wiping the computer inbetween), and the last time I did this I was seeing high GPU usage, but I actually was able to see python, not insufficient permissions. \r\n\r\nIt is also strange because I installed CUDA 10.0, but NVIDIA-smi command is showing CUDA 10.2.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that the training should be able to complete without crashing, so I am wondering if there is a GPU issue. \r\n\r\nI completed all of the tests described in this post:\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/362\r\n\r\nI also followed the tips given in the installation guide for checking if the GPU is engaging. I am a very new user so any help would be greatly appreciated. I have attached screenshots of what my NVIDIA-smi looks like. Finally, I am wondering: Could it be related to the computer idling overnight? I have read in other posts that maybe this is an issue. \r\n\r\n![GPU usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58533662/70855083-a832d080-1e79-11ea-8387-6f75bdc61b0e.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a side note, when I originally activated the anaconda environment, DLC was not installed and a file titled \"condaenv.cqm5tu9r.requirements\" appeared in my Downloads. I haven't had this issue the past two installations (I made sure to activate the environment in administrator mode). When I activated the environment, I did \"pip install numpy==1.17.2\" because I think this might have been the issue. Then I did pip install deeplabcut, and deeplabcut seemed to be functioning normally. I doubt that these two issues are related, but I thought I would say so just in case.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
