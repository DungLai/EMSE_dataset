I have a trouble when I try to expend training set, could help me to understand the error?\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10 with an Anaconda Env\r\nDeepLabCut Version: maDLC-GPU 2.2b8 \r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\n\r\nI got an error message when I tried to train network with expended training set. After the initial training, I refined the tracklets using refine tracklet GUI, and merge refine data. After done this, I also refined label using refine label GUI, merge the dataset afterwards, which successfully created a new 'iteration-1' folder in trainingset folder. I created training set using Create training set, (I set the \"specify the training dataset index\" as 1), which works well. After creating the new training set, I tried to train network, and when I set  \"specify the training dataset index\" as 1, DLC gives me an error IndexError: list index out of range\r\n\r\nWhich part I was missing here? Could you help me to understand the error?
