After labeling the images on my Mac using the GUI, I trained a network for 120,000 iterations on Google Colab and evaluated the network. The trained network seems to be working well with a train error of 3.01 and test error of 5.32. However, when I try to analyze the videos on google Colab, it does not do anything. I have attached an image of the google Colab output below. It does not produce any errors and seems to work well, but then when I go to my videos folder on google drive nothing new has been created, and I am unable to do the plot_trajectories step or extract_outlier_frames step on Google Colab. I found another post similar to this where you were able to help resolve the issue, but I do not think there are any issues with my config file, so I am unsure how to proceed. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1218\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 12 08 52 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/109338200-8b3eaf00-782b-11eb-87f8-4b9c7a481760.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1221\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 12 09 08 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/109338210-8f6acc80-782b-11eb-9d43-718c381b538e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1228\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 12 10 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/109338224-942f8080-782b-11eb-972f-907609f1ca86.png\">\r\n\r\nHere are images of my config file so that you can make sure everything has been formatted properly:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 12 12 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/109338494-f7b9ae00-782b-11eb-894b-f65b5b36696d.png\">\r\n<img width=\"684\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 12 12 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70550808/109338502-fb4d3500-782b-11eb-8f51-7251af8727e0.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
