Everything was going smoothly with labeling body parts, however once I finished this with my test set, I noticed there was no button for building skeletons. \r\n\r\nI couldn't figure this out, but had assumed it had something to do with my gtk library warnings. Tried installing the docker version (latest) and ran into the same issue. Contacted ITS at my university, who had play around with the docker version on their test rig, and then dug into the code and found that the skeleton builder had been commented out. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering why this is? Has that function been superseded? From watching the youtube tutorials it seemed as though that was a pretty integral part required for training. \r\n\r\nAny information would be very helpful\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 20.04.4 LTS\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nLatest docker version\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGeForce RTX 3070\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
