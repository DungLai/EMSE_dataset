Specifically:\r\n- Some images for labeling have missing labels. These missing labels were present when visualizing the frame and manually selecting it.\r\n- There seems to be an issue with indexing, if I go back to image 0 (for example, I move forward and go back) the labels in image 0 are displaced. \r\n- In order to mark missing labels, if I go to labels frames in the gui and select a folder with refined labels, the labels are wrong, as if they belonged to another frame.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there might be an issue with the indexing, maybe in the .h5 files. In the machinelabels.csv the order of the images is not sorted, and this might call the wrong labels in the label frames function. \r\n\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.5.2\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
