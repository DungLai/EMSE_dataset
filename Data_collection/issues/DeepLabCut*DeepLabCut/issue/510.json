I do the training with 20000 iterations, MobileNet (since my video is large, so i do not set up the iteration times higher), \r\nand the training results is :\r\nResults for 20000  training iterations: 95 1 train error: 1.57 pixels. Test error: 7.43  pixels.\r\nWith pcutoff of 0.1  train error: 1.57 pixels. Test error: 7.43 pixels\r\nNext i continue the following steps, and finish all the procedures. \r\nI tried to open the filtered video produced by the program and i found there are several problems:\r\none is the label animal is not the one i labeled for training before(i have many animals within one video and most of animals are marked with number tag) and the label objects jump to another animals with another number tag or even jump to animals without number tag, and sometimes even jump to the wall of the space where the animals live. \r\nthe second is the results of the plot_poses, they alÄº look ugly: \r\n![hist_filtered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397232/69947140-50957c00-14ed-11ea-8a0d-f9267304e5bc.png)\r\n![plot_filtered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397232/69947141-50957c00-14ed-11ea-90aa-7e032c29ae74.png)\r\n![plot-likelihood_filtered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397232/69947142-50957c00-14ed-11ea-8dca-80de44678c36.png)\r\n![trajectory_filtered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397232/69947143-50957c00-14ed-11ea-9e29-be593ec086ad.png)\r\n\r\nI am a freshman to use DLC, can you please help me to figure out what the problem would be? \r\nAnd can i use the compressed video to analyse, since i have many big video and it would take  quite a lot of time to do it?\r\nThank you for help. \r\nBest regards\r\nChen\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
