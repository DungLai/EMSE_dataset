The setup consists of 2 lateral cameras (one on the left and one on the right) and a mouse box. The videos I took can be viewed here :\r\nVideo 1: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z7xpwj2z03l7d2n/ch01_20210414104348_001.avi?dl=0\r\nVideo 2: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sorcrovgya0ay6z/ch02_20210414104348_001.avi?dl=0 \r\n\r\nAfter taking the videos, I extracted the frames, chose the best ones among them and put them in the calibration_images file. \r\nHowever, when I run the command to calibrate the cameras, it doesn't find the corners of any of the images. \r\n\r\nThis is the command I run : deeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path3d, cbrow=3, cbcol=4, calibrate=False, alpha=0.9)\r\nAnd the output is: \r\nCorners not found for the image camera-1-001.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image camera-2-001.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image camera-1-002.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image camera-2-002.jpg\r\n...\r\nCorners not found for the image camera-1-174.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image camera-2-174.jpg\r\nCorners extracted! You may check for the extracted corners in the directory C:\\Users\\e.petropoulou\\demo-eviana-2021-04-11-3d\\corners and remove the pair of images where the corners are incorrectly detected. If all the corners are detected correctly with right order, then re-run the same function and use the flag ``calibrate=True``, to calbrate the camera.\r\n\r\nThe corners folder is empty, because no corners are found. I have tried changing the alpha parameter and increasing the contrast. Also, I thought that there may be a reflexion problem, but even when I paint on the reflexion (so that it's not spotted), the corners are still not detected and thus not extracted. \r\nLast but not least, I would like to let you know that I can not move the cameras from the box and the biggest chessboard size I can use is 5x5 (however, in the videos provided I am using a 5x4 chessboard). \r\n\r\nAny advice would be of great help, since I've been struggling with this step for some time now. \r\nThank you in advance and have a nice day! \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
