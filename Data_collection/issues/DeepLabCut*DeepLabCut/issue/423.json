I came up across the the cuDNN handle error stemming from either cuDNN version mismatch or memory overflow, so I managed it by adding:\r\n\r\n    gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.8) \r\n    sess = TF.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))\r\n\r\nto train.py, training.py, test.py and predict_videos.py in pose_estimation_tensorflow, right after tf/TF version verification. here:\r\n\r\n    vers = (tf.__version__).split('.')\r\n    if int(vers[0])==1 and int(vers[1])>12:\r\n        TF=tf.compat.v1\r\n    else:\r\n        TF=tf\r\n\r\nthe training worked well, got 700k steps in 15hrs, converged to below 0.01 loss, but when I try to analyze the video it finishes the analysis at 2% and out of 5K frames in the video I get like 50 frame coordinates in the csv file. No error no nothing. It just gives up.\r\nI have tried setting gputouse in Analyze_videos to =None, but it basically ignored me \r\nThought I can get away with it, but apparently Nope. any solutions to this?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
