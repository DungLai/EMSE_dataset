Perhaps it's only related to my system, but when I set copy_videos under deeplabcut.create_new_project I get an OSError: symbolic link privilege not held. None of the other commands work as config.yaml isn't created. _This is not an issue when setting copy_videos = True (everything else works fine when set to True)._ \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nSet Config_path to False.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSymbolic path to videos would be created, config.yaml would be created under working_directory.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"693\" alt=\"dlc bug\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40471641/53758231-77a21d00-3e8b-11e9-9dd9-8cf93e25f908.PNG\">\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUsing python 3.6.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
