However, at high levels of injury, we find that the injury causes abnormal gait, which in turns obstructs some features from the camera capture volume in several frames. DLC recognizes that the features are missing and produces a low likelihood for the x,y coordinates in the analysis csv file. Since the features are obstructed in those select frames, it does not matter how many training sessions we do, DLC will not be able to find the features because it can't see the features. Once the features are back in view, DLC is able to find and track the features with near perfect accuracy. What I would like to do is manually extract the obstructed features frames (like we do with the extract function), but instead of labeling and retraining, I'd like to manually correct the x,y coordinates in the analysis csv file. Is there a feature that can do this? \r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
