wx\r\n>>> import matplotlib\r\n>>> matplotlib.use('WXagg')\r\n>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File

framework, as 'headless' is currently running\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange the backend of matplotlib GUI to \"Agg\" has no import problem as below:\r\n```import wx\r\nimport matplotlib\r\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nso I revised the matplotlib backend in \r\n`/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/deeplabcut/__init__.py`,  in this way, the `import deeplabcut` works.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib as mpl\r\ntry:\r\n    import wx\r\n    #mpl.use(\"WxAgg\")\r\n    mpl.use(\"Agg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the sub-modules and functions somewhere else in this package are solely designated as `WXagg`, such as the follow\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24669435/154421170-a98b96f9-0732-474b-92c9-7528af3b1a3e.png)\r\nso the workaround way of setting as \"Agg\" backend also failed work\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 18.04 on a desktop machine, i.e., with a monitor connected to it\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nDeepLabCut version `2.2.0.2` from the below docker
