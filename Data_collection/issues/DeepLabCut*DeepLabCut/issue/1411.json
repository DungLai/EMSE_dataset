One is on a windows computer and one on a mac. I combined the two folders and changed all the appropriate names so that the .config file has access to all the data. \r\n\r\nThen i changed this command in COLAB to include the windows to linux conversion :\r\ndeeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file, net_type='resnet_50', Shuffles=[SHUF], augmenter_type='imgaug',windows2linux=True)\r\n\r\nWhen that command was not available it would shoot the common error that people were getting when loading windows files.\r\n\r\nNow everything works fine i.e I can make a training set but as you can see from the screenshot below the training data is separated for the windows files and the mac files. The .mat file only contains the training data coming from the mac (and i assume also the pickle file). So when I run the training it is not including all the available data. \r\n\r\nAny tips on how to merge these successfully for training in COLAB would be awesome. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 11 54 52 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15024880/125677056-1474a05e-627e-4572-a74d-a85eec793325.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pkudzia","id":15024880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI0ODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15024880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia","html_url":"https://github.com/pkudzia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkudzia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
