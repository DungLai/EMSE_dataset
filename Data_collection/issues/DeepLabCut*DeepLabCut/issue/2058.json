I extracted outlier frames in Google Colab - however, as I need the GUI, I have downloaded my whole folder to my local machine to do the refine_labels. However, when I open the project and go to the refine_labels tab, despite having .h5 and .csv files in each folder, the frames do not show up and I get a traceback error in the console as detailed in the log. As well, if I try to go to the next image, I get:\r\n`IndexError: list index out of range`\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's any more information needed to try to solve this.\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 18.04\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version \n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nCPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/media/julia/Data/Julia/anaconda3/envs/DLC/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/gui/refinement.py\", line 404, in browseDir\r\n    self.img = os.path.join(self.project_path, self.index[self.iter])\r\n  File \"/media/julia/Data/Julia/anaconda3/envs/DLC/lib/python3.7/posixpath.py\", line 94, in join\r\n    genericpath._check_arg_types('join', a, *p)\r\n  File \"/media/julia/Data/Julia/anaconda3/envs/DLC/lib/python3.7/genericpath.py\", line 153, in _check_arg_types\r\n    (funcname, s.__class__.__name__)) from None\r\nTypeError: join() argument must be str or bytes, not 'tuple'\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"juliabandura","id":32461709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDYxNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32461709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura","html_url":"https://github.com/juliabandura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliabandura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2058/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
