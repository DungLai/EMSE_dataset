I input about 50 pairs of checkboard images and after iterating I get about 20 pairs that look good with correct corner detection. Here is a .zip of those images. However, after I run `deeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path, cbrow=8, cbcol=6, calibrate=False, alpha=0.9)`, `deeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path, cbrow=8, cbcol=6, calibrate=True, alpha=0.9)`, and then `deeplabcut.check_undistortion(config_path, cbrow=8, cbcol=6)`. Half of the images in the undistort folder are black, and the undistort looks incorrect. (.zip attached). \r\n[undistortion.zip](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/6051844/undistortion.zip)\r\n[corners.zip](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/6051846/corners.zip)\r\n[calibration_images.zip](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/6051848/calibration_images.zip)\r\n\r\nIf i continue onwards and run `deeplabcut.triangulate(config_path, '/home/jwang91/DeepLabCut/3dvideos', filterpredictions=False, videotype=\"mp4\")`, the following error is returned.\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-9-2185cd04233c> in <module>\r\n----> 1 deeplabcut.triangulate(config_path, '/home/jwang91/DeepLabCut/3dvideos', filterpredictions=False, videotype=\"mp4\")\r\n\r\n~/.conda/envs/deeplabcut/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_3d/triangulation.py in triangulate(config, video_path, videotype, filterpredictions, filtertype, gputouse, destfolder, save_as_csv)\r\n    212             #undistort points for this pair\r\n    213             print(\"Undistorting...\")\r\n--> 214             dataFrame_camera1_undistort,dataFrame_camera2_undistort,stereomatrix,path_stereo_file = undistort_points(config,dataname,str(cam_names[0]+'-'+cam_names[1]),destfolder)\r\n    215             if len(dataFrame_camera1_undistort) != len(dataFrame_camera2_undistort):\r\n    216                 import warnings\r\n\r\n~/.conda/envs/deeplabcut/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_3d/triangulation.py in undistort_points(config, dataframe, camera_pair, destfolder)\r\n    314     if True:\r\n    315         # Create an empty dataFrame to store the undistorted 2d coordinates and likelihood\r\n--> 316         dataframe_cam1 = pd.read_hdf(dataframe[0])\r\n    317         dataframe_cam2 = pd.read_hdf(dataframe[1])\r\n    318         scorer_cam1 = dataframe_cam1.columns.get_level_values(0)[0]\r\n\r\nIndexError: list index out of range\r\n\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.import dlc\r\n2.create 3d project\r\n3.move images into calibration_images folder\r\n4.run calibrate_cameras(calibrate=False)\r\n5.run calibrate_cameras(calibrate=True)\r\n6.run check_undistort\r\n7.see incorrect undistort folder\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any help or insight someone could provide for this!
