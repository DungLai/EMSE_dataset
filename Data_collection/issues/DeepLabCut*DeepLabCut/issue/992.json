I've tried running the testscript.py, but when it prints 'create video' (line 185 in testscript.py I think), it enters an infinite loop of error messsages (the lines between 'Imported DLC' and 'Type Error' will be repeated), and from the printed output, it appears it's jumping back to the beginning of the script? This repeats unless ctrl-c is pressed. I've tried to git clone and reinstall a couple of times, but keep getting this issue.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\nInitializing ResNet\r\nStarting to analyze %  C:\\Users\\jn18421\\DeepLabCut\\examples\\TEST-Alex-2020-11-11\\videos\\reachingvideo1short.avi\r\nC:\\Users\\jn18421\\DeepLabCut\\examples\\TEST-Alex-2020-11-11\\videos  already exists!\r\nThe videos are analyzed.
