The training worked great but now I would like to analyze my videos. This seems to work as well. DLC takes ~ 4-6 min to analyze my video. however, no csv nor h5 file is shown in the output folder. Which is why I canâ€™t create a video then. Additional info: I do a single animal analysis (so not maDLC).\r\n\r\nPlease place code inside this:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\n[Using snapshot-1030000 for model /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/OF_Masterthesis-DJ-2021-06-24/dlc-models/iteration-0/OF_MasterthesisJun24-trainset95shuffle1\r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.274915: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1733] Found device 0 with properties: \r\npciBusID: 0000:1a:00.0 name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti computeCapability: 7.5\r\ncoreClock: 1.545GHz coreCount: 68 deviceMemorySize: 10.76GiB deviceMemoryBandwidth: 573.69GiB/s\r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.276899: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1871] Adding visible gpu devices: 0\r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.277009: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1258] Device interconnect StreamExecutor with strength 1 edge matrix:\r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.277026: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1264]      0 \r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.277051: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1277] 0:   N \r\n2021-07-02 15:22:13.278236: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1418] Created TensorFlow device (/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 2934 MB memory) -> physical GPU (device: 0, name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, pci bus id: 0000:1a:00.0, compute capability: 7.5)\r\nStarting to analyze %  /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped/OF_08W_2577_WTcropped.mpg\r\n/home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped  already exists!\r\nLoading  /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped/OF_08W_2577_WTcropped.mpg\r\nDuration of video [s]:  304.92 , recorded with  25.0 fps!\r\nOverall # of frames:  7623  found with (before cropping) frame dimensions:  706 722\r\nStarting to extract posture\r\n7676it [02:57, 43.04it/s]                                                                                                                                                                     Starting to analyze %  /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped/OF_40W_2484_WTcropped.mpg\r\n/home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped  already exists!\r\nLoading  /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped/OF_40W_2484_WTcropped.mpg\r\nDuration of video [s]:  306.8 , recorded with  25.0 fps!\r\nOverall # of frames:  7670  found with (before cropping) frame dimensions:  730 740\r\nStarting to extract posture\r\n7676it [03:09, 40.51it/s]\r\nSaving results in /home/djenderny/DLC/OF/male/WT/cropped...                                                                                                                                   \r\nSaving csv poses!\r\n7676it [06:08, 20.83it/s]\r\nThe videos are analyzed.
