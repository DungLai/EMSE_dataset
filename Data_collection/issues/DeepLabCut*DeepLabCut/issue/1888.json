Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\n[Section H of the DLC user guide](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/standardDeepLabCut_UserGuide.html#h-evaluate-the-trained-network) says: \"Note that by default the human labels are plotted as plus (‘+’), DeepLabCut’s predictions either as ‘.’ (for confident predictions with likelihood > p-cutoff) and ’x’ for (likelihood <= pcutoff).\" \r\n\r\nBut it seems that both my labels and DLC's predictions are plotted as ('+'). \r\n![Example image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4753005/175133560-f4e9c110-e2d5-4dad-930b-c8902f92642a.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbunutu 20.04.4
