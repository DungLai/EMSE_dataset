For now, Windows users should avoid using the ``adjust labels`` section. **This is working properly on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS systems!**\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. in an environment,`` ipython``, ``import deeplabcut``, set path_config, and run ``deeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config).``\r\n2. Click on \"adjust label size\"\r\n3. Now the user cannot adjust the position of the label. \r\n4. No error is reported. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThat after adjust marker size - which should only be allowed ONCE on the first frame - the labels can be moved by a LEFT click+drag.
