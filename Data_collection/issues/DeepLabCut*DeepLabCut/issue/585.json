want to understand, how DeepLabCut works under the hood.\r\n\r\nI have read the corresponding papers and tried to understand the code, but I have one question which might be easy to answer for you:\r\n\r\nin train.py the training loop looks like this:\r\n` for it in range(max_iter+1):`\r\n\r\nIs the it (count of iterations) in this case counting the batches, which are used for training or is it counting epochs of data (with epoch = all batches are passed).\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood, the weight updates take place after each batch, is this right?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\nJan","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
