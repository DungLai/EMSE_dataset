The sizes of these videos are all 1G-3G. In training, I used kmeans to extract 40 frames for each video, that is, a total of 240 frames were used for training, training until the LOSS was 0.002. The remaining parameters are default parameters. Using the network this time to track my animal behavior videos, the results obtained are not perfect, but accurate enough.\r\n\r\nThis is the result obtained after evaluating_network.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"952\" alt=\"8b4bfe3eff76b8296438fd890f11afc\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/107141060-50023c00-6961-11eb-9aff-ffda580dd958.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever, when I tried to train the network for the second time, I replaced the original video with 8 videos with an average of 4 minutes and shot from four different angles. The size of these videos is 300M. In training, I still use kmeans to extract 40 frames for each video, that is, a total of 320 frames are used for training, and training until the LOSS is 0.002 (that is, repeat the steps of the first training). However, the visual tracking results of this network are very poor, with almost no accurate tracking points.\r\n\r\nAlso attach the results obtained after evaluating_network.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"759\" alt=\"7f1ecd70d7d8c024ba63ca208d24db1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/107141070-5ee8ee80-6961-11eb-8c35-c8c20fd9e72d.png\">\r\n\r\nThe error of the test is very large, but I am not sure why.\r\n\r\nI am a novice, and I have not been able to get the reason for the huge gap between the two training results. Is it related to the  format and size of the video? So I want to ask questions here to get answers that can help me! thank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
