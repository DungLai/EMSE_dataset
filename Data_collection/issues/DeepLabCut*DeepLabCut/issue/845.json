Go to \"Step 7. Analyze Videos\"\r\n2. For \"Want to save result(s) to csv?\", select \"no\"\r\n3. For \"Want to filter the predictions?\", select \"yes\"\r\n\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe \"analyze videos\" step is has options to 1) save the results as a csv and 2) to filter the predictions. When save as csv is false and filter the predictions is true (see screenshot), the following files are saved:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo_k_filtered.csv\r\nfoo_k_filtered.h5\r\nfoo_k.h5\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that _only_ h5 files would be saved (ie the save results to csv boolean should apply to both filtered and unfiltered data, but this does not seem to be the logic that is implemented.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![dlc_analyze_videos_bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372147/89851086-8856c800-db40-11ea-8884-a63e7c6daf9e.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
