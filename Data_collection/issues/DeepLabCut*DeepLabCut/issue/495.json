The bottom views are then flipped along the horizontal axis to make it seem that the camera is below the platform.  \r\n\r\nI used images of a checkerboard taken the same way for calibration.  All the corners for both views are correctly detected assigned, but when I run the check_undistortion, it seems to map the points off of the images somewhere in 3D-space (most of the mapped images are just black).  The locations of the checkerboard in the 3D plot don't move in the x-axis, which is how I moved it in the calibration pictures.\r\n\r\nIs this because the 2nd \"camera\" is looking from the bottom (or is from a reflection?).  Are there restrictions to where the cameras can be placed in relation to each other or some way to tell deeplabcut that the image is from below?\r\n\r\nI've attached a couple of the corners images and 3D plot.  Let me know if I'm not being clear with this.  Thanks for your help\r\n\r\nThong\r\n\r\n![checkerboard_3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57957737/69168127-17f4ac00-0ac4-11ea-976f-868f7ca7690e.png)\r\n\r\n![camera-1-06_corner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57957737/69168171-30fd5d00-0ac4-11ea-9a01-1c32ba70c4f0.jpg)\r\n\r\n![camera-2-06_corner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57957737/69168189-3a86c500-0ac4-11ea-8cfb-7078ede8193c.jpg)\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.
