Let say I am not familiar at all with Xeon and multicore stuff. I saw in (Mathis&Warren, 2018), the team is using this exact processor. I thought I am in the best condition to work, in term of hardware !\r\n\r\n**My problem:** When I started to use DLC multi-position, The GUI starts to struggle with only 6 animals and 6 body parts each. Like  quite slow. Compare to regular One animal annotation. Learning step is GREAT! But... Then when it comes to correct and refine Tracklets, the GUI is struggling a lot to refresh and so slow to process it is impossible de do anything at this step.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I tried to run some Matlab codes which runs perfectly on other kind of CPU (not multicores), even on laptop and here it is **so slow**.\r\n\r\nAltogether seems to point this specific CPU: Intel Xeon Bronze 3104\r\n\r\nDo you know if there is something specific I have to do to use properly this kind of CPU?\r\n\r\nThank a lot for your help.\r\n\r\nRaphael","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
