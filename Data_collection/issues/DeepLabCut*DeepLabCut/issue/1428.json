When I run testscript.py, as described in the tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s) immediately after installing DLC and then activating the conda environment, the execution of the program seems to throw multiple exceptions and errors which do not appear in the video. A lot of the data and messages about training the network also do not appear for me. Not sure why. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-20 at 4 23 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37655744/126407757-66c9a5bc-47a6-401c-9a3e-ebc600cf2b54.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-20 at 4 22 40 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37655744/126407759-660d7766-d3ae-4219-90fe-849bd01ca57b.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAlso had some interesting, potential \"error\", messages thrown during the installation of the conda environment from the .yaml file (i.e. when executing conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml). Not sure if this is relevant.
