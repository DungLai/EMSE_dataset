So far so good. However, afterwards ctrl +c will always paste the labels copied from the first use of ctrl+c. Additionally, ctrl+v does not seem to do anything.\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\n![221018_issue_DLC_labeling_frames_ctrl+c_use_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97124047/196453311-5292b6f7-aebf-4731-9a2a-31ca8742be73.png)\r\n![221018_issue_DLC_labeling_frames_ctrl+c_use_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97124047/196453325-f632e3ee-f1dd-4592-b1d4-e21d40427bde.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nDLC 2.2.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nCPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11370H @ 3.30GHz   3.30 GHz\r\nGPU: none used\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.
