And mentions of future tooling. But my question is related to labeling multiple animals using existing tools. I was wondering if you had any advice. \r\n\r\nI am trying to label aerial data of multiple sharks in ocean waters. Let's say for example there are 5 sharks in an image. Using existing tools, I could label a single shark and ignore the others in the image. Or, I could copy that image 5 times and then label a different shark in each of 5 duplicate images. Do you have any thoughts on which would be more effective? Or maybe there are other strategies I haven't considered.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThis a frame from one of the clearer video segments. The tagging results are a work in progress.\r\n![Training-agg3-img090](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5142129/69921432-761b7a80-1446-11ea-9ea3-eeca37af2139.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/509/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
