The training for OF was done in Multianimal mode, because I want to track the animal and capture the corner points of the open field at the same time. \r\n\r\nDuring the analysis I found out that not only one mouse is detected, but automatically indiv.1 and indiv.2 are captured (color difference of the tracking points) although I have only one mouse in the openfield. \r\n\r\nThe GUI also says \"number of animals\" = 2, probably because I am in multianimal mode. Can I still use the trained multianimal model, or does this no longer work?\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create multi animal project\r\n2. label mouse and open field (only one indiv.)\r\n3. train model\r\n4. analyse video (ellipse)\r\n5. refine tracklets\r\n6. --> got tracklets for 2 mice instead of 1 (see folowing pictures)\r\n\r\n![multianimal1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121997676-03b18780-cdab-11eb-8fa0-f2d6546fe1e2.jpg)\r\n![multianimal2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121997680-044a1e00-cdab-11eb-9327-6facd44fae20.jpg)\r\n\r\nwhat do you suggest when it comes to analyzing Elevated Plus maze and open field videos. Is a single or multianimal project preferable?\r\n\r\nThanks for helping\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
