I have Python version 3.6.10 and am using the dlc-windowsCPU environment recently downloaded from your website.  However, every time I try to import deeplabcut in ipython I get an import error saying that it cannot import name 'ft2font' as stated in the title.  I'm fairly new to programming although I have managed to install an older version of deeplabcut on another computer that lacked the memory required to train the network but I can't figure out what's going on with this one.  Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thank you in advance for your time.  I'll attach a screenshot of the problem.   \r\n\r\n\r\n![dlc error screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60626765/73762186-74677f00-4735-11ea-81cf-d4e9dd4b37ee.PNG)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/576/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
