Instead, the individuals are named (default) ind1 through indN.  Unfortunately the individuals in my original labelled set of iteration 0 are called m1 ... mN. After refining the labels this results in a CollectedData file with additional individual names. \r\n\r\nWhen creating the training set this leads to the creation of additional individual names, and hence too many individuals when evaluating the network causing evaluate_network to crash. \r\n\r\nRenaming the individuals in the data that was added in iteration1 using: `df.rename(level=1, columns={\"ind1\": \"m1\", \"ind2\": \"m2\", \"ind3\": \"m3\", \"ind4\": \"m4\", \"ind5\": \"m5\"})` for all added videos solves this issue.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the machinelabels could be genrated using the individual names from the config. \n\n### Operating System\n\noperating system: Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version: 2.2.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu Titan RTX\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThanks :)\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
