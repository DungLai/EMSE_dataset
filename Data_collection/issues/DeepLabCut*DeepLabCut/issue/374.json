When I refine labels and then save and go to check my labels, certain frames do not appear to be updating. About 85% of them save as expected, but the remaining 15% do not save with the refinements I made. Some of these frames appear to be labeled identically to the labels I placed on other frames from a different video in the training dataset, as shown in the images below. I'm uncertain how to reproduce the problem, as it only happens about 15% of the time but it interferes with performance.  \r\n\r\n![img002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37850800/61747803-85314400-ad53-11e9-8303-bdbbe8267b1d.png)\r\nThis frame is clearly labeled as I have labeled a different frame. I have refined the labels on this particular frame, saved it, and gone to check the labels and it still has not updated, whereas others I refined have updated, as shown in the following image (from the same video). This problem has persisted for several particular frames across several iterations of this project.\r\n![img007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37850800/61747852-af830180-ad53-11e9-88d2-456c480433c2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
