This error (see screenshot) appears when I want to create a new training dataset with these refinements.\r\nI tried to search the cause of this error but I am stuck. From what I have search, it appears that the folder \"iteration-1\" is created in the \"training-datasets\", with the files .csv and h5 files but the matlab file can't be created.\r\nAlso I think (correct me if I am wrong) that the initial and refined frames are merged since there is 16 frames per videos and the initial labelling is 8.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior: (not sure that this will reproduce the error though because I did the same thing for other model refinements and all were okay)\r\n1. Outliers extraction\r\n2. Refinement\r\n3. Dataset merged\r\n4. New training set creation with mobilnet_v2_1.0, imgaug augmentation method\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![trainset_creation2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22397038/79611532-cc711900-80c8-11ea-9187-1b9237b0e6ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"EliaFe","id":22397038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk3MDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22397038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe","html_url":"https://github.com/EliaFe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliaFe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
