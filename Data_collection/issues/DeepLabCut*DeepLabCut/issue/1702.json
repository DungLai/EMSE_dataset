This problem occurs regardless of whether the command is run from iPython or a script. If the command is run from iPython, it also kills iPython. I receive slightly different errors when running in iPython vs as a python script. The error included under `relevant log output` is produced by the script, and the error under `additional information` is from running in iPython. Interestingly, this always occurs exactly 92% of the way into creating the video.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the root error is about the numpy index being out of bounds.\n\n### Operating System\n\noperating system RHEL8 (on my University HPC cluster)\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu NVIDIA A-100\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn a DeepLabCut Conda environment (no gui support):\r\n```python\r\nimport deeplabcut as dlc\r\nconfig_path = \"/path/to/config.yaml\"\r\ndlc.create_labelled_video(config_path, ['/path/to/video.avi'])\r\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\"\"\"\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 125, in worker\r\n    result = (True, func(*args, **kwds))\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 48, in mapstar\r\n    return list(map(*args))\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils/make_labeled_video.py\", line 671, in proc_video\r\n    CreateVideo(\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils/make_labeled_video.py\", line 177, in CreateVideo\r\n    clip.save_frame(image)\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils/video_processor.py\", line 149, in save_frame\r\n    self.svid.write(np.flip(frame, 2))\r\n  File \"<__array_function__ internals>\", line 5, in flip\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/lib/function_base.py\", line 236, in flip\r\n    axis = _nx.normalize_axis_tuple(axis, m.ndim)\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/numeric.py\", line 1385, in normalize_axis_tuple\r\n    axis = tuple([normalize_axis_index(ax, ndim, argname) for ax in axis])\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/numeric.py\", line 1385, in <listcomp>\r\n    axis = tuple([normalize_axis_index(ax, ndim, argname) for ax in axis])\r\nnumpy.AxisError: axis 2 is out of bounds for array of dimension 0\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"scripts/evaluate.py\", line 33, in <module>\r\n    dlc.create_labeled_video(\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils/make_labeled_video.py\", line 518, in create_labeled_video\r\n    pool.map(func, Videos)\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 364, in map\r\n    return self._map_async(func, iterable, mapstar, chunksize).get()\r\n  File \"/home/rbp33/.conda/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 771, in get\r\n    raise self._value\r\nnumpy.AxisError: axis 2 is out of bounds for array of dimension 0\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI think this is likely related to #1698, but I opened a new error since I can't run this command at all. It seems to independent of any options passed. I've tried with various combinations of `trailingpoints`, `draw_skeleton`, `save_frames`, `filtered`, and others, all producing the same error.\r\n\r\nThe iPython error is below.
