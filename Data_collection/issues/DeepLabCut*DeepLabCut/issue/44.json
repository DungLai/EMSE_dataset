Follow the instructions for training on the website, using tensorflow vsn. 1.10\r\n2. Run the \"train.py\" script\r\n4. Observe error about \"False\" not being a legal value for scale.\r\n\r\n**To Fix**\r\n(Sorry, I could have created a pull request, but I didn't want to clone the whole project just for one trivial bug.)\r\nReplace code\r\n        vers = tf.__version__\r\n        if float(vers[0:3]) < 1.4:\r\n(line 51 and 52 in pose-tensorflow/nnet/pose_net.py)\r\nwith something like\r\n        vers = tf.__version__\r\n        vers = vers.split(\".\")\r\n        if float(vers[0]) < 1 or (float(vers[0])==1 and float(vers[1])<10):\r\nThanks for great code.
