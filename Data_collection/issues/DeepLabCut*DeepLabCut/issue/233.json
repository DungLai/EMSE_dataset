But running on Docker (https://github.com/eqs/DeepLabCut-Docker/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) which installs Ubuntu 16.04 with cuda9.0.\r\n\r\nI have two GPUs installed. 1080ti on GPU0 and 1080 on GPU1\r\n \r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nwhen running `analyze_videos` with `gputouse` to be 0, it should only utilize GPU0, but it seems like somehow allocate _all_ available GPUs to analyze. And annoyingly it does not seem to improve the speed either.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. After training done, run `dlc.analyze_videos(config_path, [video_path], gputouse=0, destfolder=dest_dir).\r\n2. run nvidia-smi on your cmd and watch how memory is being allocated.\r\n3. Both GPU somehow occupy all memory \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOnly 1 GPU should be used\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![nvidia-smi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23262857/53841463-77288580-3f62-11e9-9229-dafd92aa336f.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
