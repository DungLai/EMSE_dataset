After creating and training a single animal project with the latest DLC version, I find that there is no longer an option to refine tracklets in the GUI bar at the top (the button is missing). Did I enter something incorrectly when creating the project? \r\n\r\nI want to track a mouse in the Open Field and therefore used single animal, because with multi animal I get a tracking with gaps as output (due to incorrect stitching).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Created single animal project in DLC 2.2rc2\r\n2. labeled videos with point of interest\r\n3. trained with 1030000 iterations\r\n4. analyzed video\r\n5. created labeled video\r\n6. wanted to refine tracklets\r\n7. --> no GUI-button for refinement of tracklets, \r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![no refinement button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/123043054-0558fc00-d3f8-11eb-9992-bf9274427e74.jpg)\r\n\r\nI also get an error when using python code in anaconda:\r\n![anaconda error refinement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/123044059-7947d400-d3f9-11eb-8990-fd456d59dbe6.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, there should be no \"individuals\" in the header of the single analysis in the pickle file / CSV.","closed_by":{"login":"DaBue93","id":66160679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTYwNjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66160679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93","html_url":"https://github.com/DaBue93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaBue93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
