This is a very small shifting, but yet important for the accuracy of the training. \r\n\r\n(my operating system and dlc version:) Windows 10, Anaconda 3 Env (GPU) & DeepLabCut 2.2b6\r\n\r\nAttached are some screenshots of the same labeled frame with the noticeable shifting:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59688604/90330993-03453600-dfba-11ea-8fe5-41426b27fe74.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59688604/90330995-05a79000-dfba-11ea-9ce1-179a5994bb53.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/854/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
