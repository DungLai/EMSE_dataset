So far so good. \r\n\r\nI'm now facing issues during the analysis of the videos on Colab. Each video is 20 min long, 45 fps, ~3,5 gb. \r\nThe analysis is interrupted in the middle of the process (~50/60%), so usually after ~2 or 3 hours. \r\nNo message appears (GPU limitation usage or else). It just disconnects and stops there (and I have no warning message to ask me if I'm still there, if I'm a robot..)\r\n\r\nAt this point I would have 2 questions: \r\n- Is there a way to resume the analysis without restarting from scratch in order to don't loose what have already been analyzed? \r\n- What could I do to avoid such interruptions?  \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nBest, \r\nDorian ","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
