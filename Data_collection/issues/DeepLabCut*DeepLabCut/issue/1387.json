I am trying to set up experiment using DeepLabCut.\r\nYour papers are very helpful in analyzing animal behavior.\r\nI get information about spec of GPU, RAM and graphic card at paper. \r\nHowever, I don't know spec of CPU, SSD and etc. \r\nWhen I trained data set at my computer, it took too much time. \r\n\r\nThe computer specs used are as follows:\r\ndevice name: DESKTOP-68KTCDG\r\nprocessor: Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2234 CPU 3.60GHz\r\nRAM: 128GB\r\nGraphic card: GeForce GTX 1660 super\r\n\r\nThe video properties used are as follows:\r\nvideo length: 00:20:09\r\nframe width: 1920\r\nframe height: 1080\r\ndata rate: 14034kbps\r\ntotal bit rate: 14229kbps\r\nframe rate: 23.69 frame/s\r\n\r\nI want to know spec of CPU, SSD and etc. \r\nI hope you answer this question.\r\nThank you for reading this question.
