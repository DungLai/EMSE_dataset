Analyze na√Øve videos \r\n3.)I determined the network had to be further trained\r\n4.) extract_outlier_frames\r\n5.) refine_labels\r\n6.) merge_dataset\r\n7.) create_new_training\r\n8.) train_network \r\n\r\nWhat should the new proper function order be to ensure proper training of an i-generation dataset? I tried using add_new_videos (specifically the videos that I am extracting outlier frames for) before running the i generation of training.  This adds video paths to the actual config file, which was not something that was needed in previous versions. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it used to be that on the ith generation of training, the number of iterations was not 100*i, but instead, just 100, and the function understood that this meant 100 more. Additionally, this method now does not merge the training sets, but instead overwrites the existing one. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\n1050TI\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
