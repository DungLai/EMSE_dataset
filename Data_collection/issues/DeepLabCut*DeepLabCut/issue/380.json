(Demo_labeledexample_MouseReaching)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior:**\r\n\r\n1. Go to Demo_labeledexample_MouseReaching notebook\r\n2. Run cell under \"## Manually correct labels\":\r\n```\r\n %gui wx\r\ndeeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config_file)\r\n```\r\n3. GUI pops up, Click on load labels, and load the correct .h5 file\r\n4. Check labels, modify/delete them. \r\n5. Click on save - No response (later on checking, no change is saved)\r\n6. Close the GUI window, repeat until steps 5 again. \r\n7. Close the GUI window, and notice that JNotebook cell is still running (* mark next to it) Interrupting the kernel doesn't seem to stop the widget either. \r\n8. Has to restart the kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttaching screen recording:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=12g6HvqkA9OZESVElsP_jYqKNJnb3IOF3\r\nThe part where the pointer is hovering the menu buttons (like save, zoom, etc, I'm left clicking but it is not responding)\r\n\r\nAny workarounds, since relabelling the part is a major step?\r\n\r\nThank you!
