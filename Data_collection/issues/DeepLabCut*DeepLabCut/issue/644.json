The latest release of moviepy (1.0.2), however, requires a version of NumPy greater than or equal to 1.17.3 (see [here](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/blob/master/setup.py#L75)).  This causes a dependency hell issue.  moviepy 1.0.1 does not mandate a specific version of numpy (see [here](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/blob/v1.0.1/setup.py#L70)).  Proposed fix would be to lock moviepy at version <= 1.0.1 in _setup.py_.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\n(foo) [jsp2205@ax08 ~]$ pip install deeplabcut\r\nCollecting deeplabcut\r\n...\r\nmoviepy 1.0.2 has requirement numpy>=1.17.3; python_version != \"2.7\", but you'll have numpy 1.16.4 which is incompatible.\r\nInstalling collected packages: proglog, numpy, imageio-ffmpeg, moviepy, intel-openmp, tabulate, msgpack-numpy, termcolor, tensorpack, opencv-python, Shapely, imgaug, ruamel.yaml.clib, ruamel.yaml, easydict, deeplabcut, mock\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
