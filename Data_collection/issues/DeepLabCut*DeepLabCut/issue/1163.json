Second, it tells \"Internal Error\" after GPU... (see 1st picture). However, the tests done in the second picture look fine for the GPU...\r\nDo you have any idea on what problem this is referring to ? I saw that a lot of people had this problem, but never found the solution for my case...\r\nThanks a lot in advance\r\n\r\nPlease place code inside this:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\nnvidia-smi\r\n\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379843/112515353-7d326e80-8d96-11eb-9520-496df296544b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379843/112519022-3fcfe000-8d9a-11eb-8c64-d37b32bfd59f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
