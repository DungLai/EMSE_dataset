Since I have the x, y coordinates of the labels from the .csv file in the /labeled-data/video-camera-2/ folder, I wanted to use those coordinates instead of relabeling my 15 body parts for 80 frames. The frames I would be labeling would be the same frames I originally labeled using the GUI so the coordinates stored in the CollectedData_Scorer.csv file will work.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to use these raw coordinates or should I go and relabel using the GUI...\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
