Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nIts like in this closed Issue descriped:\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/865\r\n\r\nI have two mice in my maDLC project and wanted to correct the itentities, as you explain in all your tutorials.\r\nBut after setting flags and doing Lasso around those bodyparts in a frame within the flagged period is just nothing happening while clicking on the identities in the legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81317771/142674344-83b5c467-b6dc-4c0f-86a4-ccdc0cc04d92.png)\r\nLike in the screenshot: Ive just set Flags, chosen a frame in between, done the lasso as suggested, but nothing happens, when i click on the legend for \"adult\" or the red bar next to it..\r\n\r\nThe Terminal just shows of an \"Attribute error\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81317771/142675627-347711e5-ea06-4b79-9200-d885956869d7.png)\r\n\r\nWhat can i do?\r\nIn the old you`ve recommented to try standard DLC, if possible, or wait for new DLC Version.\r\nActually i am currently using the newest version and dont know what to do now..\r\nWould be very nice if someone has a quick suggestion, bc i have to present results on monday :p \r\n\r\nThanks and all the best!\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nIm usung Ubuntu 18.04\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2.0.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti
