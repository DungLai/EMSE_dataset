But I thought it would be useful to others to write it here. Another workaround would be to mess with the python interpreter actually used within an environment with symlinks, but this is even more of a mess.\r\n\r\n**System:**\r\n - OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.6\r\n - Python version: 3.7.10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.10.2\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: single animal tracking\r\n - ran from command line (ipython)\r\n - wxPython version: 4.0.7.post2 (most recent version 4.1.1 was crashing with the bug [reported here](URL), had to pin the version)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n```\r\n$ ipython\r\n>>> import wx\r\n>>> wx.App()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error:**\r\n`SystemExit: This program needs access to the screen.
