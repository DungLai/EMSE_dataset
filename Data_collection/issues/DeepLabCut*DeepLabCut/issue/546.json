I check my nividia card state from both two ways as followed, it looks like the GPU is not used! \r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-27 16-48-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59871930/72344883-ace5e100-36d2-11ea-9dce-1e49fb402d38.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-13 10-08-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59871930/72344884-ad7e7780-36d2-11ea-8cc8-3cc93cec3040.png)\r\nSo what the problems would be?  am i following the right way to use docker-gpu? \r\nOne strange thing remind me is: when i using docker and run the DLC in the terminal step by step, everything seems to be fine in the docker enviroment, please see the red part as followed: \r\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-14 14-14-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59871930/72348225-3d73ef80-36da-11ea-906c-584f6da181ef.png)\r\nuntil i import DLC and using it to do the training, the directory change to the directory i run the DLC using conda enviroment with CPU?\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-14 14-20-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59871930/72348691-38fc0680-36db-11ea-9ce9-95e2e6934602.png)\r\nsomthing wrong here? is it related with the issue that the GPU is not used? \r\n\r\nAnd another question, i wonder if the GPU  not being used for DLC is because the my graphic card is too old? If yes, does it works with replacing the graphic card? or a totally new and better computer? \r\nReally thank you for the helpful suggestions!! \r\nGreetings, \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
