Go to 'Demo_yourowndata'\r\n2. run cells in this order: \r\nIn [1]: 'import deeplabcut'\r\nIn [2]: task='Reaching',  experimenter='Mackenzie', video=['videos/vid1.avi', 'videos/vid2.avi'] \r\n\tpath_config_file=deeplabcut.create_new_project(task,experimenter,video,copy_videos=True) \r\nIn [3]: %matplotlib inline\r\n\tdeeplabcut.extract_frames(path_config_file) \r\nIn [*]: %gui wx\r\n\tdeeplabcut.label_frames(path_config_file)\r\n3. Use the GUI to label frames\r\n4. click SAVE, \r\n5. click QUIT.\r\n6. Do you want to label another dataset: No    \r\n7. At this point I got no error message but I can't run the next cell \r\nif I try I see: \r\nIn [*]: %gui wx\r\n\tdeeplabcut.label_frames(path_config_file)\r\nIn [*]: deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file)\r\nboth cells seems busy,... but nothing happen. \r\n\r\nIn that case I really don't know what to do since I have no error message and things seems to works well, \r\nexcept that I am stuck every time I quit the GUI. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and let me know if you have ideas that could help me to solve this issue.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/903/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
