I am trying to analyze a total of 95 5-10 minute long videos. I figured I would randomly select 10 of them, extract 20 frames from each, and label these 200 frames to then apply to the rest. I was able to extract frames and label the first ten videos but ran into trouble when trying to add the other 85 videos prior to creating the training dataset. I loaded the project in the GUI by selecting the config file with no problem and could press the \"Load New Videos\" button to select he other 85 videos. However, when I press \"Add New Videos,\" I receive the following error:\r\n![DLC symbolic link privilege error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73397911/115590416-8b40b580-a296-11eb-9040-8645402c5527.png)\r\nI've tried this on two separate computers (one is a personal computer with no admin blocks and one is an admin run system) and I have had the same issue both times. I was wondering if there was something I'm doing incorrectly or if there's a way to mass add the videos through the terminal that I'm missing. I'd also love to know of there's an easier way to only extract frames from and label a portion of the videos besides this or using the manual \"need user feedback\" button on the extract frames tab of the GUI (kind of a pain to type yes or no 95 times).
