The image however stays the same as frame 0.\r\nReadjusting the labels on frame 0 and moving to frame 1 and back to 0 resets the position to the last frame of the package.\r\nWhat solved it was opening the frame-package, adjusting frame 0, saving and quitting without moving to other frames.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open relable GUI, open frame-package\r\n2. Adjust labels for frame 0\r\n3. Move to frame 1 and back to 0\r\n4. see the labels are the same as last frame\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLabels shouldn't move on their own.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: win10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.1.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
