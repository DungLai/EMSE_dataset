The new maDLC is quite amazing, more accurate, more network choices. Fantastic work team! I did encounter one challenge when using it, hence this feature request.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn the beta version of maDLC, one could name the individuals in the config file as pleased. This would then be used as the individual names in the h5 file and would lead to no issues when creating a labelled video.\r\n\r\nIn the new version of maDLC, the stitch_tracklets method by default assigns ids as [ind1,ind2,...]. Then when trying to create a labelled video nothing is displayed as the individuals names in the h5 file and config files do not match and thus the list 'individuals' (which comes from individuals = auxfun_multianimal.IntersectionofIndividualsandOnesGivenbyUser(cfg,displayedindividuals)) becomes empty. Thus when slicing the dataframe from the h5 file, this also becomes empty and nothing is plotted on the frames.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally, by default the stitch_tracklets function should just take the individuals names from the config file. Not sure if this was implemented on purpose this way, but at least for me, it caused some confusion and would be nice if it can be avoided.\r\nIf necessary I can make a pull request to ease your workload.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPerhaps in the maDLC userguide you could emphasize that if custom names are used (instead of ind_i) then these should also be specified when stitching tracklets.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1236/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
