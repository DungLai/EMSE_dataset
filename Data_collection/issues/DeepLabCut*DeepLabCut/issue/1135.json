The final error is a 'FileNotFoundError' for the 'm3v1mp4shortDLC_resnet_50_multi_mouseMar5shuffle1_5_full.pickle' file in the videos directory of the multi_mouse directory created by the testscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - OS: Mac Catalina (10.15)\r\n - Anaconda environment DLC-CPU\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.10.2 \r\n            > ***This is also part of my question though (and might provide a quick answer to the 'bug'), so I will elaborate briefly here. I was previously using version 2.2b8 and achieving successful testscript_multianimal testing. However, in a recent query to the forum on dealing with variable numbers of animals across different videos/experiments (https://forum.image.sc/t/training-variable-number-of-animals-in-multi-animal/38374), I was advised that v2.2b8 was no longer supported and to use v2.1.10.2 instead; and that in v2.1.10.2, multianimal tracking was now supported. Is this true? If so, then I need to solve this error that I am getting with the testscript. But if not, and if I am supposed to be using v2.2b8, then I do not have this error.***\r\n - DeepLabCut mode = multi-animal tracking\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Activate DLC-CPU\r\n2.
