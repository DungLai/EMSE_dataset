However, as of the morning of 01 October, when restarting the runtime after executing the above command, the Runtime refuses to reconnect and repeatedly crashes. I've encountered the same issue with the notebooks available on this GitHub namely 'latest_Colab_TrainNetwork_VideoAnalysis' and 'Colab_DEMO_mouse_openfield'.\r\n\r\nA standout warning (now noticed in the context of this error) was the below message that is printed out after executing the above command:\r\n\r\n\"WARNING: Upgrading ipython, ipykernel, tornado, prompt-toolkit or pyzmq can\r\ncause your runtime to repeatedly crash or behave in unexpected ways and is not\r\nrecommended. If your runtime won't connect or execute code, you can reset it\r\nwith \"Reset all runtimes...\" from the \"Runtime\" menu.\"\r\n\r\nI've noted that the logging prints out the following snippet:\r\n\r\n\"Building wheels for collected packages: pyyaml\r\n  Building wheel for pyyaml (setup.py) ... done\r\n  Created wheel for pyyaml: filename=PyYAML-5.1.2-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl size=44104 sha256=56f41498a76bb84a397f714fc0617a016f8eec9363b0307a6cdbd453e8facf04\r\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/d9/45/dd/65f0b38450c47cf7e5312883deb97d065e030c5cca0a365030\r\nSuccessfully built pyyaml\r\n....\r\nERROR: google-colab 1.0.0 has requirement ipython~=5.5.0, but you'll have ipython 6.0.0 which is incompatible.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot recall if the warning message was present before I encountered these difficulties, but perhaps it has something to do with the ipython package.
