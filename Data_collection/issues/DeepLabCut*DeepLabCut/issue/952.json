Please fill out the template completely, including the full \"traceback\" and input code that you ran to hit this error.\r\n\r\n**Your Operating system and DeepLabCut version**\r\n\r\nI was using Google Colab to run model training and video analysis of a multianimal DLC project. And I used DLC version 2.2b7.\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\n\r\nI was training and testing a maDLC model with an unique body-part. But the unique body-part was not predicted for testing videos. And I have checked the compiled training set. The data of unique body-part was good.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeeplabcut.create_multianimaltraining_dataset(path_config_file, windows2linux=True)\r\nshuffle = 1\r\ndeeplabcut.train_network(path_config_file, shuffle=shuffle, displayiters=1000,saveiters=4000)\r\nvideofile_path = ['/content/drive/My Drive/test.mp4'] \r\nscorername = deeplabcut.analyze_videos(path_config_file, \r\n                                       videofile_path, \r\n                                       shuffle=1, \r\n                                       videotype=VideoType, \r\n                                       c_engine=False)\r\ntracktype= 'skeleton' \r\ndeeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(path_config_file, Specific_videofile, videotype=VideoType,\r\n                                                    shuffle=1, track_method=tracktype, overwrite=True)\r\ndeeplabcut.convert_raw_tracks_to_h5(path_config_file, picklefile)\r\ndeeplabcut.filterpredictions(path_config_file, \r\n                                 videofile_path, \r\n                                 videotype='mp4', \r\n                                 track_method = 'skeleton')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got no error message. And I could generate labeled videos from results, but videos were without labels of the unique body-part.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run the above code\r\n2. Check resultant csv files of testing videos (and to check csv file of compiled training set to make sure dataset creation is good).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nConfig file: (just want to make sure the format is correct)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55998514/95656694-081bf700-0ade-11eb-88a2-4c41ba733c6f.png)\r\n\r\nUnique bodypart column in compiled training set (the unique bp is called implant):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55998514/95656739-57622780-0ade-11eb-8556-797d43106e44.png)\r\n\r\nUnique bodypart column in csv file of a testing video:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55998514/95656778-998b6900-0ade-11eb-9fb3-62e67bf7b7df.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/952/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
