I've already analyzed the video and converted it to tracklets. On the Refine Tracklets tab, I loaded the config file, original video, and the bx.pickle file(tracklet data), and I click on 'Step 1: Launch GUI,' I get the following error: \"value error: all arrays must be the same length\"\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\n1. In anaconda prompt: \r\ncd [...] \r\nconda activate dlc-gpu\r\nipython\r\n\r\n2. In ipython: \r\nimport deeplabcut\r\ndeeplabcut.launch_dlc() \r\n\r\n3. In GUI, I load the config file, and then go to Refine Tracklets tab where I load the config file, original vidoe, and the tracklet data(bx.pickle)\r\n\r\n4. Set minswap=2, minrel=2, maxgap=2, trail length=0, viodetype=mp4, shuffle=1, trainingsetindex=0, filtertype:median, windowlength=5\r\n\r\n5. Click on 'Step 1: Launch GUI'\r\n\r\n6. See error \r\n\r\n**Prior to going to refine tracklets tab, all prior steps(tabs) were completed except for 'video editor'. \r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n![ValueError_ArrayLength](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71092304/94599944-32102680-025f-11eb-83bf-c0f5475ced74.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
