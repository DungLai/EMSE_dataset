Unfortunately this doesn't seem to solve the issue for me. I still get a segmentation fault and it is never on the same frame either. \n\n### Operating System\n\noperating system: Ubuntu 20.04.3\r\n\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version: 2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. In the deeplabcut environment, ipython\r\n2. import deeplabcut\r\n3. create a new multianimal project\r\n4. deeplabcut.extract_frames(config, mode='automatic', algo='kmeans', userfeedback=False)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nBLAS : Program is Terminated.
