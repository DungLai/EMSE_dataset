Please describe.**\r\nI have to frequently modify the pose_cfg.yaml and it's always struck me as odd that there isn't an auxiliary function for it.\r\n\r\nSeveral places in the deeplabcut code access the pose_cfg.yaml, each time they reconstruct it. Why not modularize it and make it more available to users?\r\n\r\ne.g. in [auxiliaryfunctions.py#L575-L580](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/444da3da70b1f3bfaae39b0849e0aafcff1a9b7a/deeplabcut/utils/auxiliaryfunctions.py#L575-L580)\r\n```python\r\nos.path.join(\r\n    cfg[\"project_path\"],\r\n    str(GetModelFolder(trainFraction, shuffle, cfg, modelprefix=modelprefix)),\r\n    \"train\",\r\n    \"pose_cfg.yaml\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA new function in `auxiliaryfunctions.py` to get the pose_cfg.yaml file (ideally with an intuitive name like get_pose_config)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have a snippet that does it, but I always lose it and have to go searching again. The frequency where its useful to change the pose_cfg makes me think others would benefit as well (eg. finding optimal augmentation parameters, changing learning rates, etc) \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSome places I've found mention of the `pose_cfg.yaml` file (some appear tidy, others less so):\r\n- https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/444da3da70b1f3bfaae39b0849e0aafcff1a9b7a/deeplabcut/utils/auxiliaryfunctions.py#L575-L580\r\n- https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/34eb7f6042322d1af98afb487dbfd13b617d276f/examples/testscript_mobilenets.py#L27-L39\r\n-  **Just found this, good solution?
