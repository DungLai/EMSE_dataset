I have followed the instructions to install all the required software for GPU support and have made sure that their versions are compatible with each other according to these tables: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows\r\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html.\r\n\r\nIt seems like DeepLabCut can find my GPU device (see attached) when I start the training but when I looked at task manager, Python is always using only 2.3-2.4% of the GPU and around 25-30% of CPU. I am wondering if this is normal. Also, it seems like my computer is taking ~17 secs to do 100 iterations (~9.4 hrs for 200,000 iterations). Is this speed slower than expected for RTX 3070?\r\n\r\n![tensorflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63482670/131052712-2a57662e-219f-4883-8bcb-8fb40d930a3b.PNG)\r\n![GPU usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63482670/131052718-caa8591e-d5cd-4dde-adfb-37e504d7e461.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\noperating system: Windows 10\r\nNVIDIA driver: 461.40\r\nCUDA: 11.2.2\r\ncudnn: 8.1.0.77\r\nTensorflow: 2.5.0\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\ndlc version 2.2.0.1\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nsingle animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\ngpu: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
