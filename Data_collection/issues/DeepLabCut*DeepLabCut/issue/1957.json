These snapshots had evaluated well, and during previous training had normal plateaued rates of loss hence being chosen as the point to train the next iteration from.\r\n\r\nI had considered that this could be a problem with correctly displaying information rather than a reflection of the true learning loss value but the model snapshots created during the training with very high loss evaluate very poorly, sometimes not producing any predictions above the pcutoff of 0.6.\r\n\r\nRestarting training can fix this problem but sometimes not, continuing to produce quite different but always much to high learning loss. In this case I have chosen the 2nd best performing snapshot and trained from that point without issue.\r\n\r\nThis issue does not seem to have prevented the training of well performing models generally and I have had no errors during my use of DLC otherwise.\n\n### Operating System\n\nwin 10 x64\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ncolab gpu/3080\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
