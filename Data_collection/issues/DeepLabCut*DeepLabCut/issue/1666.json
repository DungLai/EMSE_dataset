We have now acquired a nvidia geforce rtx 3070 and I've installed the new version (2.2.0.5) with cuda 11.2, tensorflow 2.7 and cudnn 8.2. \r\nI've also converted the old projects to this new version and everything seems to work fine but, it doesn't track more than 3-4 videos because the kernel suddenly dies without any error. I've tried running in a jupyter notebook, terminal and spyder, all with the same output. I imagine in google colab this won't happen because it seems a GPU problem but I can't seem to fix it.\r\nAny ideas?\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2.0.5\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu nvidia rtx 3070\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nThis TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX AVX2\r\nTo enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.\r\n2022-02-03 13:20:30.044700: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1525] Created device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 5468 MB memory:  -> device: 0, name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, pci bus id: 0000:21:00.0, compute capability: 8.6\r\n2022-02-03 13:20:35.196889: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:366] Loaded cuDNN version 8200\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1666/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
