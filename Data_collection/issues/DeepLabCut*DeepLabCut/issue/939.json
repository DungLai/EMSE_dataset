I have a question and would highly appreciate it if you could help me. According to the documentation, one should set all the parameters related to data augmentation before creating the dataset but I got a little lost about this specific one.\r\n\r\nThe parameter `mirror` is used exactly in which step of the training?\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is: If I set `mirror=True`, run `create_training_model_comparison()` and then set `mirror=False` before running `train_network()` will it run with or without mirror? I guess my question is if the data augmentation parameters have any influence on the step of `create_training_model_comparison`/`create_training_dataset` or if I can worry about them only when running `train_network()`.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
