The .h5 file is missing and there is no labeled data. \r\nI have got the CSV file in the folder with the coordinates labeled perfectly. I can thus also not train the neural network. \r\n\r\nI have tried multiple things - pip uninstall tables followed by pip install tables; conda uninstall pytables followed by conda install tables. However, I cannot seem to overcome this error. \r\n\r\nI also thought of separately converting the CSV file to the .h5 file using tables myself, but the same import error in tables persists in the DLC ipython terminal. \r\n\r\nI would be highly obliged if you could help me overcome this error. \n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2.0.5\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu RTX 3060\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.
