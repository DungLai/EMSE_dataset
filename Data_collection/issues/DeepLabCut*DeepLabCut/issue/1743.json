When I clicked Launch GUI and attempted to load the machinelabels h5 file I get the traceback shown below. I completed a clean install of both the code, and the environment neither of which rectified the issue. I also double checked that the config file pointed to the correct video and the labels are also in the correct place. I saw this error on other time on our GPU compute cluster but a fresh install fixed it there. The same DLC installation was used to extract the labels as we tried to use to refine them. \n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version: 2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nCPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Successfully Extract Outlier Frames\r\n2. Launch the Outlier Labeling GUI using LAUNCH GUI\r\n3. Select the machinelabels-iter0.h5 file in the appropriate labeled-data folder for our video\r\n4. Get the stack trace below and the program locks up\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n`Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\gui\\refinement.py\", line 395, in browseDir\r\n    self.Dataframe.sort_index(inplace=True)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\util\\_decorators.py\", line 311, in wrapper\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\frame.py\", line 6449, in sort_index\r\n    return super().sort_index(\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\generic.py\", line 4693, in sort_index\r\n    indexer = get_indexer_indexer(\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\sorting.py\", line 93, in get_indexer_indexer\r\n    indexer = nargsort(\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\dewanlab.PSY-PDB-C474-B\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\sorting.py\", line 411, in nargsort\r\n    indexer = non_nan_idx[non_nans.argsort(kind=kind)]\r\nTypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'tuple'`\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
