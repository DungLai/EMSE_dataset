(3rd screenshot)\r\nThe .csv and .h5 files exist in all the directories. It seems that the labels do exist but the function cannot read the files.\r\n\r\nHow can I fix this?","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/344/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
