I also tried uninstalling everything and reinstalling things several times but could not seem to fix the issues. I was able to make it work on an old Mac and I am wondering if there is something that I am missing here...\r\n\r\nSo far, the last things that I have retried are : \r\nredownloading DEEPLABCUT.yaml\r\n 'conda activate DEEPLABCUT'\r\n'pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.3rc1' - this command seems to work. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I type in: 'python -m deeplabcut', I get the following error message:\r\n\r\n zsh: illegal hardware instruction  python -m deeplabcutI googled it many times but could not find a way to solve it. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if anyone could help me fix it or suggest things to make it work. \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nJaz\r\n\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac OS Monterey 12.5.1 (M2 chip)\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nrc\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
