I have seen `Kmeans clustering ... (this might take a while)` for over an hour now, on an 8-core Intel i7-9800X X-series processor. All 16 threads are slammed at 100% utilization. I'm happy to keep waiting, but the script comments say this script should finish in 3:30 minutes (which I read as 3min 30sec?) on CPU...unless that is 3 hours 30 minutes?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\n# install nix if not already installed\r\n> curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh\r\n> git clone https://github.com/tbenst/nixpkgs.git\r\n> cd nixpkgs\r\n> git checkout deeplabcut\r\n> nix-build -I nixpkgs=. -A python3Packages.deeplabcut\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: **NixOS 20.03**\r\n - DeepLabCut Version [e.g. 22] (please check with ``import deeplabcut``, ``deeplabcut.__version__``) **2.1.6**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have slightly modified deeplabcut's required python packages to use Nix's distributed versions: https://github.com/tbenst/nixpkgs/blob/ced8ca5dba8f2e00cd45fd5904f0b08593db205a/pkgs/development/python-modules/deeplabcut/default.nix#L103. Additionally, I run testscript headlessly using `xvfb-run`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
