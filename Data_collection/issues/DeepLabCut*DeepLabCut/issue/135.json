In https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#i-video-analysis-and-plotting-results, I found that I should fix init_weight, but I don't know how should I fix. I tried to change init_weights to \r\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\LinearChamber-KAIST-2018-11-19\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\LinearChamberNov19-trainset95shuffle1\\train\\snapshot-1000,\r\nBut it doesn't work and my kernel dead(I made snapshot-1000 folder and put all snapshot-1000 related 3 files-snapshot-1000.index, snapshot-1000.meta, snapshot-1000.data-00000-of-00001) .\r\nI feel init_weights should be changed changed to some ~.ckpt file but I can't find any ~.ckpt file in the C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\LinearChamber-KAIST-2018-11-19\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\LinearChamberNov19-trainset95shuffle1\\train folder.\r\nCould you let me know how to retrain?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16134605/49134347-9cd03e00-f326-11e8-81b4-4ae4b7d748cf.png)\r\n\r\nAnd I got this message again and again.. may I know where is all_model_checkpoint_paths please? I can't find the variable in any deeplabcut files..\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. train to 1000 and snapshot of 1000 made in train folder\r\n2. change init_weights in pose_cfg.yaml to C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\LinearChamber-KAIST-2018-11-19\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\LinearChamberNov19-trainset95shuffle1\\train\\snapshot-1000,make snapshot-1000 folder in train folder, put 3 snapshot files in it\r\n4. train to 2000 and my kernel dead\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
