It seems like the filesize of the frames might just be too big for my GPU to handle. There's part of the frame I could crop out, and hopefully reduce the file size enough to solve the problem, I would just rather not have to start back over from the labeling step, and have to label each frame again if that'd be possible. Is that something I could do?
