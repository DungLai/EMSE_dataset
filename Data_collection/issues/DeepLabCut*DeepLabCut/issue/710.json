I have a paradigm where marmosets reach for food rewards. See screenshot below. I have been labeling points on the right hand (wrist, knuckles, tips/fingernails), points on the left hand (same), and points on the face (nose and perimeter of white patch). In past DLC versions, points would occasionally jump from hand to hand - usually only at noncritical points of the reach, but it's still something I would like to miminize. Would it make sense to define each hand and the face as three separate individuals? We don't need true multianimal estimation b/c there's only one marmo at a time. But, the question is, should these three elements be defined as individuals or should they just be different, separate skeletons to best utilize the update? Thanks!! Appreciate your time and contributions so much!!\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n![img6812](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26383714/83071154-a715ea00-a03a-11ea-8791-03d2f1d46798.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
