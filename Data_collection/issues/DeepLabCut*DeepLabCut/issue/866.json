I have encountered 2 major issues when trying to refine tracklets. \r\n\r\n1) Some of the hot keys don't seem to work on my Windows 10 desktop and/or Mac. Tab for play/pause the videos doesn't work on both of them, left/right arrow for changing the frames don't work on my Windows 10 desktop. I'm wondering if you know any tips to make these work? It's been difficult to navigate through the videos without these functions..\r\n\r\n2) I am trying to track 8 points per animal with 2 animals in a video (i.e. example image 1), in some frames there are missing points (i.e. example image 2), I'm wondering if I can still add points during this step? Or what I can do to avoid missing points from happening?\r\n\r\nexample image 1\r\n<img width=\"975\" alt=\"WeChat Screenshot_20200821141943\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54284554/90922177-85b66700-e3b9-11ea-9f81-6357bdef8216.png\">\r\n\r\nexample image 2\r\n<img width=\"975\" alt=\"WeChat Screenshot_20200821141932\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54284554/90922176-851dd080-e3b9-11ea-818f-f16131d8a162.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"akazawayukidai","id":54284554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Mjg0NTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54284554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai","html_url":"https://github.com/akazawayukidai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akazawayukidai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
