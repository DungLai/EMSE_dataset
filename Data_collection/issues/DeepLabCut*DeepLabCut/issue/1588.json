Please describe.**\r\nWish List of Quality of Life improvements to the Labelling UI\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWishlist (expected quality of life improvement measured in ❤️s)\r\n- Display the video name with the image name at the top of UI. [❤️❤️❤️]\r\n- Easier ways to switch between videos (eg. pageup/down loads next/previous video in folder sorted by name) [❤️❤️❤️]\r\n- Check labels should create a single summary folder (perhaps with symbolic links) [❤️❤️]\r\n- Save, Quit, and Open Behavior (eg. ctrl+s, ctrl+q, ctrl+o) [❤️❤️]\r\n- Jump to next unlabeled frame (eg. shift+arrows) [❤️]\r\n- Fix label-deletion. After deleting a label GUI doesn't update immediately and gives an error when trying to create a new label for that bodypart. [❤️]\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently some of these UI interactions feel slower than actually labelling the images. \r\n\r\neg clicking the UI buttons to switch between videos when labelling many videos (save->quit->yes->select video->open). Having a next video button (perhaps by sorting parent folder and finding index of current video) also removes the navigation difficulty of finding new unlabeled frames. I often keep a text editor open to record the videos I've labeled, I'm sure some others have used similar approaches.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWilling to help implement","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1588/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
