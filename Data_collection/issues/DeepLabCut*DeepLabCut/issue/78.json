Mostly there is code that is missing in this version, plus a few changes in defaults and a few bugfixes (e.g. removing references to missing modules, and fully specifying the session name before saving to disk). Other than the bugfixes, I am wondering if there is any reason not to use eldar's version, which is presumably more up to date? For instance, were there any features that were intentionally removed or added?\r\n\r\nAlso I think it would be better if these modules could be imported so that we don't have to train in the models directory. But there is a lot of namespace confusion in pose-tensorflow, e.g. modules and files that have the same name as variables, and resulting issues with relative imports. I saw in another issue a reference to an ongoing project to \"modularize\" DeepLabCut. Would it be possible to elaborate on your plans for modularization? I am just wondering if I should create my own fork and do that kind of cleanup, or just wait if there is an impending new version.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nChris","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
