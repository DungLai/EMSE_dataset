Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nWhen I used DLC version 2.2.1 to label the frames and switched to version 2.1.8.1 to create a training dataset and train the network,  the error ocurred: “TypeError: expected str […] not tuple”.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.1.8.1\r\ndlc version 2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu & cpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI used the standard environment as in the Documentation to create a new DLC project in version 2.2.1 using CPU and labeled the Frames of the video. \r\nFor the training I wanted to switch on a server to use GPU, where the DLC version 2.1.8.1 is installed. \r\nWhen I try to create the training dataset there it throws the following error: “TypeError: expected str […] not tuple”\r\nI also checked the .csv files and the ones created in 2.1.8.1 have a different structure than the ones created in 2.2.1 (as also described in this forum: https://forum.image.sc/t/labelling-images-on-different-devices-leads-to-typeerror-expected-str-not-tuple-and-different-csv-content/64109.\r\nCreating a new .h5-file in version 2.2.1 from the .csv-files from version 2.1.8.1 also gave an error. \r\nCreating the Training dataset in version 2.1.8.1 did work, but using this trainingset in 2.2.1 did not.\r\nI could start the training on the CPU in version 2.1.8.1 without any problems.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104254966/175567408-f539dca4-8b8a-42ab-9f04-3fc508f36519.png)\r\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of
