I have 1000+ annotations. Both training and validation functions were working pretty well. But after few runs, an error started to appear at the same iteration index. But the training session doesn't stop. However, It eventually freezes my ipython session, advising me to force quit the session. I tried running this multiple times, it freezes at the exact same iteration too. Perhaps, one of my images are corrupted as it is having trouble with cv2.resize. But the training continues even after the error. \r\nWhy does it freeze only after few more iterations from the occurrence of the error?\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run DLC GUI\r\n2. Start a training session with a ResNet-50 while keeping all the other settings as defaults\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nHere's the error\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17251474/69016103-0676ab80-09c1-11ea-822a-27bf363e1a2b.png)\r\n\r\nAfter some time, it freezes the session\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17251474/69016112-1f7f5c80-09c1-11ea-9c3f-f9b3d415a200.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17251474/69016293-2e670e80-09c3-11ea-8b19-7f9e8aca46c9.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm pretty sure this is a data specific problem. I just need some help figuring out the origination of this.  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/493/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
