I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and installed the most recent version of deeplabcut. I was impressed by the GUI dlc, but however unexpected problem occurred.\r\n I use resnet_50 to train my datasets. It is weird that it is much slower than before and it stops at around 100~2000 iteration. GPU engagement is about 10% and after a few hundred iterations suddenly it becomes 0% and freezes. First I wondered it is out of memory situation but the percent of memory used does not exceed 50%. (Memory is 36GB)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765485/67831432-a4ddc280-fb21-11e9-8e19-fdace25ce1be.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765485/67832184-233b6400-fb24-11e9-922a-a0cc83debbbb.png)\r\n\r\nI know 1060 is not fast, but it worked quite well with the previous version of the deeplabcut!\r\nI tried to go back to the previous version, and I find it really difficult to install the old version of the deeplabcut. \r\n\r\nBy the way training works well with mobilenet (using over 70% of the GPU), however, performance is poor compared with resnet in my datasets. Cannot use it :(\r\n\r\nThx in advance!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/468/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
