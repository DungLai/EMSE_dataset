I was able to use it a few days ago on a slightly different test case. I tried all the solutions from previous issues with similar problem (making sure GPU doesn't have any other running processes, making sure the Config.yaml file is correct, etc...). Finally I realized that the only thing I changed since it worked on the previous test case was the image size - previously it was 384 x 384, but now I went down to 94x94. I zoomed my images back to 384x384, started a new project, relabeled the training frames, and now the training runs again just fine.   \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nJust follow the \"Demo_yourowndata.ipynb\" notebook from the provided examples, with a dataset where your images are small (94x94 in my case). \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen you go through the first few steps and run \"train_network\" it will get stuck. It won't report any errors. It will just be stuck. If you run \"nvidia-smi\" you will see the process properly sitting on the GPU but no training will occur. \r\n\r\nI think there needs to be some documentation about minimum image size required for training. Additionally there should be some error thrown by train_network, it shouldn't just get stuck without any useful feedback!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
