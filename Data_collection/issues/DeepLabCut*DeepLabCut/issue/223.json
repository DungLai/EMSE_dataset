I don't use conda (the whole purpose of using Docker image)\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe way I am using DLC is the following. Suppose I have video1. With video1, I extracted frames, trained, and created a labeled video. Now I have a video2 that needs to be labeled (and similar to video1). I do not wanna label these all over again by hand, so what I did was using `add_new_videos`, i added video2 to my config, analyze using the trained network (from video1), create a labeled video, and watch how it performed. Since it is a domain transfer, the labeled video is less accurate/reliable compared to video1. Some are well labeled, some are bad. On those bad ones, I would like to _manually_ select those frames if I can via `extract_outlier_frames`. Unfortunately, the current settings do not allow the manual extraction.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a manual mode. I think we can reuse the GUI toolbox for `refine_labels` but allows the user to scan the entirety of the video. On the frames that the user considers as an _outlier_,  the user can either move the markers or delete the markers, then save those corrected labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCan't think of a better way for manual mode\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDescribed above","closed_by":{"login":"DonnieKim411","id":23262857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjYyODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23262857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411","html_url":"https://github.com/DonnieKim411","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
