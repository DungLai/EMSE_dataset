But it yielded an installation error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: An error occurred while performing the step: \"Building kernel modules\". See /var/log/nvidia-installer.log for details.\r\n\r\nERROR: An error occurred while performing the step: \"Checking to see whether the nvidia kernel module was successfully built\".\r\nSee /var/log/nvidia-installer.log for details.\r\n\r\nERROR: The nvidia kernel module was not created.\r\n\r\nERROR: Installation has failed. Please see the file '/var/log/nvidia-installer.log' for details. You may find suggestions on\r\nfixing installation problems in the README available on the Linux driver download page at www.nvidia.com.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to NVIDIA developer website, the driver 384.xx is outdated.\r\nhttps://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/i-cant-install-nvidia-driver-an-error-occurred-while-performing-the-step-building-kernel-modules/72239\r\nI also tried 410.93 driver referring to this web site, but I got the same error.\r\nhttps://optogeneticsandneuralengineeringcore.gitlab.io/ONECoreSite/projects/DeepLabCut/\r\n\r\nI have tried the newer 450.80.02 driver, but CUDA 11.0 was automatically installed and yielded an error when I ran deeplabcut.train_network(). The error message was like that:\r\n`Failed to get convolution algorithm. This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see if a warning log message was printed above.`\r\n\r\nWhat version of driver should I use? Thank you in advance.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
