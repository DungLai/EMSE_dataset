Please describe.**\r\nWith the new update (2.2), I don't now anymore where to find the mean pixel error when evaluating a network. It doesn't appears in the terminal anymore and there is no .csv file in the evaluation-results folder. I also tried running dlc.return_evaluate_network_data() but it only return the path of a hdf5 file (which doesn't seem to contain any pixel errors).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWould be nice to get similar pixel error than in previous deeplabcut version to be able to compare the new version (using the skeleton) to previously trained networks. Currently the evaluation procedure seems quite confusing to me.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AntoineCribel","id":32539652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM5NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32539652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel","html_url":"https://github.com/AntoineCribel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntoineCribel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/707/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
