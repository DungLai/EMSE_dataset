When calling `extract_outlier_frames(config_path, [videos], videotype=\".m4v\")`, kmeans clustering proceeds as expected. After indicating which frames are to be selected, the codes fails with an UnboundLocalError that reads \"local variable 'image' referenced before assignment. \"\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Launch pythonw\r\n2. Execute:\r\n```python\r\nimport deeplabcut as dlc\r\nconfig_path = \"/your/path/here/config.yaml\"\r\nvideos = \"/your/path/here/videos/\"\r\ndlc.extract_outlier_frames(config_path, [videos], videotype=\".m4v\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code should proceed through all videos, selecting the specified number of frames.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nI have attached a screenshot of the executed code producing the error, and 2 additional photos, showing the results of `conda list` for the activated environment.\r\n<img width=\"240\" alt=\"UnboundLocalError\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43184541/72848442-96133180-3c72-11ea-987c-45262d1553ab.png\">\r\n<img width=\"320\" alt=\"Conda environment 2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43184541/72848443-96133180-3c72-11ea-9905-e1f177bdd64b.png\">\r\n<img width=\"240\" alt=\"Conda environment 1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43184541/72848444-96133180-3c72-11ea-82ae-20a637ffad51.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: iOS (Catalina)\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.5.2\r\n - No browser. In terminal.app.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- The conda environment in which I am working was created using the `dlc-macOS-CPU.yaml` environment file provided in the `deeplabcut` module. \r\n- I suspect this is related to #190 , and #199. However, the bug was reported to fixed in 2.0.4.1, and I'm using 2.1+. \r\n- In line with #190, I tried running `dlc.extract_outlier_frames` with `opencv=False`. This produced the error \"RuntimeError: imagio.ffmpeg.download() has been deprecated. Use 'pip install imageio-ffmpeg' instead.\" After trying `pip install` as instructed, the error persists - I suspect because I haven't changed that import in the source code.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
