The saved coordinates are `nan, nan`. However, the saved likelihood is `1.00000`. \r\n\r\nOther than just being inaccurate, this creates problems in two realms:\r\n1. Applying splines or other filtering regimes post-DLC where weights are based on likelihood thresholds.\r\n2. Importing data to other workflows, especially 3d reconstruction in Anipose (my case), which uses a simple likelihood threshold for including data in calculations. Anipose will triangulate a point in a frame based on the lowest likelihood among the cameras. One camera with nans and 1.0 and another camera with points and 0.99 likelihood leads to problematic 3d reconstructions.\r\n\r\nSimply setting the default likelihood to 0.0, or setting to 0 the likelihood for any rows of nans per bodypart, would fix it.\r\n\r\nI have not checked to see if this is true in single animal DLC (it shouldn't be though since the nans will only show, I believe, when tracklets can't be formed or stitched for certain frames), or with more than 1 animal in maDLC.\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.3\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
