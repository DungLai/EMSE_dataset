Please describe.**\r\nWith the work I'm doing I need to track mouse paws & tail (sample image attached below).  As you can see, when I first used DLC I labeled paws, ankles, legs, tail base and mid-tail.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIn a Python script I would like to select the joint landmarks (e.g., \"left_ankle, left_paw, etc.\") and be able to track and calculate around those joints only.  Is that possible with DLC?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis feature would be used to calculate several things:\r\n- the Euclidean distance from the ankle to the tail base\r\n- the change of angle formed by the paw and the leg\r\n- the horizontal and vertical velocity of the paw\r\n- and I'm sure more things once I find a program which offers such a feature!\r\n\r\n\r\n![img3278_individual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101142209/165417265-1cd42749-b795-4e19-bc88-7daf057a1b24.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
