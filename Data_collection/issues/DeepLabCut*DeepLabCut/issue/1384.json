I seem to have broken my previously working GPU build when I was following instructions to upgrade to 2.2rc3... I am not even sure how to ask for help on that one yet. Working on it. Deleting and re-creating the DEEPLABCUT environment did not fix it. So something must have happened to programs outside the environment.  I think at this point I tried enough things that I need to completely uninstall CUDA, etc and 'start from scratch', which from googling seems like actually a hard thing to do. If you have any good resources to point me to for removing everything associated with the GPU set up in order to start from scratch let me know.
