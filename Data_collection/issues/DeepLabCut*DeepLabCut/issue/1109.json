How can I add a line tracking (or tail tracking) feature to the labeled video? (Where a body part (or multiple) leave lines, I attached a picture of an example I saw in a paper).\r\n\r\n![PHOTO-2021-02-07-14-35-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77503430/107393155-d9844c00-6ad0-11eb-8052-bc21f20cfbbb.jpg)\r\n\r\n2. When I try to extract outlier frames for a second time (using google Colab), I'm pretty sure it gives me the same frames as the first time. How can I do it multiple times? Which h5 file is the correct one? Is there a way to re-label more than 20 frames? I had to go back to the program on my computer to label, then replace the files, then run Colab again the first time. Does this erase the training or make it better?
