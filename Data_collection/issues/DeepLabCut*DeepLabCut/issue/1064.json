First of all, thank you very much for your work. I have a problem when viewing frames. I cannot extract the frames because pictures(jpg) are not visible when I go into the related file. However when I enter the same file from the desktop, I see the files are there.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. Windows10 Home 19042.685]\r\n - DeepLabCut Version [2.1.9] \r\n - DeepLabCut mode: single animal tracking, \r\n - Browser, if applicable [chrome,]\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. Go to '...'\r\n2. Click on '....'\r\n3. Scroll down to '....'\r\n4. the input code you used (i.e. `deeplabcut.train_network( .... )`)\r\n4.
