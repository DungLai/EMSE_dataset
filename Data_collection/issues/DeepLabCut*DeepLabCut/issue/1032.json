I successfully extracted frames from my first video but when trying to extract frames from the next video I received an error message. I tried to extract additional frames from the first video and now receive the error message with that video as well. Someone else working on this project, @neurologic , is able to extract frames from all videos using the same Deeplabcut version and Mac OS. I have tried extracting frames using both the command line interface and the GUI and run into the same error message.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: MacOS Catalina\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.2b8\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: multi-animal tracking\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. deeplabcut.extract_frames(config_path,\"automatic\", \"kmeans\", True)\r\n2.
