It doesn't put a marker, nothing. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nFollowing this video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcXogR-p5Ak - from 2:00 after selecting the video frames, and the first one shows up on the toolbox, the user in the video simply clicks to label bodyparts, however when I do the same nothing shows up, even when I manually click on bodyparts and adjust the marker size and try again, it doesn't change.\r\n\r\nDesktop (please complete the following information about your system):\r\n\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\r\nDeepLabCut Version 2.0 \r\n\r\nAlso the CSV file created doesn't have any values recorded (it is an empty template)\r\nThe pan, zoom, Home works.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn't react at all when I try to label by clicking on the image (nor when I try to pick a color)\r\n\r\nThis is what I get on the console:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [2]: deeplabcut.launch_dlc()                                                                                                                                                                             \r\nCreated \"/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/videos\"\r\nCreated \"/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/labeled-data\"\r\nCreated \"/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/training-datasets\"\r\nCreated \"/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/dlc-models\"\r\nCreating the symbolic link of the video\r\nCreated the symlink of /home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/videos/capture2.avi to /home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/videos/capture2.avi\r\nCreated the symlink of /home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/videos/capture2.avi to /home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/videos/capture2.avi\r\n/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/videos/capture2.avi\r\n/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/videos/capture2.avi\r\nGenerated \"/home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/New-D-2019-11-19/config.yaml\"\r\n\r\nA new project with name New-D-2019-11-19 is created at /home/d/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master and a configurable file (config.yaml) is stored there.
