I believe the alpha channels in the current DLC package might not be properly blended into the RGB channels (e.g. RGBA images aren't being converted into RGB, if required). Evaluating my network I've trained in DLC, the following error appears.\r\n\r\n\"ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (1, 1796, 2412, 4) for Tensor Placeholder:0, which has shape (1, None, None, 3)\"\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have code that can change the number of color channels considered?
