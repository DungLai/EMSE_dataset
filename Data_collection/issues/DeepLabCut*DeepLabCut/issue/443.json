When I run the function on an old config file it still works. However, I am able to create a new project, add videos and extract frames. The GUI loads at first, but as soon as I select a folder to label, the GUI crashes and a ValueError is thrown. This problem crashes Python sometimes as well. I have seen past errors with regards to wxPython and the solutions posed have not fixed my problem. It should also be noted that the DLC error regarding unique labels is not reflected in the cfg['bodyparts']. Finally, please note that we are storing and accessing the config files from a network server. I have tried storing both the project and videos locally, but to no avail, nor when I open a new command prompt.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\n1. Create a new project\r\n2. Extract frames\r\n3. deeplabcut.label_frames()\r\n4. Select a folder\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![error1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25079885/66273702-210c1f80-e86e-11e9-8d3a-b6e5484d9e32.PNG)\r\n![error2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25079885/66273704-22d5e300-e86e-11e9-87bb-84c5a6c9380d.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have had a similar issue in the past that was apparently related to wx, but it seemed resolved overnight.","closed_by":{"login":"sachaker","id":25079885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDc5ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25079885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker","html_url":"https://github.com/sachaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachaker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/443/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
