But the identities still switch when the animal are close.\r\n\r\nHere an illustration of a sequence when it switches (on simba):\r\n\r\n![id1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/89543653-78b64700-d801-11ea-905e-a32dc0e12c69.png)\r\n\r\n![id2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/89543667-7d7afb00-d801-11ea-8263-63c25e9a3b68.png)\r\n\r\nI wrote a similar issue on the Simba github, because I don't know at which stage precisely we should change our parameters to avoid this problem. But I guess the problem could appear as early as during the training/analyzing of the model/videos. \r\n\r\nFYI: I am using dlc 2.b7, on windows 7. We labeled 100 frames, and run 75000 iterations. \r\nOur videos are in mp4, with a  640x480 resolution. \r\n\r\nThe shaved spot was pretty small (but still visible to the naked eye, so that we have been able to systematically label the shaved animal with the same identity) . Do you think that expending the shaving, and increasing the visibility of the brighter spot could help dlc to distinguish the two mice? (if the problem comes from dlc). Please let me know if you have any suggestion that could fix this problem, \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBest, \r\nDorian \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
