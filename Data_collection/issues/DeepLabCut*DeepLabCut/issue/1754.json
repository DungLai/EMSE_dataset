Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nIn the paper(Multi-animal pose estimation and tracking with DeepLabCut)I found that four **affinity models** was used during the tracklet stitching stage(Motion affinity, Spatial proximity, Shape similarity, Dynamic similarity).\r\n\r\nBut in the code, some of the methods are never called:\r\nin stitch.py, motion_affinity_with() ,shape_dissimilarity_with(), dynamic_similarity_with()...\r\n\r\nI want to know whether our code use the affinity models mentioned above. \n\n###
