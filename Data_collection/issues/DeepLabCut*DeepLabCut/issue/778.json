After decreasing the minimalnumberofconnections and pafthreshold parameters in inference_cfg.yaml, I now get tracklets for multi-animal body parts using the box tracker, but the unique body parts are still missing. I checked the detections video at pcutoff 0.9 and all labels I expect to see are in the video; tracking is good quality and actually better for unique body parts than the multi-animal ones. I played with the other parameters (both those that are cross-validated and those that are not) but I'm unable to get all labels to appear.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMy cross-validation results:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66742593/86368593-43a05d00-bc75-11ea-9e05-01e0454d0cbe.png)\r\n\r\nMy inference_cfg.yaml file:\r\n\r\naddlikelihoods: 0.15\r\naveragescore: 0.1\r\nboundingboxslack: 10\r\ndetectionthresholdsquare: 0.1\r\ndistnormalization: 700\r\ndistnormalizationLOWER: 50\r\niou_threshold: 0.2\r\nlowerbound_factor: 0.5\r\nmax_age: 100\r\nmethod: m1\r\nmin_hits: 12\r\nminimalnumberofconnections: 1\r\npafthreshold: 0.020727079665286208\r\ntopktoretain: 3\r\nupperbound_factor: 1.25\r\nvariant: 0\r\nwithid: false\r\n\r\nNote 1: Every unique body part is over-connected to every other unique body part so I don't expect a problem with the skeleton.\r\nNote 2: There are 4 multi-animal body parts and 12 unique body parts, perhaps differences in number are important.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
