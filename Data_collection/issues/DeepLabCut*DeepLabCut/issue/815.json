I've just started to transition to version 2.2 for multi-animal tracking. I've been working in the Project Manager (though I previously used older versions of DLC in a jupyter notebook).\r\n\r\nI set up my first multi-animal project and it worked through the annotation and training of the network. I refined several videos because there were some instances when it switched which mouse was which and I think that also went smoothly. \r\n\r\nHowever, after I did this refinement in the GUI, I attempted to merge the dataset and re-train the network. When I tried to train the network, I got an Index Error. I'm not sure how to interpret this error or how to figure out what went wrong. I'm unsure if I made a mistake in the refinement GUI, in merging the datasets, or in attempting to train the network. \r\n\r\nDo you have advice about how to figure out exactly what's going wrong using the Project Manager GUI? Or in terminal? The screenshot below is from the terminal window when this happened. I had tried to restart the GUI and then train the network with iteration 1. Thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"987\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-06 at 4 47 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22033541/87988732-cff0b380-caae-11ea-900e-8cfbe0f3c58a.png\">\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
