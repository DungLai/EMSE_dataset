Once I start analyzing videos CPU usage spikes to 100% but GPU usage is near idle. The console indicates a GPU is not detected `no NVIDIA GPU device is present: /dev/nvidia0 does not exist`. Running deeplabcut-docker bash -v /home/user:/home/user command line + `nvidia-smi` does not detect the command.\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 20.04.4 LTS\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nDocker latest-gui\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nTesla M40 24 GB\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04.4 plus updates\r\n2. Install Nvidia driver 510.47.03\r\n3. `pip install deeplabcut-docker`\r\n4. `deeplabcut-docker gui`\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer_v1.py:1692: UserWarning: `layer.apply` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
