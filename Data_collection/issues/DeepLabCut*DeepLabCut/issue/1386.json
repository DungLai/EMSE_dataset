I made multiple shuffles to compare different architectures and all models appear to have trained successfully. For all architectures I have saved multiple snapshots. After training with resnet_152 and efficentnet-b6 I am able to run deeplabcut.evaluate_network() with the config file containing the line \"snapshotindex:  all\" and successfully compare all snapshots. However, when I try this for the shuffle trained with DLCRnet it will successfully evaluate the first snapshot but then I get error shown below. \r\n\r\nAny ideas what might be tripping this?\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error, train a model with dlcrnet_ms5 and save multiple snapshots. Then run deeplabcut.evaluate_network() with the config file containing the line \"snapshotindex:  all\"\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-3-d8dddb11b5e5> in <module>\r\n----> 1 deeplabcut.evaluate_network(config_path, Shuffles=[0], trainingsetindex=0, plotting=False, show_errors=True, rescale=False)\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\core\\evaluate.py in evaluate_network(config, Shuffles, trainingsetindex, plotting, show_errors, comparisonbodyparts, gputouse, rescale, modelprefix, c_engine)\r\n    560\r\n    561         # TODO: Make this code not so redundant!\r\n--> 562         evaluate_multianimal_full(\r\n    563             config=config,\r\n    564             Shuffles=Shuffles,\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\core\\evaluate_multianimal.py in evaluate_multianimal_full(config, Shuffles, trainingsetindex, plotting, show_errors, comparisonbodyparts, gputouse, modelprefix, c_engine)\r\n    543                         if not os.path.isfile(uncropped_data_path):\r\n    544                             print(\"Selecting best skeleton...\")\r\n--> 545                             crossvalutils._rebuild_uncropped_in(evaluationfolder)\r\n    546                             _ = crossvalutils.cross_validate_paf_graphs(\r\n    547                                 config,\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\lib\\crossvalutils.py in _rebuild_uncropped_in(base_folder)\r\n    261                     metadata = pickle.load(file)\r\n    262                 params = _set_up_evaluation(data)\r\n--> 263                 _rebuild_uncropped_data(\r\n    264                     data, params, full_data_file.replace(\".pickle\", \"_uncropped.pickle\")\r\n    265                 )\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\lib\\crossvalutils.py in _rebuild_uncropped_data(data, params, output_name)\r\n    214                             sl1 = np.ix_(map_[ind1][0], map_[ind2][0])\r\n    215                             sl2 = np.ix_(map_[ind1][1], map_[ind2][1])\r\n--> 216                             mask = costs_pred[n][\"m1\"][sl2] > costs[n][\"m1\"][sl1]\r\n    217                             if mask.any():\r\n    218                                 inds_lin = (sl1[0] * n_individuals + sl1[1])[mask]\r\n\r\nIndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"blogeman","id":62612214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjEyMjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62612214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman","html_url":"https://github.com/blogeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
