It works really well for like 80% of the video but there's a lot of jumping around. It's usually just a couple of frames and then back to the correct body part. I am very comfortable in MatLab since most of our data analysis is done there, so I did a little smoothing on the position data from the `.csv` in MatLab. When I tried to use the `create_labeled_video` function, I realized that uses the `.h5` data to make the video and there doesn't appear to be an option to use the `.csv`, which would be really useful for me.\r\n\r\nI could probably figure out a way to use the `.csv` (or just get more familiar with python and `.h5`) but was wondering if anyone else would find a `.csv` option useful or had an easy workaround/advice.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
