I have an issue where plotted points on refining tracklets are way too different compare to the create video for checking detection. Major plotted points' swap between male and female marmosets were occurred along the refining tracklets. Some even mixed wrongly for the body parts but created video for checking detection was fine. How can I fixed them without refining them one by one throughout frames in tracklets? This is my config.yaml and inference_config.yaml.
