For starters, I am using 2 machine vision cameras that are facing a mouse that is strapped in place. The camera's are set at about 2 O'clock and 10 O'clock. The mouse's nose is always in the direction of 12 O'clock. My ultimate goal is that I want to triangulate my 2 videos and understand the space they live in. \r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm having a problem with this set-up using the 'deeplabcut.calibrate_cameras' function, as they are not properly finding corners for my images, even though the grid is large in the field of view and is very crisp. \r\n\r\nHere are one pair of photos for my calibration photos. I have taken 200 pairs of this. The grid is on a pole which is rotated about the 2-camera's field of views.\r\n![Front-114](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27032080/122088734-a7129480-cdcb-11eb-8a6c-7273d6307384.jpg)\r\n![Side-114](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27032080/122088736-a7129480-cdcb-11eb-9fd9-35c45290f6e4.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn the past I have had this step (i.e., the calibrate_camera function) work, which then facilitates my next set of questions. I will be doing multiple imaging sessions, each will have very slight variations of camera positions. I would like to ensure that these sessions are coregistered, but there is large ambiguity about what space the DLC-3D lives in:\r\n\r\n1.) Where is the origin placed? \r\n2.) What are the directions of the basis vectors and what determines them? \r\n3.) How can I ensure a coregistered space for imaging sessions that have  very slight differences in camera position?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jonahpc","id":27032080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDMyMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27032080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc","html_url":"https://github.com/jonahpc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
