I always get the same error (see Screenshot 1). I am using the easy install procedure with \"conda env create -f dlc-windowsGPU.yaml\". But the same error appered in different environments if I tried to manually install DLC (I have also tried DLC 2.0.9, 2.0.8). The problem is shown on the screenshot. \r\n\r\nIn the 2nd screenshot you see my GPU, CUDA settings.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60619918/73756340-b1e50000-4767-11ea-930d-d5718715b102.PNG)\r\n\r\n![Capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60619918/73756766-697a1200-4768-11ea-824e-4b705304b776.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI went through all problems previously reported, however none could help me to solve the problem.
