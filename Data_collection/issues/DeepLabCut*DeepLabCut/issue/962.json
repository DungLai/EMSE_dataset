Any help would be really appreciated! Heres what I’ve done so far: \r\n1. Installed anaconda\r\n2. Verified that python is installed (python 3.8.3)\r\n3. I have tried various ways (described in documentation) to create the DLC-CPU environment, and none of them have worked. In the past I was able to create an environment by opening the anaconda app, one of the tabs on the left says “environments”, then clicking “import” and selecting DLC-CPU.yaml from my desktop\r\nThis gives two errors:\r\na. \"CondaEnvException: Pip failed”\r\nb. “the “gcc” command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?”\r\nI follow the prompts to install but then receive the message “Can’t install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server.”\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1085\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-16 at 10 13 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73007192/96326439-91f82280-0ffe-11eb-8444-0c0d73f54002.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
