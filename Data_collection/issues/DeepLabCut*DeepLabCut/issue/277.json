Please describe.**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOur potential use case is to track social relationships amongst 9 group house macaque monkeys. Individuals move around the home environment (a rectangular room), and individuals who spend more time in physical interaction (i.e. grooming) have closer relationships. Ideally we'd like to track the 3D pose to measure specific types of physical interaction, rather than just proximity.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWell, currently this needs to be done manually...\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe will place multiple cameras in the home environment. Although social relationships can most simply be inferred from proximity, this fails to account for the actual social interaction among pairs of monkeys (grooming as the canonical example). We have the luxury of adding additional data, in the form of digital accelerometers on each individual, and so we can try to combine the two data streams post-hoc. But I wondered how to use the accelerometer data to feed in to improve DLC estimation? Another option is to try to use a parallel face recognition network (macaques are pretty distinguishable) to create the individual subject labels. What other features would be required for this kind of use case to be viable?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
