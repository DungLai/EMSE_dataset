I prefer handbrake to ffmpeg simply because the Handbrake gui and queue makes it very nice and easy to crop videos in batches with specific crop coordinates for each video.\r\n\r\nAfter training a model for 300K iterations and analyzing videos, the dlc.extract_outlier_frames function detects 50%-75% of frames as outliers (using all default parameters for extract_outlier_frames). When I run refine_labels, the labels appear to be relatively close to correct, but possibly in the location where the mouse was one frame previously, so I am wondering if this could be an issue of frame correspondence.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1149\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-22 at 9 29 42 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47009665/88185211-ab592080-cc01-11ea-8d62-d0a38d0583b6.png\">\r\n\r\nDLC is accurately detecting the frame rate, so it isn't an issue similar to #475, though the screenshot posted [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/475#issuecomment-549157610) looks somewhat similar, with more offset.\r\n\r\nI am now downsampling all of my videos without changing the frame rate, to see if that changes the results, but I am hoping one of you can share insight on why this may be happening, and if this may indeed be a frame shift, or if I just need to create better training data and label more frames or run for more iterations.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
