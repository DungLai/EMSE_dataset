I've generated my training frames and trained using a cropped region of the video (x1=0, x2=1920, y1=380, y2=650).  The frames are correctly cropped in the UnaugmentedDataSet folders.  However, when I go to analyze the full video with the same ROI specified in myconfig_analysis.py, the whole frame is analyzed.  Since I didn't train with the whole frame, it picks out features that are incorrect outside of the ROI.  Is there a setting that I'm missing?\r\n\r\nThanks for you help.\r\n\r\nThong \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tm2775","id":44786682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Nzg2Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44786682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775","html_url":"https://github.com/tm2775","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tm2775/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
