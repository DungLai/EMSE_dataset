It says \"File dialog failed with error code 3003\". Before the update, I would occasionally have this error when selecting videos, but it could easily be fixed with a DLC restart. \n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nChanged from v2.2.0.1 (where the projects were trained) to v2.2.0.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (Game Ready Driver)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.) Enter the DLC environment\r\n2.) Open Python then the DLC GUI\r\n3.) Open a project which has been trained on about 400 frames\r\n4.) Click the Analyze Videos tab and attempt to add >2,500 videos (or ~2.2 million frames)\r\n5.) Popup window appears saying \"Python Error: File dialog failed with error code 3003.\"\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nI'm sorry I can't figure out how to get the logs output, but nothing appears in the python terminal window.\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI have to analyze tens of thousands of videos for each project so being able to add these videos in larger batches would help me greatly.
