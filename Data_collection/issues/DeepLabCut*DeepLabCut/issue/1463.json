However, now I have an issue where I tried updating to 2.2.0 (the most recent update that came out 10 days ago I believe?) it only updated to 2.2rc3 and recreated the same error. I have tried reinstalling cudatoolkit with the command mentioned in the previous issue a few times but still no avail. I tried other versions too but regardless it won't eliminate the error. Is 2.2rc3 the latest version?\r\nWhat I was expecting was being able to update to 2.2.0 and not have the error pop up again; however, I'm uncertain if I installed the right information/toolkit\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2rc3; trying to update\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGeforce GTX 1080 Ti\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) In the environment DLC-GPU, run ipython in the terminal\r\n2)Next, import deeplabcut.     _Cuda toolkit error about the libraries pops up immediately_\r\n3)deeplabcut.__version__     _This then tells me the version is 2.2rc3_\r\n4)pip install \"deeplabcut[gui]\"  _The output from this says all issues are met and no updates were done at all_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n(base) C:\\Users\\ninsellab>activate DLC-GPU\r\n\r\n(DLC-GPU) C:\\Users\\ninsellab>conda install cudatoolkit=10.0\r\nCollecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done\r\nSolving environment: done\r\n\r\n# All requested packages already installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(DLC-GPU) C:\\Users\\ninsellab>ipython\r\nPython 3.7.10 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 19 2021, 15:37:01) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\r\nIPython 7.23.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.

the recommended line worked and this time it did not for some reason and it reappeared while updating. Any help would be much appreciated! I also might be misreading the releases and noting that the new release might be needing to be installed differently.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
