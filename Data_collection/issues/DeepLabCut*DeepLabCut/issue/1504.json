Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Bug description\r\n\r\nHello everyone.\r\n\r\nSo I tried many times in the past to refine my trackless, but DLC is always breaking down after a short amount of time.\r\nI was actually hoping using a cloud-service could solve this problem (thinking it might be because of my weaker desktop) but now I realised that I would still need my local computer for the refinement anyways.\r\nWell, today I actually wanted to create a new set of outliers to label before I put everything on the cloud, but then I had a problem with creating outliers (first time ever, so I might just have made some minor error there, so it doesn't matter that much to me for now. \r\nThe important point is, that I once again tried to at least activate the \"refine\" GUI (thinking that after this DLC might realise that I did already analyze that video) and long story short:\r\nDLC once again gave up on me just after me opening the refine-GUI.\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug, if my system is simply to weak or if I messed something up, but I wanted to mention it here in case there is something that could be done to make that GUI more stable (or maybe just letting me know what I did wrong).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\noperating system\r\n\r\nMacOS high Sierra\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\ncpu version\r\n\r\n DeepLabCut 2.2rc2\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nmulti animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\nUsing the CPU-Env.\r\n(Radeon Pro 560 4096 MB, 3.6 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4)\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Starting GUI in CPU-Environment\r\n2. Going on \"Refine tracklets\"\r\n3. Choose the appropriate el.pickle file, as I did work with ellipse-analysis.\r\n4. Number of animals: 3\r\n5. Click on \"create tracks\"\r\n6. Choosing the unaltered video-file that fits the pickle-file\r\n7. Clicking on \"refine tracklets\"\r\n8. After a few seconds the GUI already closes down \r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n(DLC-CPU) UniversitysiMac:~ psydev20$ pythonw -m deeplabcut\r\nStarting GUI...\r\ncurrently DLCRNet is only supported in multi-animal mode\r\n100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 505/505 [00:00<00:00, 930.69it/s]\r\nVideo duration and data length do not match.
