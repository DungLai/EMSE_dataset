This happened after that I added new label names in the config file and (re)labeled previous and new videos. \r\n\r\nI tried a number of things:\r\n- I made sure every one of the \"old\" videos were updated with the new labels\r\n- I checked every labeled images with deeplabcut.check_labels (everything looks good)\r\n- making a new dlc project from scratch and copy pasting inside only the labeled-data folder\r\n- deeplabcut.dropannotationfileentriesduetodeletedimages\r\n- I checked if coordinates/labels were mixed in the CollectedData_*.csv in the training dataset, but I couldn't find anything wrong, however I noticed that it is using the same labels order than the CollectedData_*.csv of the first labeled video which is different than the order in my config.yaml\r\n\r\nIndeed I also noticed that the order of the label names (in the column) in the .csv files of each labeled video is not always the same. This is because I added new labels and changed the order of the labels in my config file. Is it possible that deeplabcut get confused by that and use the wrong order for the labels?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start labeling some videos (at this point the training and evaluating worked well)\r\n2. Change the order of the labels in the config.yaml\r\n3. Label more videos (I thinks it was still working at this point, but I am not sure)\r\n4. Add new label names in the config.yaml\r\n5. Relabel the previously labeled videos (to add the new labels)\r\n6. Label more videos\r\n7. Train the network + evaluate \r\n8. The marker's labels should be mixed\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNot getting mixed labels ^^\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - Ubuntu Mate 18.04\r\n - DeepLabCut 2.1.7\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
