Please find attached the checkerboard_3d, original_image and undistorted_points. \r\n1) Original_Image: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jy3848dutqewnh0/Original_Image.png?dl=0\r\n2) Undistorted_points: https://www.dropbox.com/s/csq9bpancd2yr90/undistorted_points.png?dl=0\r\n3) Checkerboard_3d: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zq9vw8wx6v79uve/checkerboard_3d.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nI would like to inform you that my setup is orthogonal, and based on the issue #1128, this may be the reason why I am getting black pictures in result. I still have not tried the triangulation part to see if it works, though. Instead, I wanted to try the new Advanced Labeling Across Cameras functions. \r\n\r\nI succeeded in extracting the frames from the videos of camera-7, however once I try the function dlc.extract_frames(config_path_camera-8, mode='match', config3d=config_path3d, extracted_cam=0), I do not get any of the matched frames in return. \r\nI checked the config file paths many times but I can not detected any issue there. Also, the camera names are correct in the config files. \r\n\r\nHere are 2 screenshots of the code in the terminal : \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82345816/116695549-102b7d80-a9c1-11eb-954b-aac989d0f601.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82345816/116695608-23d6e400-a9c1-11eb-88d5-b7d40b060987.png)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like extra documentation and thank you in advance! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nEviana\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
