Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI am using the GUI to do training a tracking task and after I have labeled the data, the next step is to create a training dataset, but I got this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -m deeplabcut\r\nLoading DLC 2.3rc3...\r\nStarting GUI...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

range\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that somehow the dataframe read from the .h5 file is not multiindex. \r\nHow should I fix this?\r\n\r\nPS: my \"individuals\" are not all present in all frames, and sometimes one or more of their \"bodyparts\" are not present because of occlusion. May this be a problem?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\n\n### Operating System\n\nwindows\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.3rc3\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
