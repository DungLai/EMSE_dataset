This is the correct behavior. \r\n\r\nCurrently, it puts a 2D scorer name into the H5, which is suboptimal -- this does not tell us about the 3d project info, and how would one decide which scorer to pull anyhow? One can have different DLC models for each camera, or use the same, etc. \r\n\r\nHere is an example: top is correct (dlc VERSION 2.0.7) and bottom (version 2.2.1.1):\r\n![image (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/184148966-c3f0d06b-4b7f-48b3-9b90-5107cfa69bd9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nOS indepent (but ubuntu)\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.0.7 vs 2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\n3d\n\n### Device type\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun `deeplabcut.triangulation` in version 2.0.7 and version 2.2.1.1\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nissues around here likely...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/8ddb7abde7ee065289149cd24b6cdd33b3605f07/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_3d/triangulation.py#L233\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1941/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
