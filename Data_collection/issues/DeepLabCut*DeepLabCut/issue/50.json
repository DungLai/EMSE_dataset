In Fig.4 of your preprint it appears you achieve this reasonably well for a social behaviour assay using three mice, although it is not specified what modification was necessary to achieve multiple predictions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like an output file which shows the x,y locations at which the network makes many predictions of a particular feature, and then to threshold based on the likelihood to give the features in the environment. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to extract values corresponding to multiple potential predictions in a single image based on the output of the current getpose() function and the predicty.py file found in nnet?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
