I got through Step (5) smoothly, however, in step (6), when I try to train the network by entering: \r\n$ TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3.6 ../../../train.py\r\nand I got the following error:\r\n'TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\r\nI installed TensorFLow and then DeepLabCut under Windows 10 system via \"simplified installation with conda environments for a CPU\". I'm not sure what is going wrong (I am a beginner with python), so any suggestion would be helpful. Thanks. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/80/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
