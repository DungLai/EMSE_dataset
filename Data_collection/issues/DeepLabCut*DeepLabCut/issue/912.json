Label, create training dataset with crop and label, train, evaluate, create a video with all detections\r\n2. **realize that you should extract and label more frames**\r\n2. extract frames (with user feedback on so as to select videos for extraction)\r\n3. answer yes for any video\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\nSample directory organization:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9662673/93487782-9cc27900-f8d3-11ea-9d1f-6efaf6e12198.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n[Line 184 in frame_extraction.py](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/v2.2b8/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/frame_extraction.py#L184) loops through files in cfg: video_sets. But if crop and label was set to true on first pass, video_sets contains paths to \"cropped\" videos, which don't actually exist as videos, just as directories in labeled-images. So, frame extraction fails.\r\n\r\nChanging L184 to 'video_sets_original' fixes the problem, but then breaks the code when creating a project and extracting frames the first time around. \r\n\r\nUnless I'm missing something in the suggested workflow, I think this is a bug?\r\n\r\nI can see two possible fixes: \r\n1. create video_sets_original when creating config file the first time, and any time code needs to reference actual videos (as in frame_extraction.py) have it reference cfg['video_sets_original']\r\n2. In frame_extraction.py use some kind of check (e.g. if video doesn't exist and 'cropped' is in video name), then try again after removing -cropped.\r\n\r\nFor now, my workaround is to change the keys in config.yaml, but I know I'll eventually forget to change them and mess something up. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
