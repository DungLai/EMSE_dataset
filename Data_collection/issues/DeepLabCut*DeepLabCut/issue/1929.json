added 12 videos in total, and I expect the test error may decrease to some extent however it increases instead.\r\nI think the reason is that the more video I loaded the more different the photo may be so the test error may increase.\r\nSo I am wondering how can I prove that I am training a better model through adding more videos and training more times?\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n###
