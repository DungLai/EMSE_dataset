That means that packages like `wxpython` are pre-built for users, and they don't have to struggle getting their system dependenices lined up for the lengthy compilation of wx.\r\n\r\nThe largest disadvantage for conda (and conda-forge) is that it is often not a \"first-class\" package for large packages like tensorflow and pytorch (which are backbones of the ML community). \r\n\r\nHowever, interoperability between channels (and conda-forge) has become a focus as of late and I see interoperability improving.\r\n\r\nFor what its worth, I'm now able to run deeplabcut on linux by running a command\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda create --name dlc deeplabcut wxpython\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have the GUI startup without any compilation.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to get into the pip vs conda debate, but more just asking if there is interested in sharing the workload.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMark\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
