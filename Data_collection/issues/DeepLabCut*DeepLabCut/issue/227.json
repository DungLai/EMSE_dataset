However, closing the window does not allow the function to continue running. The last line shown is my answer to the prompt to extract frames for the video and it won't allow me to execute any other commands, I'm guessing because it's still waiting for me to \"finish\" cropping in the GUI. The same lines of code seem to work just fine when doing it through ipython in Anaconda.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
