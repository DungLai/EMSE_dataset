Use the GUI to create a new project with a video previously downsampled and ready to go\r\n2. Label the frames and create the training set\r\n3. Use a .ipynb to initalize the variables with the correct paths created \r\n4. And then run the above mentioned line - `deeplabcut.train_network(path_config_file, shuffle=1, displayiters=100,saveiters=5000, maxiters=100000,allow_growth=True, max_snapshots_to_keep=5)`\r\n\r\nThe error must appear after a few minutes of training\r\nThe notebook cell does not stop running and, after the error, if I stop it, the kernel of the notebook has to be restarted.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThe files with the information regarding the coordinates of the labeled images and the images themselves are in the correct directory.\r\nI am using the conda installation, with VS code.\r\nThe image that it says is missing is not always the same. The iteration it breaks is not always the same. I could never get past the 18000 iteration, but I was aiming for 100000's.\r\n\r\nThank you for all the help you can give me.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
