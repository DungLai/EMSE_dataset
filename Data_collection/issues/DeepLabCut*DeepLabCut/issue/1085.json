In a given experiment there may be >30 animals, yet there typically are not more than 10 in a frame. Animals are indistinguishable and can leave and enter the frame as they please. I need to assign new IDs to animals that come into the frame, instead of reassigning animals to a previously used, currently vacant ID (default practice in deeplabcut).\r\n\r\n**Additional context /  proposed solution**\r\nI train my network with 20 individuals, and as there are never more than 20 individuals visible at any given time I can track all of them. However, when animal # 1 leaves the field of view, and another random animal comes into the field of view a couple of frames later, that animal gets # 1 assigned (or any other vacant number). However, I would like this new animal to be labelled 21, and any new animal that appears in the field of view n + 1 (so in a long experiment I may use 100s of IDs). In this way I will be able to analyze all behavioral trajectories separately, instead of wrongly/randomly grouping them into 20 ‘individuals’.\r\n\r\n**I’m curious about two things:**\r\n\t1\tis anyone else encountering this issue, and if yes, did anyone solve this?\r\n\t2\tI’m working on some code to reassign trajectories to new ID numbers (i.e. when there is a ‘gap’ in a trajectory, slice that trajectory into multiple IDs), would people be interested in such a function?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"felixhol","id":18172105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTcyMTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18172105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol","html_url":"https://github.com/felixhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
