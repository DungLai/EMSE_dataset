These features were labeled a few months ago (pre DLC 2.2) and I have ~2,000 labeled frames.  DLC < 2.2 did very poorly on these videos, and I was told that skeleton information would be used in DLC >=2.2.\r\n\r\nI've now installed DLC 2.2.6b and specified the skeleton for pairwise features for each animal in these 2,000 previously labeled frames.  I am now training on this dataset.  However, it is not clear whether DLC 2.2.6b is taking advantage of the skeleton information for each of these 4 animals (which have some unique features including body markings and size: pups vs adults).  \r\n\r\nAm I required to re-label all the data using the 2.2.6b multi-animal label tool?  Or does DLC 2.2.6b still use priors for each of these pair-wise features and will incorporate that information automatically.\r\n\r\nAny clarification (or documentation link) is appreciated, the labeling took a student a few weeks, and we're trying to avoid redoing it.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
