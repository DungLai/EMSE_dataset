They are named the same in the config.yaml file of the 2D and 3D projects\r\n2. Both 2D projects (one for camera-1 and the other for camera-2) have the same body parts and skeletons. These were copied and pasted into the 3D project config.yaml file.\r\n3. the scorer 3D name was set to \"DLC_3D\" in the 3D config.yaml\r\n4. Snapshots to use in the config.yaml files is set to -1\r\n5. I now pass the config_path3d and the video_path (which is a path to a new folder where all the videos from two cameras are copied). \r\n6. The triangulation step (seen below) leads to the mentioned error (also see screenshot attached)\r\n\r\nvideo_path = '/home/dlc/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/examples/videos-raw/'\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.triangulate('/home/dlc/Desktop/DeepLabCut-master/examples/testing2-Paula-2020-03-20-3d/config.yaml',video_path, videotype='mp4')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-03-24 13-46-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56651907/77427037-ed01c800-6dd5-11ea-834e-b8562e1c800e.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI am a beginner programmer.
