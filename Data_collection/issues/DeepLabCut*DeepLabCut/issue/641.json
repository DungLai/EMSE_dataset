Please describe.**\r\nI've trained DLC resnet50 and resnet152 on 425 images of 4 gerbils in a home cage.  The features tracked were nose, head and tail for the 4 animals (plus 6 wooden blocks in the cage).  The results are not very good (even slightly worse for resnet152). Here's the link to the video:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fnxz0q8dhoctqey/2020-3-14_09_resnet50_SmallSquare_resnet152_LargeSquare.avi?dl=0\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIs there something else I can do to improve these results aside from adding several hundred more training images?  Should I not track the wooden blocks in the cage (not visualized here)? Does that make things worse for tracking the moving animals?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've tried training using resnet152, but the result is somewhat worse than resnet50.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn the video the smaller square is resnet50 and the larger is resnet152.  The squares are slightly shifted for visualization purpose (and we only show them for likelihood > 0.9).  The colors are 3 features per each animal (nose, head, tail) and each animal has a distinct color. As you can see there are multiple kinds of errors including: both networks continue to mix labels from other animals; the tail is a challenging feature to track; and there are periods where isolated / well visible animals aren't labeled at all (e.g. 1min22sec region where there's a pup just walking around).\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
