When I place a label, remove it with middle-click and then attempt to re-place it again I get an error saying that the body part is already annotated.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nIn the LabelingToolbox interface:\r\n1. Place label using right click\r\n2. Delete label using middle-mouse click, confirm in the dialogue box.\r\n3. Attempt to re-place label using right click\r\n\r\nI get this error dialogue box:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10943932/86037290-0a7aa980-ba37-11ea-88fd-1ac82d1cd7bb.png)\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any related terminal output.\r\n\r\n**Additional**\r\nI can re-place the removed marker if I navigate away from the current frame and return (back one frame, then forward one). Maybe the frame should be refreshed on marker deletion?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
