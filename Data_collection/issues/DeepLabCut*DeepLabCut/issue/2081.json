This happens even though the correct version of CUDA (11.2) is pre-installed along with the correct NVIDIA graphics driver.\r\n\r\nWe found that this problem may be due to the fact that [tensorflow doesn't support native Windows from version > 2.10.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native_1). We fixed the issue by forcing a new CUDNN and compatible tensorflow install after creating the DEEPLABCUT conda environment using the provided yaml file:\r\n\r\n```conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT\r\nconda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0\r\npip uninstall tensorflow\r\npip uninstall tensorflow-intel\r\npip install tensorflow==2.10.0\r\npip install tensorflow-intel==2.10.0 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\n2.2.3\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nsingle animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\ngpu\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
