Animal tracking appears to degrade and totally stop in longer videos. It seems the longer the video, the faster the animal tracking degrades. For example a 30 minute video seems to track all the animals for ~25-30 mins, before it stops tracking them. A 3 hour video will stop tracking all animals in the first 10 minutes. It is tracking them decently beforehand. You'll see the tracks switch animals below, but this is easily accountable post-hoc by designating boundaries. \r\n\r\n\r\nWithin Docker4DeepLabCut2.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!export DLClight=True\r\n\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\nimport glob\r\n\r\npath = '/home/tom/data/behavior/cropped/analyze/'\r\n\r\nvideos = [path + video for video in videos];\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.analyze_videos(config_path, videos, videotype='mp4', gputouse=0) \r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(config_path, videos, videotype='mp4', shuffle=1, trainingsetindex=0, track_method='box') \r\n\r\npickles = glob.glob(path + '*bx*')\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.convert_raw_tracks_to_h5(config_path, pickles)\r\n\r\nfor pickle in pickles:                                                                                                          \r\n   ...:     deeplabcut.convert_raw_tracks_to_h5(config_path, pickle)\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.analyze_videos_converth5_to_csv(path, videotype='.mp4')\r\n```\r\n</summary><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93750302-1e562780-fbb0-11ea-9918-1f0e7d97d17a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93750515-6f661b80-fbb0-11ea-984c-38d3a37e1303.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93750550-7f7dfb00-fbb0-11ea-8e19-dddfbb1e7c46.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAs you can see in the pics above, tracking is lost very early in the video and never recovered. Animals appear to drop off one at a time. You can see this happens early in the video (The video is ~3 hours long and this happens in about the first 5 minutes). \r\n\r\nThe pics below are from a shorter video (~35 mins), but you can see the dropout occurring as well, just further on:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93750969-2d89a500-fbb1-11ea-9cb7-c57a5b143344.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93751054-51e58180-fbb1-11ea-8954-ad388d792f46.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48607760/93751092-5f9b0700-fbb1-11ea-8ac5-820d78f06823.png)\r\n\r\nThis has happened with ~10 videos so far. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on why this is happening would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
