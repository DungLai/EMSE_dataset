Please describe.**\r\n\r\nHello.  We're using maDLC to do multi-animal inference and it is doing pretty good now.  I have a couple of questions regarding retraining the nns with predicted results to get even better predictions.  So I would train on 1500 frames and predict / label ~ 2million. I would then pick 10,000 - 20,000 (or more?) of the predicted frames + initial labels and retrain DLC.\r\n\r\n1.  I know DLC requires unique animal ID tracking - but this is obviously not going to be available on the predicted frames (and correcting the IDs is too much manual work).  Is it ok to train without animal ID preserved? \r\n\r\n2.  Is there a GUI or method already available that can generate the training .csv files from prediction data?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
