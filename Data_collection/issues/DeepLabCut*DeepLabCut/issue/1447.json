Everything went well and I have labelled all my frames with no issues. However, I have tried create the training dataset (with GUI default choices) and I got an error, no .h5 file. I have checked within the labelled images folder and it has created a .csv with all the co-ordinates but no .h5! Why is this? How can I fix this! I can't train without it!\r\n\r\n(I am using the most up to date version of deeplabcut (windows) with a GPU. I have trained multiple times on this laptop using my GPU with no issue)\r\n\r\nCharlotte \r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\noperating system: Windows \r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\ndlc version: 2.2rc3\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nmulti animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\ngpu: NVIDA \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. activate DEEPLABCUT\r\n2. ipython\r\n3. import deeplabcut\r\n4. deeplabcut.launch_dlc()\r\n5. create training dataset (GUI)\r\n6. error:  File C:\\Users\\cw266\\Videos\\gorilla_rotations-charlotte-2021-07-01\\labeled-data\\gorilla1\\CollectedData_charlotte.h5 does not exist \r\n(have checked the folders, it does not exist for any video in the dataset)\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"Charlottewiltshire97","id":68918736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTE4NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68918736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97","html_url":"https://github.com/Charlottewiltshire97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
