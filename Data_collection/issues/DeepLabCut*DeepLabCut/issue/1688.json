Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am acquiring a sequence of images as numpy arrays and then converting them into .tiff format to preserve the image quality.  When creating a new project in deeplabcut, It's frustrating that I have to encode these images into video format first, when deeplabcut extracts frames from the video anyway.  This reduces the quality of the original frame data.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI do not have a trained dataset yet, so having the original higher quality image data to label with would be very helpful.  \r\n\r\nWhen creating a new project, I would like to provide a folder with a sequence of images (eg tiff or numpy arrays) that were acquired during behaviour, instead of providing a video.  This way there's no loss of image quality while converting the images into a video format. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI could first compile the frames into a video (e.g. using python cv2.VideoWriter).  Then, I could use this video to extract frames (deeplabcut.extract_frames).  Using the frame numbers from this  extract step, I could replace these frames with the original frames (changing the name to have \"img%5d.png\" ).  This way I could have the original uncompressed images to label.  \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBeyond this, it would be very useful to create the training dataset and train the network using the original images.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
