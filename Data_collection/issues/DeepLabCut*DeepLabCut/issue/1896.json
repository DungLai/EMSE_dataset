Please describe.**\r\nI'm interested in passing a minimal dataset to a colleague similar to the demo datasets, who will make adjustments and either continue training or analyze videos. I was experimenting with `load_demo_data` as a way for them to quickly add absolute paths, and possibly regenerate `training-datasets`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n1. Expanded the use of `load_demo_data` to allow additional datasets, particularly `transform_data` [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/create_project/demo_data.py#L54-L60) to permit a list of relative path videos, expanded with the config root directory. \r\n2. Or, change [this print statement](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/create_project/demo_data.py#L60) to `raise Exception`. At present, the next line raises an ambiguous error for unofficial datasets:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'video_file' referenced before assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're interested in a PR\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Asking recipients to manually edit config files with destination absolute paths.\r\n2. Writing my own script to pass to the colleague with similar config-editing functionality.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
