Run deeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config_file)\r\n2. In the GUI, load data, refine all frames, save, and click yes for repeating.\r\n3. In the second data, refine the labels in the first frame, and go to the next frame. Go back to the first frame, and the labels were messed up and not at the manually refined positions.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe previous data's last frame labels are not cleared, still remained, and affect to the next data's 1st frame. This issue consecutively happens - second data's last frame affects the third data's first frame, etc - during keep clicking yes for the repeating refining. Maybe the GUI issue.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24601048/80803260-9c188880-8b66-11ea-82a1-11dbac465edf.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.1.6.2\r\n - Browser: both in chrome & edge\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt did not happen when I refine data separately (close the GUI and re-run deeplabcut.refine_labels),  not repeated in the same GUI.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/670/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
