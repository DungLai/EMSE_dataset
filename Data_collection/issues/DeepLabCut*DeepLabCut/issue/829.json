Open GUI with python -m deeplabcut\r\n2. load a video that contains a period (.) in the name, excluding the extension. We had a multi-animal project.\r\n  example \"this.is.a.filename.mp4\"\r\n3. extract and label frames\r\n4. create a training dataset\r\n5. Attempt to start training (resnet-50)\r\n\r\nWe experienced an issue where this video could not be trained with a video filename containing periods.\r\n\r\n6. We renamed the video to exclude the periods\r\n example \"thisisafilename.mp4\"\r\nWe also renamed the folder names and everything related to that.\r\n\r\n7. labels cannot be adjusted, and training is \r\n\r\nFrom here on it causes many issues which we resolved by adjusting the paths in the labeleddata.csv for that file, deleting the .h5 file, calling deeplabcut.convertcsv2h5(config) and relaunching. \r\n\r\nWe propose that videos with periods (if that is the issue is caused by periods in the filename) that the program refuses the video with this format to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hobbitsyfeet","id":11593824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet","html_url":"https://github.com/hobbitsyfeet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobbitsyfeet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
