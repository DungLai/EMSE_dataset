Otherwise with the trailpoints and save_frames on, it works fine. \r\n\r\nI thought that the main issue might be how the skeleton is defined in the config.yaml file. I have tried various ways of writing this skeleton. This is what the current version looks like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42900802/72384847-42419f00-36ec-11ea-85de-128ad374debd.png)\r\n\r\nThings I have tried to resolve this:\r\n1. Adding commas to the skeleton layout:\r\nFrom    - - Head       ----->          - - 'Head'\r\nor removing the empty line between the consecutive pairs.\r\n\r\n2. I tried converting the skeleton to a list of the form: [['Head','Neck'],['Neck','rArm'],['Neck','lArm'],['Neck','Hip'],['rKnee','Hip'],['lKnee','Hip']]. Doing this destroys the config.yaml file. DLC won't accpet it. \r\n     \r\nAlso tried putting in spaces between the sublists in this list:\r\n[['Head','Neck'],['Neck','rArm']] ----> [['Head','Neck'], ['Neck','rArm']] \r\n     \r\n\r\nand removing the commas around the elements \r\n[['Head,'Neck'],['Neck','rArm']] ----> [[Head,Neck],[Neck,rArm]]\r\n\r\nNone of them work.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
