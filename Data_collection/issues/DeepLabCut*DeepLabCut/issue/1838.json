I did it by using the function convertcsv2h5, but it turns out to have bug when in `data.columns = data.columns.set_levels([scorer], level='scorer')` where the error looks like `ValueError: On level 0, code max (2) >= length of level (1). NOTE: this index is in an inconsistent state\r\n`\r\nI've noticed that in the csv file, there's no inputs from B1 to C3, and I thought it to be the problem. When I added scorer name to the file, it works for this line, but the h5 file structure actually changed so that deeplabcut can not read it. The h5 keys before looks like `<KeysViewHDF5 ['axis0_label0', 'axis0_label1', 'axis0_label2', 'axis0_level0', 'axis0_level1', 'axis0_level2', 'axis1_label0', 'axis1_label1', 'axis1_label2', 'axis1_level0', 'axis1_level1', 'axis1_level2', 'block0_items_label0', 'block0_items_label1', 'block0_items_label2', 'block0_items_level0', 'block0_items_level1', 'block0_items_level2', 'block0_values']>` while after the change, it looks like `<KeysViewHDF5 ['axis0_label0', 'axis0_label1', 'axis0_label2', 'axis0_level0', 'axis0_level1', 'axis0_level2', 'axis1', 'block0_items_label0', 'block0_items_label1', 'block0_items_label2', 'block0_items_level0', 'block0_items_level1', 'block0_items_level2', 'block0_values', 'block1_items_label0', 'block1_items_label1', 'block1_items_label2', 'block1_items_level0', 'block1_items_level1', 'block1_items_level2', 'block1_values']>`\r\n\r\nIf simply comment out the set_level function, the h5 file structure will also be changes, which can also be noticed from the csv file, 'unnamed' will be inserted into B1-C3.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"xirechen","id":105749496,"node_id":"U_kgDOBk2b-A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105749496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen","html_url":"https://github.com/xirechen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xirechen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
