There are multiple (3) mice in my footage that are quite indistinguishable from each other. I don't mind only parameterising one of them, however the issue is that a body part, say, the 'left ear' of one mouse may flicker between one mouse to another. What is the best way to handle this such that I can stay consistently with the same subject?\r\n\r\nYour preprint does suggest using an autoregressive model to extract, and add to the training set, frames where the position has changed by > epsilon pixels but it is not an issue of the accuracy of the network as they are indistinguishable to the human eye- the model does a great job- and thus at labelling stage it is also impossible to be sure that I am consistently labelling the same mouse. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnthony","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
