Follow the steps in \"Demo_yourowndata.ipynb\"\r\n2. Use \"%gui wx\" and \"deeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config_file)\" to refine labels.\r\n3. In the GUI, refine the labels in the first frame, and go to the next frame.\r\n4. Go back to the first frame, and the labels were messed up and not at the manually refined positions.\r\n5. This can be seen from the labeled images after using \"deeplabcut.check_labels(path_config_file)\".\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.0.5.1\r\n - Browser: Firefox\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI tried using another computer (Ubuntu 14.04) with an earlier version of DeepLabCut (2.0.2.1) and the issue did not occur.
