I followed what was suggested in previous posts, ie. save the videos using a video editor in a different format (used premier pro and ffmpeg to do this), and checked the integrity of the video and it created an empty log file. I also checked the assemblies pickle file and it is empty. I am unsure what the problem is and it would be wonderful to get some help regarding this issue. \r\n\r\nIf required, I can share a google drive link with the video in question, integrity check log files and the pickle files.\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 20.04\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version 2.2\r\n\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\ndeeplabcut GUI\r\n1. select videos \r\n2.
