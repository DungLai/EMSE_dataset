However, I noticed when I run evaluate network the colors don't match between the predictions and human labels. I have encountered this issue in 2.1.7 see [here](https://forum.image.sc/t/label-mismatch-between-plotted-labeled-frames-and-plotted-evaluation-results/37777) and [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/689). I think I am running into a similar problem with 2.2b8. In 2.17 this issue was caused by changing the bodypart order in the config.yaml after adding new labels. This does not happen when I use the same labeled frames in 2.1.8.2\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.2b8\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: maDLC \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n\r\ncode used: `deeplabcut.evaluate_network(config_path,plotting=True)`\r\nno error see below screenshots:\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22876046/94756373-640bb080-0365-11eb-96ba-428808a4a18e.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn the screenshot you see that the colors of the human labels and the predictions don't match. The ones that match are 3-4 bodyparts that stayed in the same order since I first created the project.
