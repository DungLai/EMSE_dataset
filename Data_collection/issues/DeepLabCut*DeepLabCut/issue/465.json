I am not sure which notebook I should use first as there is so many and I am kinda lost as a starter.\r\n\r\n1. I have expert annotations for my dataset. I am wondering how I could directly feed them into training rather than annotating the dataset myself?\r\n2. How can I also not use any expert annotation and say annotate 10 frames on my own so that the DeepLabCut could use them for training?\r\n\r\nHere is the keypoint file: http://www.cs.bu.edu/~betke/research/HRMF/cam1_annotations_pts.txt Here is the images in PNG format: http://www.cs.bu.edu/~betke/research/HRMF/Cam1_Images.zip\r\n\r\nEach line of my annotated data is like:\r\n1.0000 494.5551 234.2510 711.6219 274.2668 481.7198 299.5598 311.0864 339.5756\r\n\r\nwhere 1.0000 represents the frame number, followed by x and y for 4 key points of a moth.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you might have any questions.\r\n\r\nRight now I am running Colab_DEMO_mouse_openfield.ipynb in Google Colab but I don't honestly need to use Cloud GPU/TPUs as I have my own deep learning server. As long as I can figure how to go with annotating my own data would be awesome. I have my data both in JPEG and png format as well as a video in AVI format.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
