Firstly `yaml.load` without the use of a loader function has depreciated and requires to be replaced by one of the loaders detailed [here](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/wiki/PyYAML-yaml.load(input)-Deprecation). I have already made the edits to solve this issue. However, the `cfg` variable does not load correctly. While it does produce a dictionary,  all the keys are incorrect. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the following dictionary is produced \r\n```\r\n['__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'clear', 'copy', 'fromkeys', 'get', 'items', 'keys', 'pop', 'popitem', 'setdefault', 'update', 'values']\r\n````\r\n\r\ninstead of the dictionary that one would expect form the `config.yaml` file. \r\n\r\nThe following error is also produced:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-4-4a24d99ed957> in <module>()\r\n      5 path_config_file = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\jcdea\\\\OneDrive\\\\Bath\\\\Animal_Pose_Estimation\\\\DeepLab_trial\\\\Reaching-Jake-2019-03-12\\\\config.yaml\"\r\n      6 #print(path_config_file)\r\n----> 7 deeplabcut.extract_frames(path_config_file,'automatic','uniform',crop=True)\r\n      8 \r\n      9 #there are other ways to grab frames, such as by clustering 'kmeans'; please see the paper.\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\jcdea\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\generate_training_dataset\\frame_extraction.py in extract_frames(config, mode, algo, crop, userfeedback, cluster_step, cluster_resizewidth, cluster_color, opencv)\r\n    110 \r\n    111         # Check for variable correctness\r\n--> 112         if start>1 or stop>1 or start<0 or stop<0 or start>=stop:\r\n    113             raise Exception(\"Erroneous start or stop values.

Replace `yaml.load(cfg)` in **frame_extraction.py ** with `yaml.load(ymlfile, Loader=)` with `Loader` is specified using one of the Loaders in the above link. \r\n2. Add `print(dir(cfg))` in just after `print(\"Config file read successfully.\")` to check the output of the `cfg` dictionary. \r\n3. Run `deeplabcut.extract_frames` using the `config.yaml` file created using `deeplabcut.create_new_project`\r\n4. This produces the errors above (with some changes in the outputted dictionary due to the different loaders) \r\n\r\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Gaelic98","id":33144206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTQ0MjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33144206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98","html_url":"https://github.com/Gaelic98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gaelic98/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
