Please describe.**\r\nIt seems most users waste 1-10 hours installing DLC. I don't see any technical issues that prevent a similar system to work as a homepage with HTML5 using TensorFlow.js. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHomepage allow video upload (or recording w/ camera from smartphone) and subsequent labeling. Then trains model and allow sharing trained model through link. Opening the link automatically opens camera on smartphone and runs mobilenet version of model for live tracking. \r\n\r\nEmphasis: this will save users hours of time failing to install dependencies AND allow users with no tech savvy.\r\n\r\nEmphasis: this is surprisingly easy to do with HTML5.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm going to write this myself when I get ~3 weeks free time. I have to write thesis, grant proposal and do an internship the next few months, but I expect to find time on weekends to finish this before September. \r\n\r\nI write here to\r\n- Hear any concerns for developing such system\r\n- Make sure this is not already being developed so i waste my time.\r\n- Find people to discuss the system with. \r\n- Discuss idea to reduce training time to ~10seconds using linear algebra trick and a novel data augmentation.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
