I searched the docs/issues and found suggestions that re-installing `ffmpeg` may be necessary for some users on Windows. I am using Linux, but tried reinstalling `ffmpeg` anyways. It had no effect. \r\n\r\nSo far it _seems_ as if each step is still completing without practical consequences, but of course I can't be sure... \r\n\r\nMy colleague said: \"I looked up the error message.  The page I found points to trying to use a media codec inside of a media container that doesn't support it. ffmpeg is usually smart enough to pick a reasonable codec for a given container on its own, so I'm guessing that's why it's working even with the error. I have another theory though: Is there an audio track with these video files? [If not], Then it's possible the codec it's rejecting is the audio codec, which (given the message about a 'partial file') may just be a stub with no usable audio content.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, these files are mp4 containers with H264 codecs, and no audio track. They are generated by [e3vision](https://white-matter.com/products/e3vision/) cameras. \n\n### Operating System\n\nUbunutu 20.04.4 LTS\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGPU: NVidia Tesla V100 32GB GPU\r\nCPU: 224-core Intel Xeon Platinum 8276M (Skylake, x86_64).\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nEnvironment: [dlc_env.yaml](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/8961236/dlc_env.txt)\r\nConfig: [config.yaml](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/8961238/config.txt)\r\nRun: deeplabcut.analyze_videos()\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
