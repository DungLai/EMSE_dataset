Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI am at the stage of training and on colab I can see clearly the iterations and losses.\r\nHowever I asked to save every 500 iterations and despite the fact that is doesn't save all (it stopped saving on 2500), I only get the snapshot-XXX.index files, I do not get snapshot-XXXX.data-00000-of-00001 or the .meta files.\r\n![Screenshot 2021-08-20 at 15 10
