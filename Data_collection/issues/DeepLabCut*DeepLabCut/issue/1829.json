I am running DLC in a Jupyter notebook, deeplabcut.analyze_videos works well, and I can even use the plot_trajectories command to generate plots for a specific video.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run deeplabcut.create_labeled_video, it does not create a video. It runs for a few seconds with no output whatsoever, but generates nothing. If I specify dest_folder, it will even create that folder, but no video is created inside it.\r\n\r\nHowever, referencing the same config and video from the GUI will generate labelled videos.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 11\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nRTX 3090\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Activate standard DLC conda env and open ipython terminal.\r\n2. Open Jupyter Notebook.\r\n3. Analyze DLC videos.\r\n4. Run deeplabcut.create_labeled_video\r\n5. For comparison, run in GUI, which works.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nThere is none\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"chris-angeloni","id":3865975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjU5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3865975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni","html_url":"https://github.com/chris-angeloni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-angeloni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
