I have an issue when trying to analyze a two-animal project 2h videos on Google Colab. It's RAM overloads when converting the analysis to pickle files, regardless of video file format and number of videos analyzed simultaneously (it crashes when converting the pickle files for the first video). I was able to solve it by splitting the videos into several 15 min videos, but it is very time consuming and I have many videos to work with. I understand this is not a DLC issue but a Colab one, however I'm not based in the US so I can't sign up for a pro license. My available machines have less RAM than Colab so it's impractical to run the analysis on DLC's GUI. Do you have any suggestions on how to proceed?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nLucas Boldrini.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
