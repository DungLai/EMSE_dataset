I run into an issue when using `deeplabcut.convertannotationdata_fromwindows2unixstyle`. However the function does not find the generate the correct list of folders to loop through the annotations and change the format. \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: MacOS Catalina\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.1.10.4\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: single\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\nrun `deeplabcut.convertannotationdata_fromwindows2unixstyle(config_path,userfeedback=True, win2linux=True)`\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nDo you want to convert the annotationdata in folder: /Users/mehmetkeles/Desktop/DLC_Project_Files/LiquidFoodDLC-Mehmet-2020-03-23/labeled-data/D:\\DLC_Sleep\\LiquidFood\\20200304_Fly2_30FPS_LiquidFood\\Fly2-03042020151948-0002 ?\r\nyes/noyes\r\n/Users/mehmetkeles/opt/anaconda3/envs/tDLC/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/utils/conversioncode.py:63: UserWarning: Could not find '/Users/mehmetkeles/Desktop/DLC_Project_Files/LiquidFoodDLC-Mehmet-2020-03-23/labeled-data/D:\\DLC_Sleep\\LiquidFood\\20200304_Fly2_30FPS_LiquidFood\\Fly2-03042020151948-0002/CollectedData_Mehmet.h5'. skipping\r\n  warnings.warn(f\"Could not find '{fn+'.h5'}'. skipping\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nthe function grabs the config folder combines it with `/labeled data/` but does not split windows paths since os.path.split is run on MacOS. So instead of splitting `D:\\DLC_Sleep\\LiquidFood\\fly2` to just `fly2` it leaves it as is and combines it with the config path + `/labeled_data/`. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI am sorry if I am missing something trivial here. I guess I maybe could run the function in windows then move the folder to macos but seemed a little counter intuitive. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
