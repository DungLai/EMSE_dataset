Further, when run with save_as_csv set to True, again no file is created. My understanding is that this function should create a file in the same directory as the video? \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![DeepLabCut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38668004/55029410-fea06c00-4fd7-11e9-9718-9e1e3deee057.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNetwork training was completed on Google Colab, snapshots were created in increments of roughly 40,000 until a total of 200,000 had been completed. Network evaluation completed with a train pixel error of 1.24 and test error of 5.89. The snapshot being called is not the 'latest' snapshot as the cumulative training on Google Colab finished at a snapshot number (which reset each time) that was smaller than the 'latest'.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
