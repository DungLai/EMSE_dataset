Thank you very much for your excellent work. I am currently using the Nature Neuroscience version (v1.1) but will get around to checking out the newer version soon.\r\n\r\nFor now, I would like to ask a question regarding multiple feature and pose prediction. From one closed issue, it was explained that line 28 from pose-tensorflow/nnet/predict.py can be modified to change the number of body parts to be identified. \r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/1.11/pose-tensorflow/nnet/predict.py#L28\r\nIf I'm not mistaken the exact line is as follows: \r\n`scmap = outputs_np[0]`\r\n\r\nI understand that outputs_np[0] returns the best peak for a particular feature at a time (i.e. nose), however I'm not sure how to get the 2 or 3 highest peaks. If it is changed to: \r\n`scmap = outputs_np[1]` \r\nit should just return the second highest peak. Thus, should it be something like \r\n`scmap = outputs_np[0], outputs_np[1]`? Or instantiating a separate variable like\r\n`scmap1 = outputs_np[0], scmap1 = outputs_np[1]`\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n-Dean","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
