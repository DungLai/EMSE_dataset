I complete all the correct steps, but when I get to the Analyze step, it only analyzes the first couple seconds of the video, but nothing after that. This is an issue that has popped up multiple times and I haven't gotten an answer as to what the issue could be. My video has 22287 total frames, but only 58 of them are detected.
