The error is repeating after X-val or creating tracklet files. \r\n\r\n - OS: Windows10 \r\n - DLC-GPU deeplabcut2.2b8 \r\n - multi-animal tracking\r\n - ms edge\r\n\r\nI've created a test training set for 3-animals tracking in one consistent context, created 50 labeling files with 1 video, and ran the 1st training without cropping. After the 1st training, I found tracking errors in the result tracklet video, and added the crop option, and ran the 2nd training with the same iteration index, which did not cause any problem until tracklet creation. Since I found the tracking wasn't still satisfying yet, so that I increased skeleton connections, and ran the training again with same iteration index, which start causing key error '5_9' during X-validation and the tracklet creation. Also, when I re-ran with increased labeling frames, and training went well without any problems but the same key error is still there during X-val. \r\n\r\n![error_key5_9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75436015/101258357-f165db00-36ef-11eb-8896-cd0665c0997c.PNG)\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea which part of my process caused this error?\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"deepbraincut","id":75436015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDM2MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75436015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut","html_url":"https://github.com/deepbraincut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepbraincut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
