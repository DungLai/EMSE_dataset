I have been following the video located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s) but the program keeps crashing and I keep getting \"FileNotFoundError\" errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I run pythonw testscript.py, I get a series of error messages. The last one and also the one that end my run in an error is\r\n```python\r\nRELABELING\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"testscript.py\", line 228, in <module>\r\n    DF = pd.read_hdf(file, \"df_with_missing\")\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/DLC-CPU/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/io/pytables.py\", line 387, in read_hdf\r\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"File {path_or_buf} does not exist\")\r\nFileNotFoundError: File /Users/shawtylow/Desktop/DLCTest/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-02-04/labeled-data/reachingvideo1short/machinelabels-iter0.h5 does not exist\r\n```\r\nI also get \"No video(s)\" were found errors at other stages of this program but it doesn't seem to kill it.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. install anaconda\r\n2. git clone deeplabcut \r\n3. create the dlc-cpu environment\r\n4. activate this environment\r\n5. cd into deeplabcut/examples\r\n6. run \"pythonw testscript.py\"\r\n7. wait for error\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"1194\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 8 29 38 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47653762/106977237-eea35880-6727-11eb-9178-f249cf372f61.png\">\r\nHere is what my terminal output looks like right before crashing\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nIt appears to me that testscript.py is responsible for creating all these files since they are not on the original GitHub. Am I correct in believing this?\r\nAlso, the first thing to be missing is reachingvideo1short. That directory does not appear under labeled-data.\r\nThanks so much!","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
