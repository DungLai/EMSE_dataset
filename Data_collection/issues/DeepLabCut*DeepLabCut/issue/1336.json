While the code is running it works fine (all the files are created in the appropriate location), and there is no error log in the jupyter notebook code. I tried to downgrade to CUDA 9, and appropriate driver, and resintalling deeplabcut, but that did not solve the issue. Finally I tried to reduce the global scale to 0.6, suspecting that the issue is that the network is using too much GPU power. But again no success. \r\nI tried to use the same dlc model on a different desktop and it works fine, so I think the issue is in the communication between dlc and the GPUs in my desktop. But I am running out of ideas at this point. Does anyone have some suggestion on what the issue might be? \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
