I'm working with mice and tested DeepLabCut on Ethovision (Noldus) tracking videos (.mp4) and it works perfectly. But, because I prefer working with open-source, I'm also working with a Raspberry Pi and the PiCamera v2. Videos are saved in .h264 and I cannot change that. I would like to use DeepLabCut with these videos but it seems that DeepLabCut doesn't like this format. There is a problem in frame_extraction.py. Metadata are not well extracted (framerate, number of frames, duration). Have you ever seen this problem? \r\n\r\nIf I convert these .h264 videos with MP4Box (.mp4), DeepLabCut works. But I don't really like the idea of conversion.\r\n\r\nI know that OpenCv is able to deal with .h264 because I made a script to do mice paws tracking and it works.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nBest,\r\nAmandine Cornil\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
