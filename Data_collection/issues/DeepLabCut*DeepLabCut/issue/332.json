DeepLabCut 2.0.6.3\r\n\r\nWhen following the deeplabcut demos (Reaching Mackenzie, Open Field, Demo Your Own Data), I keep running into the issue of not having any images after using extract_frames (both automatically and manually). \r\n\r\n**Specifically for 'reaching mackenzie, open field':**\r\ndeeplabcut.check_labels(path_config_file) does not produce images with labels as the tutorial assumes and displays the message (not an error): \r\n\r\nCreating images with labels by Mackenzie.\r\nC:\\Users\\Toma\\Documents\\DLC2019\\DeepLabCut\\examples\\Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30\\labeled-data\\reachingvideo1_labeled  already exists!\r\nThey are stored in the following folder: C:\\Users\\Toma\\Documents\\DLC2019\\DeepLabCut\\examples\\Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30\\labeled-data\\reachingvideo1_labeled.\r\nAttention: C:\\Users\\Toma\\Documents\\DLC2019\\DeepLabCut\\examples\\Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30\\labeled-data\\reachingvideo1 does not appear to have labeled data!\r\n\r\nThe images are not stored in the labeled-data folder but does not throw out an error, just an Attention PSA.\r\n\r\n**Specifically for 'your own data':**\r\nThe video file path is correct in the config.yaml and the extracting process works fine using the GUI:\r\nIn [7]: deeplabcut.extract_frames(path_config_file,'manual')\r\nQuitting for now!\r\n\r\nFrames were selected.\r\nYou can now label the frames using the function 'label_frames' (if you extracted enough frames for all videos).\r\n\r\nBut when going to label the data, there are no images in the labeled_data folder. There are no errors and I am stuck.\r\n\r\nAny insight helps, thanks,\r\nToma\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tomaitagaki","id":45250757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjUwNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45250757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki","html_url":"https://github.com/tomaitagaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaitagaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
