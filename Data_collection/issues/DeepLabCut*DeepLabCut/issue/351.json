Then I evaluated the network.\r\n\r\nThe first time I did this (before re-training), a folder called \"LabeledImages_DeepCut_resnet50_TrackHydraJun18shuffle1_1030000_snapshot-1030000\" was created under \"evaluation-results > iteration 0.  However when I re-trained and evaluated the network, it does not create the folder even with plotting=True parameter. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52329772/60619161-a7abef00-9d9d-11e9-8ce6-a702aaf9cca3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52329772/60619782-002fbc00-9d9f-11e9-811a-73e86650ce46.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I cannot see the labeled data.\r\n\r\n2. \r\nAlso, when I try to re-analyze the videos using the re-trained network, it gives me a message saying \"this video has already been analyzed\" so it doesn't re-analyze it. After executing \"create_labeled_video\" command   I checked the folder, but the labeled videos are all the videos from before and not the newly labeled videos.\r\n\r\nHow could I fix this? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
