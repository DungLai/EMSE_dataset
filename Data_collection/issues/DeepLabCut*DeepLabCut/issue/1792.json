This is because it seems that they get shuffled during the collection/discovery step.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you look at your folder, the results start to appear in a random order. I would like to look down my folder list in my file explorer and see the videos get analyzed in some kind of order.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like a call to `videos.sort()` to sort the list of videos found so they get \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nPatching deeplabcut myself, I would rather collobarate and submit the patch to you to help other users.\r\n\r\nAttached is one non-invasive suggestion.
