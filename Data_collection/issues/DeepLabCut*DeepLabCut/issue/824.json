However deeplabcut has no tool to extract frames while viewing the labeled frame. \r\n\r\nOne major problem is that frames that appear quite similar to humans (and happen near each other) may have differences that cause the model to make very different predictions. Meaning that not saving the exact frame where incorrect predictions are made may cause irrelevant frames to be saved (ones that are predicted correctly). Another is that it's time-consuming to convert seconds from a video player (for viewing the labeled video) to an approximate frame, and then try to find the exact point using code or the DLC frame extractor. For high FPS videos with fast movements, a 1-second resolution may cause you to search up to 120 frames. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAdd the ability to see labeled data when extracting unlabeled frames\r\n\r\n## Alternatives considered\r\nAs described above, the best available alternative right now seems to be viewing the labeled videos and manually converting the time to frames and then attempting to find the frame using the frame-extractor or code. However there are problems with this method and it is inconvenient.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nas an aside, if I need this feature sooner than others can get around to it and make it myself- would it be useful as a contribution?","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
