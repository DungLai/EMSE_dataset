Fixed with updating Pillow from 7.1.1 to 7.1.2 (pip install --upgrade Pillow). Should be fine with new env installs, but may want to require Pillow >=7.1.2 in setup.py.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. From within a previous deeplabcut conda env, pip install deeplabcut==2.2b5\r\n2. Make a project in GUI, label frames, click either \"Check Labels\" button. \r\n3. Labeled folder created, but no labeled images\r\n3.
