I am new to using Anaconda environments and never used deeplabcut before or python.\r\n\r\n**Operating system**  **DeepLabCut version**\r\n\r\nOS: macOS Catalina version 10.15.7\r\nDeepLabCut Version: not installed yet\r\nAnaconda env used: anaconda 3.\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nI have installed DLC-CPU.yaml in the Anaconda 3 environment following the tutorial detailed here https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md. I entered the environment and run pythonw to import deeplabcut. I got a message error: ImportError: No module named deeplabcut (see below)\r\n\r\n**Terminal output with pythonw:**\r\n\r\n>(base) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ conda activate DLC-CPU\r\n>(DLC-CPU) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ pythonw\r\n\r\n>WARNING: Python 2.7 is not recommended. \r\n>This version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. \r\n>Future versions of macOS will not include Python 2.7. \r\n>Instead, it is recommended that you transition to using 'python3' from within >Terminal.\r\n\r\n>Python 2.7.16 (default, Jun  5 2020, 22:59:21) \r\n>[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.29.20) >(-macos10.15-objc- on darwin\r\n>Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import deeplabcut\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nImportError: No module named deeplabcut\r\n>>> \r\n\r\nI tried the following command to identify the path for pythonw:\r\n\r\n>(base) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ which pythonw\r\n>/Users/sbaudouin/opt/anaconda3/bin/pythonw\r\n>(base) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ \r\n\r\nI assume that the path should be correct at it uses the anaconda 3 environment but somehow the system is using python 2.7 and not python 3.\r\n\r\nI wanted to check which version of python would be triggered if I type python instead of pythonw in the DLC-CPU environment. I was also curious to see if the import/launch of deeplabcut would work and it does not (unsurprisingly). Here is what I got:\r\n\r\n**Terminal output with python:**\r\n\r\n>(base) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ conda activate DLC-CPU\r\n>(DLC-CPU) stal-lt04:~ sbaudouin$ python\r\n>Python 3.7.10 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 19 2021, 15:59:12) \r\n>[Clang 11.0.1 ] on darwin\r\n>Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import deeplabcut\r\n>>> deeplabcut.launch_dlc()\r\nThis program needs access to the screen.

As I understand, python 3 should be built in the anaconda 3 environment. I do not know how to address this problem further, so if you have some suggestions I would be very happy to read them.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nSt√©phane\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
