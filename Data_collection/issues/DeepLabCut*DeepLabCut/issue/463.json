I downloaded it from git ~Oct. 24 2019.\r\n\r\nSee screen shots below that capture what I describe.\r\n\r\nSimilar to issue #303, my terminal gets stuck on \"Starting training...\". After about an hour of running, ipython stops without error. Based on the suggestions for issue #303, I checked to make sure the weights had been downloaded and were in the proper location, and they are. \r\n\r\nI adjusted the display_iters parameter from 1000 to 100 and reran the training. I can see that the training is running, but after about an hour (~900 iterations), ipython stops without error. I tried to evaluate the network, but I got an error saying that it hadn't been trained.\r\n\r\nSo, I adjusted save_iters to 100. Now, when I evaluate the network, the evaluation runs. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm only able to get about 900 iterations completed because ipython (or something else) times out. Obviously, this is not ideal. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to fix this issue? I did a bit of searching for ipython time out errors, but I couldn't find much. Admittedly, I'm new to python, so perhaps I've just missed the answer. I'd greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks!\r\n\r\n~Nick\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38138179/67709683-ceb5ae80-f994-11e9-8100-e3fc2317a731.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38138179/67709702-dc6b3400-f994-11e9-8064-a2a97d09972e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38138179/67709724-e68d3280-f994-11e9-9833-ad37e4bae837.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
