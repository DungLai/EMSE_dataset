Load a video or several\r\n3. check the \"do you want to copy the videos\" box\r\n4. Check the Yes radio button\r\n5. Click ok\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFull video files in the videos folder, and proper paths in config.yaml\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: macOS 10.15.2\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nlines 104-105\r\n\r\nIs this it on lines 104-105 of create_new_project.py?
