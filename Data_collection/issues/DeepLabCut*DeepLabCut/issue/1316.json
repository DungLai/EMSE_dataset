All labels are displayed correctly in the GUI.\r\n(200000 iterations, ellipse)\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the videos also seems to work, but in the output folder I only get the \"meta.pickle\" and \"full.pickle\" but no csv or .h5 output. What could be the reason for this? The csv/h5 files are only displayed after the refinement. \r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n1) click on \"Analyze Video\" \r\n2) load config.yaml\r\n3) load video file (.mpg)\r\noutput =  meta/full.pickle\r\n4) Convert to tracklets\r\noutput = _el.pickle (used for refinement)\r\n5) checking for csv in folder failed\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![ANALYZING](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121531439-b0cc7e80-c9fe-11eb-94e7-f140a694fe2d.jpg)\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121531436-b033e800-c9fe-11eb-9cd5-eabd3b9d17ba.jpg)\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121531434-b033e800-c9fe-11eb-808c-ee87734418ce.jpg)\r\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66160679/121531429-af02bb00-c9fe-11eb-96a0-c7d9c32d74de.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
