I just did a refinement (I relabeled 3 videos) and trained my network again (40'000 iterations). After evaluation the refined network, I recognized that my train and test errors are almost 4x as high as after the first training (approx. 2'000000 iterations). I am not sure if I did something wrong when refining and merging my datasets or if I just don't understand the technical basics of the refinement and the corresponding evaluation..? \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!
