The printed result (computed in lines 150-151) is then the arithmetic mean of the `MSE` variable (or a subset of indices).\r\n\r\nIt seems that this computes the arithmetic mean of the euclidean distances between the predicted and ground truth positions, while what actually should be computed according to [the definition of RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) is the **quadratic mean**.\r\n\r\nMore closely: let `x1` and `y1` denote 1D NumPy arrays containing ground truth coordinates for one bodypart for every frame, and similarly let `x2` and `y2` denote the predicted coordinates. Let's call `RMSE` the value which would be computed by `np.nanmean(MSE.values.flatten())` with the current code (for simplicity, we ignore the train/test set split). Let's also assume there are no NaN values. With this notation, the computation for `MSE` (lines 82-83) may be rewritten as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSE = np.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)\r\n```\r\nThis means `MSE[i]` is the euclidean distance between the ground truth and predicted positions in the `i`-th frame. Now `RMSE` is calculated as `RMSE = np.mean(MSE)`.\r\n\r\nHowever the correct MSE and RMSE should be:\r\n```\r\nMSE_B = (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2\r\nRMSE_B = np.sqrt(np.mean(MSE_B))\r\n```\r\n(the name `MSE_B` is still misleading because it's actually not a *mean*, it's a vector of squared distances)\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it means that the reported RMSE is always lower or equal than the actual one (because QM>=AM)! It is not explicitly said in this code that the printed error supposed be the RMSE, but I [myconfig.py](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/myconfig.py#L115) and the Demo Guide suggests that it is.\r\n\r\nAm I wrong about this?","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
