My DLC version is 2.2.0.6. When I run \r\n`deeplabcut.triangulate(config_path, video_path, filterpredictions=False, videotype='.mp4',save_as_csv=True)`\r\nIt analyzes my videos correctly, however the files (including the .h5 file) have an unsual prefix **_el** example: `camera-1-pochuanDLC_dlcrnetms5_camera1Mar31shuffle1_200000_el.h5`\r\nI deleted that prefix so that the tirangulation function could find it, however now I get the following error: \r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nInput In [10], in <module>\r\n----> 1 deeplabcut.triangulate(config_path, video_path, filterpredictions=False, videotype='.mp4',save_as_csv=True)\r\n\r\nFile ~/.dlc-env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_3d/triangulation.py:302, in triangulate(config, video_path, videotype, filterpredictions, filtertype, gputouse, destfolder, save_as_csv)\r\n  293 if run_triangulate:\r\n  294     #        if len(dataname)>0:\r\n  295     # undistort points for this pair\r\n  296     print(\"Undistorting...\")\r\n  297     (\r\n  298         dataFrame_camera1_undistort,\r\n  299         dataFrame_camera2_undistort,\r\n  300         stereomatrix,\r\n  301         path_stereo_file,\r\n--> 302     ) = undistort_points(\r\n  303         config, dataname, str(cam_names[0] + \"-\" + cam_names[1])\r\n  304     )\r\n  305     if len(dataFrame_camera1_undistort) != len(dataFrame_camera2_undistort):\r\n  306         import warnings\r\n\r\nFile ~/.dlc-env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_3d/triangulation.py:453, in undistort_points(config, dataframe, camera_pair)\r\n  438 \"\"\"\r\n  439 path_undistort = destfolder\r\n  440 filename_cam1 = Path(dataframe[0]).stem\r\n (...)\r\n  449 else:\r\n  450 \"\"\"\r\n  451 if True:\r\n  452     # Create an empty dataFrame to store the undistorted 2d coordinates and likelihood\r\n--> 453     dataframe_cam1 = pd.read_hdf(dataframe[0])\r\n  454     dataframe_cam2 = pd.read_hdf(dataframe[1])\r\n  455     scorer_cam1 = dataframe_cam1.columns.get_level_values(0)[0]\r\n\r\nIndexError: list index out of range \r\n```\r\nWhich I think originates in the multianimal indexing, I am not sure how I could change it since I am not very experienced in how the .h5 file is being read. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I cannot find a lot of info on multianimal 3d tracking.
