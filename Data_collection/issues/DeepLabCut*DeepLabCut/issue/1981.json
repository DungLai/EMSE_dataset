However, this is platform-agnostic issue.\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Follow Install instructions.\r\n2. Check that `numpy >= 1.23` is installed.\r\n3. Run example (`python testscript.py`)\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nNumPy has had `numpy.asscalar()` deprecated since v1.16 and finally removed in v1.23 (see [Release Notes](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.23.0-notes.html?highlight=asscalar#expired-deprecations)).\r\n\r\nQuick fix is to set upper bound in YAML environment definitions (`numpy <1.23`). Better would be to follow [NumPy guidance](https://numpy.org/doc/1.22/reference/generated/numpy.asscalar.html) and replace `numpy.asscalar()` calls with `numpy.ndarray.item()`.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1981/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
