That is, DLC uses Tensorflow so I assume that the result of training is a Tensorflow model.  But where is this model?   I'm not usually a Tensorflow user, so I'm not very knowledgeable there -- I thought that a Tensorflow model would be stored in a *.pb file -- but I don't see that anywhere.  What I would really like to do is to convert the Tensorflow model into an ONNX model - so the inference could be done elsewhere in another software system.   Does anyone know if the model used in DLC is representable in ONNX?   Any tips or pointers to help me on this project?
