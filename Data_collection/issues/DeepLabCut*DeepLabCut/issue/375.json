We are running it on WindowsCPU, and saving every 300 iterations\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Follow the instructions to easy-install for WindowsCPU environment\r\n2. Create project, label frames and create training dataset\r\n3. Run [deeplabcut.train_network(path_config_file,displayiters=100,saveiters=300)]\r\n4. After around 900 iterations: [Error: Kernel restarting. The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Kernel does not seem to restart, and saved variables and imported packages are lost. Needs to be manually restarted and packages reloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"kernelDead2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53270701/61810672-b706e100-ae0d-11e9-9791-965302c46689.PNG\">\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSince it saves every 300 iterations, we can manually ask it to train using the most recent iteration (by changing the pose config file init weights from resnet to current iteration). This is extremely time-consuming since it will fail every few 100 iterations.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/375/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
