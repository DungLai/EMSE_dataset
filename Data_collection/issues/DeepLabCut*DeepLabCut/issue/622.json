I tried to install it this afternoon but i can't resolve my problem : i have the error : DLL load failed : le module spécifié est introuvable (i am french that's why the end of the error is in french).\r\n\r\nOS: [Windows 10]\r\n\r\nI did all the commands : conda env create -f DLC-GPU.yaml , conda activate DLC-GPU ... but when I do ipython and try to import deeplabcut, i have this error. \r\n\r\nI really don't know what to do next, i already tried to remove the environnement, re add it. I also tried doing it witf the CPU version but it does not work. \r\n \r\nDo you have any solutions ? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62348996/76985349-63b74500-6940-11ea-863b-5416b9f244cd.PNG)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
