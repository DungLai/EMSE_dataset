However, the recognition result of my macaque’s body movement video is not that good. \r\n \r\nSecondly, I used the DeepLabCut GUI to create a new project, and then labeled 70 pictures of the macaque’s body joint points (The position and order of the points that I labeled are consistent with the Full_Macaque Model Zoo provided). I want to train a new weight.\r\n \r\nThe question is how can I merge these two weights together? \r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\n\r\n1. Go to GUI and create a new project, then I labeled 70 pictures. (I took a macaque video by myself)\r\n2. I closed the GUI. Then I copied the full_macaque weight and renamed into the picture below\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108730784-d4121180-7566-11eb-87b4-5c7f271b0f76.png)\r\n3. I changed many config path. e.g. the path inside the \"train/pose_cfg.yamal\", \"test/pose_cfg.yaml\"\r\n4. I typed the code below\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731141-39660280-7567-11eb-87b5-db0d1e7a6e14.png)\r\n5.  After I typed “deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file)” I found that the \"init_weights\" changed into “/home/yingxuanshi/.conda/envs/DLC/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt”.\r\nSo I changed this line into “/home/yingxuanshi/DeepLabCut-master/Monkey-test2_skle_help-2021-02-22/dlc-models/iteration-0/MonkeyFeb22-trainset95shuffle1/train/snapshot-1030000”\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731219-4f73c300-7567-11eb-8e80-bb22b3413884.png)\r\n6. Then I typed this blew\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731389-7cc07100-7567-11eb-870d-b8c6b554281b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731423-83e77f00-7567-11eb-82d3-f59ff53eb568.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731446-8944c980-7567-11eb-861a-5365209ce6ea.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731473-8ea21400-7567-11eb-8cb3-f4d37b115aa7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731485-9366c800-7567-11eb-8ec1-ca7c02d28cdb.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731516-9a8dd600-7567-11eb-9efc-592889049999.png)\r\n7. Then I want to analyse the new video, so I opened the GUI and selected picture below\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731674-c01adf80-7567-11eb-9d02-5b1da1ff8c80.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54396039/108731685-c315d000-7567-11eb-9608-1b92bb92d829.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI don't think the final video merge two weights together, I think the final video only use the weight of \"Full_Macaque Model Zoo\". \r\nI tried many times but I do not know how to merge two training weights together and then generate a new weight. \r\n\r\nForgave me, I only set the (maxiters = 1500) this time. \r\nThis is because I set (maxiters = 5000) before and did the same experiment, still can't get a better result.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
