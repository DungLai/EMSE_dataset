OS X 10.15.4\r\nDeepLabCut Version: 2.2b5\r\nAnaconda env used: DLC-CPU\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\n\r\nI am having issues running multiple commands with the new MA Deeplabcut. \r\nAfter training and then refining a video with refine_tracklets to create an .h5 file I ran a few subsequent commands to filter the data, create a labeled video, as well as refine the network.\r\n\r\nWhen I run\r\n`deeplabcut.filterpredictions(config_path,['/Users/Ben/Desktop/DLC_Tracking_2/Multi_Vids-Ben-2020-06-03/videos/N_LLine_A_1_Trimmed.mp4'])`\r\nit returns\r\n`No unfiltered data file found in

True)`\r\nIt creates the video with labeled points, however the points are the original ones, and not the refined ones that I fixed with refine_tracklets. \r\nIt also returns\r\n`No unfiltered data

seems the video has not been analyzed yet, or the video is not found! You can only refine the labels after the a video is analyzed. Please run 'analyze_video' first. Or, please double check your video file path`\r\nThe video has already been analyzed and does exist.\r\n\r\nFinally, running\r\n`deeplabcut.refine_labels(config_path)`\r\nDoes open up a dialog, however there is not a machinelabels.h5 file in the labeled-data folder. \r\n\r\nI am still getting used to MA Deeplabcut, and was wondering if these are working as expected currently. I am hoping to be able to retrain the network with my refined videos. If there is a way to do that with the current setup I would appreciate knowing.
