Please fill out the template completely, including the full \"traceback\" and input code that you ran to hit this error.\r\n\r\n**Your Operating system and DeepLabCut version**\r\nOS: MacOS Big SUR\r\nDeepLabCut Version: DeepLabCut 2.2rc1\r\nAnaconda env used: Anaconda-Navigator\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\nI'm practicing with videos of my cat from my iphone8 (14.4.2 - not sure of the frame information)\r\n\r\nFollowing the provided protocols, I have been able to begin training my network (wahoo), however, my first pass took over 4 days to reach 11,000 iterations when it's suggested to have a min of 50,000. I do think the loss leveled out a bit (not sure what that range of \"plateau\" is). **Ultimately, what are the various ways to speed this process up?** Should it be taking this long on my computer and therefore? If not do I need to switch to using something like google colaboratory or using a different server that can compute at a higher rate? \r\n\r\nAny help with this is greatly appreciated. \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
