Many of my videos use the same name, as the data organisation is largely done at the folder name level, rather than file names. While my config.yaml contains the full paths to all of the videos as expected, the symlinks in the `videos/` folder seem to have overwritten each other so I am only left with 1 for each unique name pointing to the last video added using that name.\r\n\r\nIs this a problem? What purpose do these symlinks have, as they seem to be redundant with the paths in config.yaml?\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.3\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nnvidia gpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThere are no errors, so everything does _appear_ to work as expected. However it could be a hidden problem, such as only extracting frames from only a subset of the videos that I expect them to be extracted from (I don't think I'd notice this easily as my videos all look very similar).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
