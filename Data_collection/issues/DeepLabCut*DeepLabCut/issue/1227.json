I attempted to look at some of the forums that had similar issues, and implemented in the terminal. But I seem to still have the issue. Thank you for your time and really appreciate your help!\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nHello! I am a Mac user trying to download DeepLabCut. I am trying to import DeepLabCut, but I cannot seem to import the program even though the program is downloaded. Here are some of the things I did to attempt debugging. \r\n\r\n1. The OS I was using was Big Sur. I saw on the document that Mojave was recommended. So I downgraded my OS to Mojave. \r\n2. I used environment the document provided. When I could not import DeepLabCut, I deleted the environment and redownloaded the environment. But still had the same issue.\r\n3. Realized that python program needed to be in version 3.6.x, I created custom environment with python version 3.6.8 by conda create -n python368 python=3.6.8. Also, did pip install tensorflow==1.15.0, pip install wxpython==4.0.7.post2, and pip install deeplabcut. Everything went fine but when I tried to import DeepLabCut, I couldn't. \r\n\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is. \r\nPlease provide the minimal required code to reproduce the error and the full output (please edit ONLY the section below that says `PLACE YOUR CODE HERE!!! `.\r\n\r\nconda create -n python368 python=3.6.8\r\nConda activate python368\r\npip install tensorflow==1.15.0\r\npip install wxpython==4.0.7.post2\r\npip install deeplabcut\r\npythonw\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.6, 13-inch, 2017\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.10.4\r\n - Browser Safari\r\n\r\n<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n^do not delete the above \"<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\" or the ```python part!\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nImportError: No module named deeplabcut\r\n\r\ndo not delete below this line, leave the blank line and the ```\r\n\r\n```\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
