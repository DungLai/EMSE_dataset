Whilst I am sure selecting the number of animals may help DeepLabCut detect the individuals, it makes our research slower. Below I will discuss why and I would love your input on how we can streamline the process.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWith our dataset on wild apes, the number of individuals changes with every video. This means I have to sit and manually watch the videos to decide how many are in that particular clip, then reset GUI when this number changes, meaning I cannot just leave DLC to run 'analyze videos' on 100 videos like I used to be able to. This is slowing down our research. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI am guessing telling DLC how many individuals it is expecting allows for better tracking, but is there a way to not have to do this? In an ideal world, the same level of tracking proficiency without having to state the number of individuals would be great! In a realistic world, having the option to just run through 100+ videos at one time would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to consider this and I will look forward to your solutions!\r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\nCharlotte & The Wild Minds Lab\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
