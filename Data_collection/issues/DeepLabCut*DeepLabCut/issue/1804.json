Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Bug description\r\n\r\nWhen we (@isabelperezf) are running `analyze_video` with video files longer than 1 hour (frame size 164 x 180 pixels, 30 fps) in COLAB, the RAM memory rapidly gets used until the environment restarts by itself when it rans out of memory.\r\n\r\nThis sounds similar to #1468, however the proposed solution with `use_shelve=True` did not make any change.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10 COLAB\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\n2.2.1\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut
