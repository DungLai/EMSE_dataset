This most clearly manifests in two ways:\r\n-  Though I have specified a single individual named mouse1 in the config.yaml , the Refine Tracklets GUI has a legend for ind1 and ind2. I have not found any combination of pcutoff, max_age, or max gap size or any other variable that will get me back down to a single mouse, much less a single mouse labeled 'mouse1'.\r\n- At first the \"Number of Animals\" is set to 1. However, if I interact at all with the \"Number of Animals\" box in the Refine tracklets window, the number sets itself to 2 and will not allow to go any lower.\r\n\r\nPlease place code inside this:\r\n\r\n<details><p>\r\n\r\nNothing special happens in the terminal during this issue.\r\n\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Convert single animal project made in DeepLabCut2.1 to multi-animal project, carefully following instructions in convert_maDLC.md\r\n2. Crop images and labels, create multianimal training dataset, train overnight. I ran 200000 iterations because I had to reduce batch size because of my GPU.\r\n3. Use GUI to analyze a test video and convert to tracklets with ellipse\r\n4. Get to Refine tracklets step. Here is where I encountered issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10 07 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9322812/116953919-81d32800-ac5c-11eb-9c12-43b502f1f4e2.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe problem I described above is the proximate issue and may be a legitimate bug. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate issue is that I cannot understand how to get a continuous single-animal location prediction for all frames. I have been searching the gitter and issues extensively. I believe my issue may have similarities with issue #949 or issue #827.\r\n\r\nFor context, evaluating the model produces good values: \r\nAverage Euclidean distance to GT per individual (in pixels)\r\nindividuals\r\nmouse1    2.448599\r\nsingle    2.222496\r\n\r\nThe video created with all detections after analysis looks good to me except there are extraneous labels outside the arena. In particular, the tailbase is nearly constantly labeled. This should be visible and easy for the tracklets to follow, although this is really where my lack of understanding about how pose estimates turn into tracklets really shows.\r\n\r\nMy skeleton is overcomplete but not exhaustive. I see this as a first suggestion on many issues. One thing that is unclear about this is whether you really mean literally that every part should be connected to every other part. If that is so, why not automatically/programmatically do so instead of having user input? I am attaching a screenshot of my skeleton below.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm hoping that tugging on this thread about Refine Tracklets forcing me to have 2 individuals will point me toward the guidance to get back to usable output, which for me is simply a list of xy coordinates with likelihoods for every frame. Since I recently updated to 2.2rc1 I will be trying out a training session with an updated single animal model overnight, though I had understood in my reading that the multi-animal version may serve best even for single animal conditions.\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10 06 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9322812/116953910-767ffc80-ac5c-11eb-92c1-321c1e5e04f5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
