I thought that the DLClight option was supposed to turn that off. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not sure what's going on. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-52d2df9c7fa5> in <module>()\r\n----> 1 import deeplabcut\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/__init__.py in <module>()\r\n     27     else:\r\n     28         mpl.use('Agg')\r\n---> 29     from deeplabcut import generate_training_dataset\r\n     30     from deeplabcut import refine_training_dataset\r\n     31     from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset import label_frames, dropannotationfileentriesduetodeletedimages, comparevideolistsanddatafolders\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/__init__.py in <module>()\r\n     16     pass\r\n     17 else:\r\n---> 18     from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.auxfun_drag_label import *\r\n     19     from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.labeling_toolbox import *\r\n     20     from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.frame_extraction_toolbox import *\r\n\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/auxfun_drag_label.py in <module>()\r\n     17 \r\n     18 import numpy as np\r\n---> 19 import wx\r\n     20 \r\n     21 class DraggablePoint:\r\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wx'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-24 at 12 01 10 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7445362/59992807-32108800-9613-11e9-908a-00c922223e25.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
