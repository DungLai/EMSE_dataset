The initial creation of the project proceeded without issue. The config file has been edited to include the list of body parts I will be labeling and all other sections have been left as is. I received no error messages when extracting frames and can see all of the png images in the labeled data folder.  However, when I use the label frames command and try to load the frames, the labeled data video folders appear empty and I cannot access the images. I have tried deleting the images and extracting the frames again but the same issue occurs. If I select one of the video folders which should have the png files in it and click select folder, the error messages in the attached screenshot appear.  \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!!\r\n\r\nLynnet\r\n\r\ntop of screen\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52416491/60446993-7d68fe80-9bf0-11e9-855f-92b55d24cbda.png)\r\nbottom of screen\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52416491/60447008-878afd00-9bf0-11e9-9408-60ed3d431856.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
