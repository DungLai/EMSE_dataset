I left a network to train overnight, and the GPU is still churning after 12+ hours. Currently it's on iteration 900,000 with a loss of 0.0003. The loss has been oscillating between 0.0003 and 0.0004 for the past 200,000 iterations. I think it should be fine to stop now--it's my first time, so I just wanted a rough idea of how well DLC works before tweaking some parameters.
