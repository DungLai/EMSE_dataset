In issue #944 there was a general outline on what to do to start training with deeplabcutcore and I followed these and got it somehow working. My issue now is though, that the above setup allows me to train but is extremely slow when doing so.\r\nI have another setup with Ubuntu 18.04 and a RTX 2080Ti and this is about 5x faster. Is there some issue with the setup I described above that slows the training process down?\r\n\r\nDuring the installation I noticed a few issues:\r\nJust installing deeplabcutcore with pip will (in my case) led to the error that tensorflow.contrib could not be found. This is why I used the 2.2alpha branch with tf_slim, as described in #1024.\r\nInstalling the tf-nightly-gpu package will lead to a freeze as soon as I import deeplabcutcore (same installation as above). This is why I used tensorflow 2.4.0.\r\n\r\nCan someone who is also using a RTX 3000 card tell me how to properly set this up? I was hoping to speed up the training compared to the other setup.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any suggestions you can give!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
