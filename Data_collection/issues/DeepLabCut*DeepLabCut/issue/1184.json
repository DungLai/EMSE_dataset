DLC Team,\r\n\r\nI encountered the following problem using the current master version of DLC. We labeled several keypoints for two individual animals in a video and trained a multianimal detection model. When visualizing the tracking results using the labeled video, everything seems fine. However, when visualizing the keypoint coordinates obtained from the CSV file, there seem to be a shift/rotation in relation to the original video coordinates. I am attaching a screenshot from the labeled video as well as the plot from our custom visualization script, which both show the same video frame and the individual keypoints plotted. Note that in the lower subplot, I only plot the tailbase and back paw keypoints (the dark blue and yellow markers that can be found in the labeled video), but these clearly seem to be mismatched in relation to the animal body. Is this perhaps a known issue or am I missing some step here? Note that the video has an unusual dimensionality (1024x445 pixels), perhaps this could contribute to the error.\r\nBest regards\r\nPavol\r\n![multianimal_shift](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2625621/114015214-bcb68b80-9869-11eb-89eb-2608d2a8e4f4.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
