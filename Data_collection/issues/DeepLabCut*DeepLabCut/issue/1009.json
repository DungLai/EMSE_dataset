Please describe.**\r\nHi, I'm a freshman for the DeepLabCut. I'm working to label the forelimb when the mouse is doing the lever-press task. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66427267/100125781-1ec4b480-2eb8-11eb-86ae-35d60755b31b.png)\r\nPreviously I've compared multpile networks and hyperparameters to do the labeling. I did 200,000 interations for each, where I labelled 100 frames manually in advance.  My best performance is the following. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66427267/100124802-128c2780-2eb7-11eb-994e-bea8d3f0ccec.png)\r\nThe net_type is **Mobilenet_v2_1.0**, augmenter_type is **default**. \r\nHowever, when I explore the labeling in the video, I found that when the mouse is moving crazily, points could not follow the movement.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSo I extract the outlier frames and retrain the network. To my surprise, I found that the test error increased almost 10 folds.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66427267/100125462-c7bedf80-2eb7-11eb-8084-5086f26e3d54.png)\r\nI cannot figure out what's wrong during the processes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm wondering whether the test error around 7 cannot be reduced anymore. \r\nIs it possible to add skeletons to improve the labeling performance? My postdoc suggests that I could turn to MATLAB to exclude those \"crazy time\" but I haven't equipped myself with that skill. Is it feasible?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI found that there is a new paper titled \"Real-time, low-latency closed-loop feedback using markerless posture tracking\", and I'm wondering whether this new technique could make the improvement. \r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nConfusing Esther ðŸ˜ž ","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
