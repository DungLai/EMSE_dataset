I finally managed, but none of the descriptions really resolved my issues by themselves, I had to resort to multiple resources including some not specific to DLC.\r\n\r\nTo start with, here is how I got actually being able to start the GUI:\r\n```\r\nconda create -n DLC python=3.7\r\nconda activate DLC\r\npip install tensorflow==1.15\r\npip install setuptools==43.0.0\r\npip install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-16.04 wxPython==4.0.7\r\npip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'\r\npython -m deeplabcut\r\n```\r\nI ran into two issues on the way. \r\n\r\n1. Getting wxPython to run. This is kind of linked in the documentation, but in addion, I had to downgrade setuptools. After that wxPython installed, but only from the ubuntu-16.04 repo. Without the -f switch, it fails, and the ubuntu-20.04 repo does not have versions <4.1.0\r\n2. Getting tensorflow to work. This si also why I write this as a bug report. The install instructions explicitly say to make a python 3.8 environment, but as far as I found out, tensorflow 1.15 isn't available for python 3.8, while I had no success with tensorflow>=2. Maybe I am missing something here, but I feel that the install instructions should be either fixed, or extended.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
