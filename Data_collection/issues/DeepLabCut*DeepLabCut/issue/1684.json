Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI followed the instruction to install deeplabcut using docker (which I am familiar with and use with the GPU for other tasks).\r\n\r\nI use the deeplabcut-docker package to start the docker with `deeplabcut-docker gui -v PATH_HOST:PATH_CONTAINER`\r\n\r\nIt seems that the cuda libraries are loaded fine, but when I start the training, the GPU is not found.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to force exposing the gpu using the flag `--gpus all` I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`docker: Error response from daemon: could not select device driver \"\" with capabilities: [[gpu]].`\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nlatest docker container with GUI and jupyter\n\n###
