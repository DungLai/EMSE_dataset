However, my input videos are 1440 * 1080 and when I run the label video command, I get out 1440 * 1080. Is there an internal conversion happening somewhere that converts from 1440p to 640 and back? IE. The network predicts in 640 * 480 and then whenever working with the video, it converts to 1440? This is important for me, since I'm converting to centimeters for kinematics and I need to make sure my conversion factor is the same.
