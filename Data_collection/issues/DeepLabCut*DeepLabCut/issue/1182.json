Now I added some frames to retrain the model and colab crashes again when I run the training. The strange fact is that although I define \"batch size = 1\" in the config file, I still see that it is = 8 when I run the training cell on colab. And so, I still face the resource exhausted error. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"Schermata 2021-04-08 alle 08 23 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886884/113978010-b44b5a00-9843-11eb-8d2f-dd13e403dd0a.png\">\r\n\r\nWhat could I do to fix this issue? \r\nThank you, \r\nBest,\r\nDorian\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
