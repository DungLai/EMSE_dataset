I saw this in the preprint, but did not see it in the documentation.\r\n\r\nBasically, I want to use three cameras that are 60 degrees apart and surrounding the video area. Roughly, it would look like this:\r\n$              Cam 1\r\n$          /            \\\r\n$        /   Mouse   \\\r\n$     /                      \\\r\n$   Cam 2 ________ Cam 3\r\n\r\nI imagine the only way to get all three cameras looking at the checkerboard for calibration is to have them all slightly raised above it, looking down at a small angle. Will that work with the current deeplabcut functions? \r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
