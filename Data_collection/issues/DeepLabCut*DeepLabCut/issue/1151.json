I've been using DLC 2.2b8 for a while and I've encountered an issue with the file naming scheme since updating to v2.1.10.2.\r\n\r\nI first noticed this issue when attempting to manually extract outlier frames from previously analyzed videos using 2.2b8. I would receive the following error in my terminal. \r\n`No unfiltered data file found in D:\\Documents\\Barret-HenziRA\\Vigilence-Calvin-2020-07-02\\videos\\MVI_1917 for video MVI_1917 and scorer DLC_resnet50_VigilenceJul2shuffle1_100000 and box tracker.\r\nIt seems the video has not been analyzed yet, or the video is not found! You can only refine the labels after the a video is analyzed. Please run 'analyze_video' first. Or, please double check your video file path`\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation as to why this might be the case I noticed that the video analysis (in v2.1.10.2) is generating tracker data in files with the following naming convention:\r\n`MVI_1917DLC_resnet_50_VigilenceJul2shuffle1_100000_bx.pickle`\r\n\r\nHowever, the program is looking for files that look like:\r\n`MVI_1917DLC_resnet50_VigilenceJul2shuffle1_100000_bx.pickle`\r\n\r\ni.e there is an extraneous _ placed between resnet and 50. This is preventing previously analyzed videos using 2.2b8 from being analyzed further in v2.1.10.2. After renaming the file and removing the underscore, manual extraction works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Windows10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: v2.1.10.2 (up from v2.2b8)\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: multi-animal tracking\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. Analyze videos using DLC v2.2b8\r\n2. Update DLC to 2.1.10.2\r\n3. Attempt to extract outlier frames (manually) from videos previously analyzed using DLC v2.2b8\r\n\r\n<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n^do not delete the above \"<details><summary>TRACEBACK</summary><p>\" or the ```python part!\r\nNo unfiltered data file found in D:\\Documents\\Barret-HenziRA\\Vigilence-Calvin-2020-07-02\\videos\\MVI_1917 for video MVI_1917 and scorer DLC_resnet50_VigilenceJul2shuffle1_100000 and box tracker.\r\nIt seems the video has not been analyzed yet, or the video is not found!
