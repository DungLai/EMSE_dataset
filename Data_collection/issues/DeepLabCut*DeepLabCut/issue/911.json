The evaluation of this model gave a train error of 2.59 and test error of 4.43 pixels. \r\n\r\n- I analyzed 8 videos with the model, extracted 20 outlier frames from each, using low certainty as the parameter, and corrected the markers for these 160 frames. \r\n\r\n- I appended this data to the original training set and retrained the model using 300,000 iterations. The evaluation of this model gave a train error of 3.02 and test error of 6.79 pixels (actually at the 275,000 iteration checkpoint, which had the best performance). Also, the loss did plateau for the last 40,000 or so iterations: 0.00238, 0.00233, 0.00237, 0.00227. \r\n\r\nIs there some reason why the error would increase after refining the labels? Should I try a different method of extracting outlier frames, such as the jump method, and retrain the model again?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help with this issue!\r\n\r\nBest Wishes,\r\nCaleb","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
