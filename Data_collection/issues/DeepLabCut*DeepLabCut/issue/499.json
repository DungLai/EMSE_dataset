Unfortunately, this cluster uses Red Hat and not Ubuntu, so I haven't been using the provided Ubuntu environment. (I tried using it, but it didn't work.) I was advised by my university's IT staff to try building the environment myself. Unfortunately, that isn't working either, so I thought I would contact you to see if you can provide general directions on how to create the environment. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if I try:\r\n\r\nconda create -n DeepLabCutEnv python=3.6.8 tensorflow=1.13.1 imageio wxpython=4.0.3 matplotlib=3.0.3\r\n\r\nThe environment is created without errors or warnings. Inside the environment, I then run:\r\n\r\npython setup.py install\r\n\r\n(Note, I had to modify a line of the setup.py file. I changed:\r\n'ipython','ipython-genutils','imageio~=2.3.0' ,\r\nto:\r\n'ipython','ipython-genutils','imageio~=2.6.1'\r\nto avoid an error associated with imageio.)\r\n\r\nI do get one error in that process (see below), but it runs to completion, so I think it found a workaround?\r\n\r\nInstalled .../envs/DeepLabCutEnvRN/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests-2.22.0-py3.6.egg\r\nSearching for pyyaml>=5.1\r\nReading https://pypi.org/simple/pyyaml/\r\nDownloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e3/e8/b3212641ee2718d556df0f23f78de8303f068fe29cdaa7a91018849582fe/PyYAML-5.1.2.tar.gz#sha256=01adf0b6c6f61bd11af6e10ca52b7d4057dd0be0343eb9283c878cf3af56aee4\r\nBest match: PyYAML 5.1.2\r\nProcessing PyYAML-5.1.2.tar.gz\r\nWriting /tmp/1457920.s1/easy_install-4qugiixm/PyYAML-5.1.2/setup.cfg\r\nRunning PyYAML-5.1.2/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/1457920.s1/easy_install-4qugiixm/PyYAML-5.1.2/egg-dist-tmp-xsejm5c5\r\nIn file included from ext/_yaml.c:596:0:\r\next/_yaml.h:2:18: fatal error: yaml.h: No such file or directory\r\n #include <yaml.h>\r\n                  ^\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nError compiling module, falling back to pure Python\r\nzip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...\r\nMoving PyYAML-5.1.2-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg to .../envs/DeepLabCutEnvRN/lib/python3.6/site-packages\r\nAdding PyYAML 5.1.2 to easy-install.pth file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, when I attempt to import deeplabcut inside ipython (still in the environment), I get the following error:\r\n\r\nImportError: Cannot load backend 'TkAgg' which requires the 'tk' interactive framework, as 'headless' is currently running\r\n\r\nI've seen in previous issues that this can be fixed with matplotlib=3.0.3, but I already included that in the environment. Furthermore, if I try to go back and install matplotlib=3.0.3 with pip, I get the response that it is already installed. \r\n\r\nI understand that I'm working on a bit of a strange system, but I'd appreciate any advice you can provide. I'm new to python, so I appreciate all the help I can get.
