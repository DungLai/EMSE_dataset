I'm working on [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) backend for DeepLabCut for better efficiency. Currently, I validate integration on https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/testscript_pretrained_models.py. However, I cannot check the accuracy because this sample runs human body estimation model on `reachingvideo1` which is a mouse video. May I ask to share the link to \"human dancing\" video from http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/dlc-modelzoo or can I run a different network on mouse video?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25801568/153449842-85d07eee-f7cb-4579-a9a4-d269ba48859f.png)\r\n\r\nWIP branch: https://github.com/dkurt/DeepLabCut/tree/openvino","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
