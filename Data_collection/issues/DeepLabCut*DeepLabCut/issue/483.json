Is this silently failing? Both paths are correct, trained for 1200 iterations.\r\n\r\n- I think the instruction `Navigate to the folder corresponding to the video 'MovieS2_Perturbation_noLaser_compressed` is wrong. Should navigate to the folder `Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/labeled-data/reachingvideo1`.\r\n\r\n- The cell with `%gui wx` pops up the GUI as expected, but it is blank. This happens if I'm in a random directory, and if I first `cd ~/lib/DeepLabCut/examples/Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/videos/` in a cell above (is this what is meant by `?)\r\n\r\n![blank_gui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863327/68506092-a728d680-021d-11ea-8163-362feda1e45d.png)\r\n\r\n- If I click `load` I see `looking for a folder to start refining` and then the kernel crashes. Clicking  `quit` also  crashes the kernel. The `help` button works however.\r\n\r\nAny tips to troubleshoot? thanks so much!\r\n\r\nEdit: the latter gui problem is specific to my setup--I had to set `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the right path. Let me know if extract_outlier_frames should have an output?\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I can get extract_frames to work by doing `python -c \"import deeplabcut; path_config='/home/tyler/lib/DeepLabCut/examples/Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/config.yaml'; deeplabcut.extract_frames(path_config, 'automatic')\"`. This appears to add files to `/home/tyler/lib/DeepLabCut/examples/Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/labeled-data/reachingvideo1/`. The directory contains the files `CollectedData_Mackenzie.csv`, `CollectedData_Mackenzie.h5`, and `imgXXX.png`. \r\n\r\nWhen I then try `python -c \"import deeplabcut; path_config='/home/tyler/lib/DeepLabCut/examples/Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/config.yaml'; deeplabcut.label_frames(path_config, 'manual')\"`, I select `labeled-data/reachingvideo1`, and immediately see this error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/tyler/.conda/envs/dlc-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/multiple_individual_labeling_toolbox.py\", line 460, in browseDir\r\n    self.multibodyparts = self.cfg['multianimalbodyparts']\r\n  File \"/home/tyler/.conda/envs/dlc-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ruamel/yaml/comments.py\", line 753, in __getitem__\r\n    return ordereddict.__getitem__(self, key)\r\nKeyError: 'multianimalbodyparts'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubsequently, if I hit `next`, I see this error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/tyler/.conda/envs/dlc-gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/multiple_individual_labeling_toolbox.py\", line 678, in nextImage\r\n    self.individualrdb.SetSelection(0)\r\nAttributeError: 'MainFrame' object has no attribute 'individualrdb'\r\n\r\nEdit 3: Happy to say that labeling frames works when I launch with `python -c \"import deeplabcut; deeplabcut.launch_dlc()\". However, it fails when launched via the Demo notebook or `deeplabcut.label_frames`","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
