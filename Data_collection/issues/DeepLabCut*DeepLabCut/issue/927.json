As soon as I create a new project, when I label frames, this error message appears, without any other error messages before. Strangely, when I change the config.yaml for an old project and I want to label older frames, it works. It's really for a new project, to label the first videos. \r\nI tried to update everything, remove and reinstall the environment, install again DeepLabCut completely, nothing helps ...\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![Screen Trouble](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53442625/94310162-2fec5600-ff47-11ea-9886-8ed0ca02bced.PNG)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
