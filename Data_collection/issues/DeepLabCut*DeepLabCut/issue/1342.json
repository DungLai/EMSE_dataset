I’ve manually extracted some frames for one of my videos. One of the files was truncated, so I deleted it. When trying to label the new frames I noticed that all my points were shifted, so I used the function “dropannotationfileentriesduetodeletedimages”, but the points are still wrong. When I dragged them into the correct position for a few frames, clicked save, quit, and then re-opened the labelling GUI, none of my changes were saved. I have no idea why this could be? :frowning:\r\n\r\nStrangely I’ve found no post discussing a similar issue, I’ve searched for hours but nothing comes up…\r\n\r\nI'm using Deeplabcut 2.0 on Windows 10 in an Anaconda environment. :)","closed_by":{"login":"aridorschel","id":77439950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDM5OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77439950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel","html_url":"https://github.com/aridorschel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aridorschel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
