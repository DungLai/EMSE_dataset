In the config file, the 2 indistinguishable animals are are labeled with \"multianimalbodyparts\" and the single animal is labeled with \"uniquebodyparts\". Everything is working well though the \"Analyze videos\" tab. When I click the radio button \"create video for checking detections\" and analyze video I get the output that I am expecting. Namely, both the multi-animal points and the unique points are visible in the video.\r\n\r\nThe problem begins after I convert to tracklets and move onto the Refine tracklets tab. When launching the GUI, it only shows multianimal points and I can never again see the unique points. I've tried tinkering around with some of the options, but have become stuck. \r\n\r\nWhy are the uniquebodyparts disappearing?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"blogeman","id":62612214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjEyMjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62612214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman","html_url":"https://github.com/blogeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blogeman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
