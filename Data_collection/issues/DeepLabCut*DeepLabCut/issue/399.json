I have also tried working outside the docker container (but still in the Anaconda Env and still with DeepLabCut 2.0.8) and I got the exact same results.\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\nHello,\r\nI am trying to calibrate cameras for a 3D project. I took videos that can be viewed here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/q3mspucicm8fhfo/SideProfile2019-08-15T10_57_42.avi?dl=0) and here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/76o64f9vwznv42g/FromBelow2019-08-15T10_57_42.avi?dl=0) and then used the suggested command in Anaconda to extract the frames from each. I have looked through those extracted images and verified that the images in the calibration_images folder are correct. \r\n\r\nWhen I run the command to calibrate cameras, it doesn't find corners for any of the images. \r\nI am running the command: \r\ndeeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path_3d, cbrow = 4, cbcol = 9, calibrate=False, alpha=0.9)\r\nit outputs:\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-001.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-001.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-002.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-002.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-003.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-003.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-004.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-004.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-005.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-005.jpg\r\n...\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-483.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-484.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-484.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-485.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-485.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-486.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-486.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image FromBelow-487.jpg\r\nCorners not found for the image SideProfile-487.jpg\r\nCorners extracted! You may check for the extracted corners in the directory /home/smearlab/New Rig 3D DLC-Robin Attey-2019-08-15-3d/corners and remove the pair of images where the corners are incorrectly detected. If all the corners are detected correctly with right order, then re-run the same function and use the flag ``calibrate=True``, to calbrate the camera.\r\n\r\nThe corners folder is empty, because no corners were ever found.\r\n\r\nIs the problem with my images or with the way I am running the command? \r\n\r\nSomething to note is that the videos/images labeled \"Side Profile\" come from filming the reflection in an angled mirror. We are actually filming with one camera from below and using the mirror so we can see the side profile of the mouse as well as the underside (example here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l2345bav342t2v3/Uncropped2019-08-14T16_51_35.avi?dl=0). The videos are automatically cropped and saved separately, so I was planning to treat them as if they were coming from separate cameras for DeepLabCut purposes.\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated!
