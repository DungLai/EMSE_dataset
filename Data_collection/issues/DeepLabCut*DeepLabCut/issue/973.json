Right now I am using Spyder through the Anaconda suite to label images on my PC (Windows 10) and then train on google collab. I originally started using DLC 2.1.8 which produced really nice results\r\nHowever, when I updated to DLC 2.2b5 I have been unable to get anything similar \r\nAny idea? In more recent versions I started saving as csv though I doubt that is the issue? Otherwise I have done everything else the same as day 1. Thanks\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
