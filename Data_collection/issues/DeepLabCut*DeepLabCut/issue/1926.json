I am not sure witch directory I nedd to create and what they need to contain. \r\nfor now, this is what I made:\r\n* I have a folder named videos that contain all the videos I want to train\r\n* Config file - I am not sure if it correct\r\n\r\nI saw that I need to label the video but I dont understand in what form it should be (I need to label the frames?).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87607021/182480373-efe60257-048b-4b4a-9914-72afc8ece210.png)\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\n operating system - Google colab\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version - https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-core.git@tf2.2alpha\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
