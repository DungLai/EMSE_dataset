I use the below codes and got an error with the last `create_labeled_video_3d` function (please see the screenshot 2). I guess that the error may be caused by the result with a `triangulate` function that says \"Overall of frames=430, whereas Detected frames = 428\" (screenshot 1), but I don't know how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure that `config_path` in the sample code (`deeplabcut.create_labeled_video_3d(config_path, ['triangulated_file_folder'], start=50, end=250)`) mentions to the `config.yaml` file that was created by a `create_new_project_3d` function.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n**[Operating system and environment]**\r\n Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS, with an Anaconda Env, & DeepLabCut2.2b7.\r\n\r\n**[codes]**\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeeplabcut.create_new_project_3d('3dmodel','kato',num_cameras = 2) \r\ndeeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path3d, cbrow=8, cbcol=6, calibrate=False, alpha=0.9) \r\ndeeplabcut.calibrate_cameras(config_path3d, cbrow=8, cbcol=6, calibrate=True, alpha=0.9) \r\ndeeplabcut.check_undistortion(config_path3d, cbrow=8, cbcol=6) \r\ndeeplabcut.triangulate('/home/italab/DLC/3dmodel-kato-2020-09-25-3d/config.yaml', '/home/italab/DLC/sample', filterpredictions=True) \r\ndeeplabcut.create_labeled_video_3d('/home/italab/DLC/3dmodel-kato-2020-09-25-3d/config.yaml', ['/home/italab/DLC/sample'], start=50, end=100)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshot 1 (deeplabcut.triangulate)**\r\n\r\n![triangulate_result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72374302/95046065-4bf9af80-071e-11eb-9205-9f3b4bedf285.png)\r\n\r\n**Screenshot 2 (deeplabcut.create_labeled_video_3d)**\r\n![labeled_result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72374302/95046072-4ef4a000-071e-11eb-95f3-a2667ff005bf.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
