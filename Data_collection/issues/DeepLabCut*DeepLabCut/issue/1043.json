Is it possible to create a 3d project by using just **one camera recording different perspectives** at the same time (see video below)? I have a mouse walking from one end of a plexiglas container to the other (we are using a _Motorater_), thereby being recorded from below. Since the Motorater is equipped with mirrors, the camera catches three perspectives at one time. Now, before I start figuring out how to address this issue, I would like to know if you could tell me if it is even possible at all to use just one camera to create a 3d project?\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67375306/102892271-ea64f980-445f-11eb-8568-bfdcea6828f0.mp4\r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1043/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
