While evaluating the dataset I have specified:\r\ndisplayiters=1000,saveiters=1000,maxiters=200000\r\nThe network runs upto 100,000 without any issue but after that stops without any error at random iterations like 125000 or 175000 or 150000. Initially thought this might be due to the space on the RAM/disk. So I bought additonal space on my google drive. That didn't fix the issue. I also monitored the iterations to see if the GPU was timing out but found no error. Today when I ran the network and monitored it, it ran till about 8.50 pm without any issue then saw a message saying Completed at 7.45 pm at the bottom of the page. At this point, it was on 122000 iteration and loss was 0.0005\r\nWent ahead and evaluated the network anyway but I am getting this error: \r\n\r\n```python\r\n/content/drive/My Drive/ComSG-Mahathy-2021-03-20/evaluation-results/  already exists!\r\n/content/drive/My Drive/ComSG-Mahathy-2021-03-20/evaluation-results/iteration-0/ComSGMar20-trainset95shuffle1  already exists!\r\nRunning  DLC_resnet_50_ComSGMar20shuffle1_139000  with # of trainingiterations: 139000\r\n/content/drive/My Drive/ComSG-Mahathy-2021-03-20/evaluation-results/iteration-0/ComSGMar20-trainset95shuffle1/LabeledImages_DLC_resnet_50_ComSGMar20shuffle1_139000_snapshot-139000  already exists!\r\nInitializing ResNet\r\nActivating extracting of PAFs\r\n0it [00:00, ?it/s]Analyzing data...\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/matplotlib/backend_bases.py in _wait_cursor_for_draw_cm(self)\r\n   2805 \r\n-> 2806         self.press(event)\r\n   2807 \r\n\r\n13 frames\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_send_event'\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_webagg_core.py in send_event(self, event_type, **kwargs)\r\n    344 \r\n    345     def send_event(self, event_type, **kwargs):\r\n--> 346         self.manager._send_event(event_type, **kwargs)\r\n    347 \r\n    348 \r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_send_event'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.
