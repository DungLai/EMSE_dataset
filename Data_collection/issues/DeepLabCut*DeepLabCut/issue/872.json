I have converted the .h5 files I get into .csv files to further analyze results with Matlab. And in my tracking I have 3 stable landmarks that are present in every frame (as uniquebodyparts in the config.yaml file) . But those columns do not have any values in my .csv file, even though I see them labeled in the video that was created in the analyze video section. Do you know how I can access them?\r\n\r\n2) The hot keys (arrows) for moving through frames in the tracklet GUI do not work for me. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIsa","closed_by":{"login":"imgross","id":36044114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ0MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36044114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross","html_url":"https://github.com/imgross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
