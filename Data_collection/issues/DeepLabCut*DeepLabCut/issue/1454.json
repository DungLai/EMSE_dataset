I've used the YAML file from the [installation](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md), which mention to [this](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/s/DEEPLABCUT.yaml) file. However, during the installation, I got an error that said that there's something wrong with YAML's parser.\r\n\r\nSo, I've tried editing the YAML myself. \r\n\r\nfrom\r\n```    \r\n  - pip:\r\n    - 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2rc3\r\n```\r\n    \r\nto\r\n```    \r\n  - pip:\r\n    - 'deeplabcut[gui]==2.2rc3'\r\n```\r\n    \r\nAnd it seems to work just fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure that it happens only in my environment, or it did happen in other ones too. So, I want to mention it, and please suggest to me if there're other solutions (i.e. My using the wrong version of Conda or something else.)\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10 with Anaconda \r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\n2.2rc3\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nsingle animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\n1x RTX 2070 Super\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate CONDA Env using the file from http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/s/DEEPLABCUT.yaml\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nYAMLException: bad indentation of a sequence entry at line 28, column 24:\r\n   - 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2rc3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
