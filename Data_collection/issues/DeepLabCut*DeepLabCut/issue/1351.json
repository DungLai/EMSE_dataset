This can be fixed by the following modification to deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/lib/crossvalutils.py :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53803897/123307019-9349f980-d554-11eb-8cd9-1f1c26f78085.png)\r\nBasically the idea is to remove edges with weight of nan from the order during sorting.\r\nHope this would be informative for those trying to familiar themselves with the code using small amount of training and testing data. Ultimately, this should not be a problem if adequate training and testing data were used.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc2\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: multi-animal tracking\r\n - GPU RTX2070","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
