I believe, but I could be wrong, that previous maDLC versions did accept a directory path, because my previous notebook triggered this error.\r\n\r\nThis may be intentional for this function, in which case the docstring should be updated.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc3\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: maDLC\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. set something like `videospath = [r\"C:\\path\\to\\project\\videos\"]`\r\n2. `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections(config, videospath)`\r\n3.
