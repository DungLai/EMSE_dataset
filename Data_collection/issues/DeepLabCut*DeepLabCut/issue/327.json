Status: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version\r\n`\r\n\r\nI think this happens because by default tensor flow try to use CUDA even if I specify that I wanted to run DeepLabCut with CPU and not GPU.\r\nTo make the training working, I had to modify line 100 of pose_estimation_tensorflow/train.py:\r\n`sess = tf.Session()`\r\n\r\nWith the following:\r\nsess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(device_count={'GPU': 0}))\r\n\r\nTo ensure that it does not try to use the GPU drivers that apparently are not usable (but I am no expert there).\r\nI was wondering whether there is something that I am missing in the configuration of the training. I thought it would have been enough to setup the environment dlc-windowsCPU for that do be dealt with.
