When I tried to extract frames, I ran into the issue described in #1809, after uninstalling scripy and scikit-learn and reinstalling with conda, which allowed the frames to be extracted but the warning \r\n\r\n> UserWarning: MiniBatchKMeans is known to have a memory leak on Windows with MKL, when there are less chunks than available threads. You can prevent it by setting batch_size >= 8192 or by setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\r\n\r\nappeared. I continued on to label the frames and got this error: \r\n\r\n> TypeError: Item at index 0 has type 'int' but a sequence of bytes or strings is expected\r\n\r\nand was unable to label any frames. Several lines of highlighted code were also output and are attached below. I see that there is another solution mentioned in #1809 and #1877 that describes specifying the number of threads, would that be useful in this circumstance? If so, what is the exact code I should input?\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nQuadro RTX 5000 \r\nGPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.
