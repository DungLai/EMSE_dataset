Then the videos to be inferred are listed under cropping with coords to be cropped as the following fashion:\r\n\r\nvideos_to_be_inferred:\r\n    /path/to/video_to_be_inferred1:\r\n    cropping: True\r\n    cropping_coords: 100,200,300,400\r\n    /path/to/video_to_be_inferred2:\r\n    cropping: False\r\n    cropping_coords: 0,400,0,500 (or None if preferred) \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\nIf `config.yaml` becomes too cluttered due to a long list of videos to be inferred, we can generate a separate yaml file like `inferring_config.yaml`  and use the same logic as above?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n\r\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/246/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
