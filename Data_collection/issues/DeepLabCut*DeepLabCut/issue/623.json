I have trained three networks, they come from same 7 videos, have different number frames and Iterations. (I list the difference in the Screenshots)\r\nbut the evaluate result(MAE) not like what I think, I have three questions: \r\n1. Isn't it true that the more iterations, the smaller the MAE(Train error)? If so, why is the Train error of network 1 less than network 3?\r\n2. Isn't it true that the larger database(frame), the smaller the MAE(Train error)? If so, why is the Train error of network 1 less than network 2?\r\n3. Besides the cross entropy loss and the MAE, is there anything else that can be used to compare and evaluate the two networks?\r\nLooking forward to your reply.
