Mostly it runs well however I saw different problems here:\r\n1) Lots of outliers in the labelled video and the extraction outlier function did not work. \r\n2) Refine label function did not work (although .h5 file in the correct path folder). \r\n3) The shadow on walls/fecal bouts are considered data points sometimes. Also its messier when you use opto patch cables. The data points keep on jumping to the patch cable.\r\n\r\nFollowing are commands I used (when I did first installation):**\r\n1. mkdir /home/cborkar/conda-envs\r\n2. cd /home/cborkar/conda-envs/\r\n3. export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/home/cborkar/conda-envs/\r\n4. module load anaconda3/2018.12\r\n5. conda create -n DLC1 python=3.7 --yes\r\n6. source activate DLC1\r\n7. conda install jupyter nb_conda tensorflow==1.13.1 wxpython ruamel.yaml dask --yes\r\n8. export PYTHONPATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\r\n9. export PYTHONUSERBASE=$CONDA_PREFIX\r\n10. pip install deeplabcut --user --use-feature=2020-resolver\r\n11.
