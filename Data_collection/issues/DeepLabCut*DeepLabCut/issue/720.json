The first one will be quite easy to answer, but i don't found the answer myself.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nWhen you refer to the numbers of frames which you use to train a network, does this number represent the total amount of frames or the frames per video that you use to train the network?\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nyou want to train a network based on three different videos and want to pick 150 frames.\r\nDoes this mean:\r\n3 x 150 frames = 450 frames\r\nor\r\n3 x 50 frames = 150 frames\r\n?\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is the format of the config file.\r\nI want to implement a skeleton into my config file but i don't know whether i did it the correct way.\r\nAdditionally, i currently using DLC 2.1.6 but i want to switch to 2.2 as soon as the beta ends. \r\nDoes this change the way to write the skeleton in the config file? E.g. because of the new skeleton builder?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease tell me when this problem has been solved somewhere else!\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2020-06-02_10-19-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66300664/83497553-ecaf3880-a4ba-11ea-9fe8-df834e3311a7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
