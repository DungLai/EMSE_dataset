She is not getting good results which we think has to do with insufficient training.\r\n\r\nAs I am starting from square one with TensorFlow and Deep LabCut, I thought to install the necessary software to a stand alone PC starting with Ubuntu and adding the additional bits following the installation documentation after which I would do some experiments with the software.\r\n\r\nI am finding the install procedures to be confusing primarily because there are so many details with side branches and links to supporting materials and what appears to be multiple ways of doing the installation. And mixing Docker in with everything else isn't helping.\r\n\r\nI would really like to have an overall description of the process the whys and whats of the procedures for the process with cleaner, separated out descriptions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to contribute to the installation documentation for Linux if I could just work through the actual process and successfully install and be able to do a first project.\r\n\r\nWhat I am going to do is to start all over again from scratch and do a fresh install of Ubuntu then go through the procedures again. Perhaps after doing this a few times I will be able to complete the installation and a first project successfully.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
