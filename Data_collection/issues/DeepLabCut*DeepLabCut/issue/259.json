The question is, what is the best way to analyse a video containing 6 (2 mice, 3 sights per mouse) fields of view and how can the data be combined afterwards? \r\nI would really appreciate it, if someone had a suggestion for me. I did a trial once with loading the whole video as input, but with cropping coordinates. The cropping worked for the labelling, but the training and analysis was done on the whole video. Would it be better to crop the video before giving it as input to Deeplabcut? \r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n<img width=\"1908\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49393203/55712379-e9233d00-59ee-11e9-9087-04f8f0452b13.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
