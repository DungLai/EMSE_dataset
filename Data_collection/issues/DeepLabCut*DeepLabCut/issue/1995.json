I can complete only to proceed all phases. However, I always face same errors. Then, please help you with my explain for errors.\r\n1.\tUndistotion Error \r\nAt first, please show these photos.\r\n\r\n・Error Undistotion Images①\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"601\" alt=\"2022-09-27\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192446735-5a3bb2ac-e071-4d40-8595-fee71c2631fa.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nError Undistotion Images②\r\n\r\n<img width=\"597\" alt=\"2022-09-27 (1)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192446789-e04d7538-7cfe-48a5-826f-313dbf7029b1.png\">\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThese photos show the error of calibrating camera and making odd 3d images with images which are extract corners from my all pictures.\r\nWhen I try this phase, I always use over 500 images which are included in both two cameras. Also, I cut these about 10 minutes from two movie with alarm. Then, the one-third are removed for operating calibration. \r\nI paste two pictures under for showing this situation. \r\n\r\nleft⇩　                            　　\r\n 　　 \r\n![left64_corner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192446906-7bafab52-66b2-40aa-8cb5-63f09196c2bd.jpg)\r\n\r\nright⇩\r\n\r\n![right64_corner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192446991-6b23b588-9b77-407e-b2d0-1a71c5dbb9f7.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think I can do what I have to do for proceeding next triangulating phase. However, I always face this error. Why is this error happened?\r\n⇩ Under picture is config file to change \r\n \r\n<img width=\"583\" alt=\"2022-09-27 (2)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192447036-2c6d34c7-08e1-4d94-90c1-d69710ffe919.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tTriangulate Error(CSV Error)\r\nI think this error which is based on first error because 3d image is odd. \r\nThe reason why I think is came from under picture.\r\n \r\n<img width=\"568\" alt=\"2022-09-27 (3)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192452583-1da8cc7c-06d5-4f18-bd9d-dbd08c3d93e4.png\">\r\n\r\nThis picture shows there are nothing in both of 3d images. Therefore, I think first second error is made for first error. In fact, I have another confusing point. This is what CSV file isn’t written all. \r\nplease refer under picture. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"2022-09-20 (20)\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114043422/192447170-7c06e109-c58f-4f1e-b0f7-8d72ee186aa1.png\">\r\n\r\nThis picture’s “bodyparts” means “1-1(1月1日)”、“1-2(1月2日)” and “1-3（1月3日）.\r\nThis csv file is made when I operate the triangulating phase and based on the h5.file. \r\nI always make this csv when I triangulate label movie. Please tell me why this situation is occurred and help me to make 3d labeling movie\r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nwindows 11 \n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndlc version is 2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\n3d\n\n### Device type\n\nGpu is Nothing.(The reason why I try to make 3d demo camera)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI think all steps from making folder to creating 3d label movie.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nI think nothing.\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n・When I use iPhone se2 as two cameras. Therefore, I can’t use stereo camera. \r\n・Also, when I finish to take movies, I always convert picture type from png to jpg.\r\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1995/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
