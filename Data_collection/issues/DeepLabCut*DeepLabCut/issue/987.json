Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the only option to rotate (I guess 90Â°) in the analyze videos. Since the info is passed to ffmpeg, it would be nice to be able to rotate videos by an arbitrary angle. This is important in combination with the cropping GUI.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen clicking on CROP in the GUI, give the option to rotate by X degrees. Since it is a still image it should be possible.\r\n\r\nffmpeg can handle arbitrary angles with the following option: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#rotate\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe current alternative is to rotate and crop the videos one by one, but it is nicer in the GUI. Another option (overkill) is to use some contour recognition openCV magic to automatically detect the rectangle to crop, even if it needs rotation.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMaybe not an extreme example. But rotating the video here would allow a clean bounding box.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-11-07 at 10 01 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4943380/98437159-64276a80-20e0-11eb-8a48-c0333c8ba8c0.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2020-11-07 at 10 02 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4943380/98437163-6689c480-20e0-11eb-9e0b-54cf94f66856.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/987/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
