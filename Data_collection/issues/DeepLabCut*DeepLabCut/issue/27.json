Run \"Step3_CheckLabels.py\"\r\n4. Error is produced\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\nWe have been skipping step 1 and labelling the images ourselves using FIJI. In our CSV file, the slices do not correspond to the image orders since some images were skipped and deleted. (For example, the slices may be 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, etc... and the images associated with slices 4 and 5 have been deleted from the folder.) \r\nIn addition, we were able to train the CNN last week by labelling the images ourselves, so we are not sure why we are suddenly getting this error and smaller .h5 files produced in step 2. (The .h5 file produced in Step2 from the first time we ran it when it worked was 83K)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
