I end up having to type Ctrl C to get out of it in terminal.  In my config.yaml file, I have:\r\n```\r\n# Cropping Parameters (for analysis and outlier frame detection)\r\ncropping: true\r\n#if cropping is true for analysis, then set the values here:\r\nx1: 471\r\nx2: 288\r\ny1: 958\r\ny2: 0\r\n```\r\nThese are the values I use when cropping in ffmpeg, but I didn't think the values specified here matter at all since it should pull the values selected from the GUI and use those.  I should note that, anytime I run a step that requires the GUI, like the label frames step, it returns an error saying\" ImportError: Cannot load backend 'TkAgg' which requires the 'tk' interactive framework, as 'wx' is currently running.\" \r\n\r\nTo proceed, I type import matplotlib then matplotlib.use('Agg')  and then re-run the deeplabcut step. After doing this, the GUI will appear, but deeplabcut terminal always gets stuck when the gui closes.  Any suggestions? I am using python in conda on Windows 10 computer.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
