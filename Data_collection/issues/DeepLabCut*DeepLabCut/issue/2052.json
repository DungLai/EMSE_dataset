There when using defaults and clicking on the ```Analyze Videos``` button the error ```AttributeError: 'AnalyzeVideos' object has no attribute 'create_detections_video_checkbox'``` comes up. From looking at the code, it looks like the widget [```create_detections_video_checkbox```](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/f7170311e68b4ad9ae15bc10894226f927573b45/deeplabcut/gui/tabs/analyze_videos.py#L171) is created in the call to [```_generate_layout_multianimal```](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/f7170311e68b4ad9ae15bc10894226f927573b45/deeplabcut/gui/tabs/analyze_videos.py#L133) which obviously only happens for multi-animal experiments. I'm not familiar enough with DLC to know whether that option should also be available for single animal experiments and therefore the widget be created somewhere else, or if that call should only happen for multi-animal experiments.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMac M1\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.3rc2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nMac M1 GPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSimply install the latest version on main and run a default analysis with the example mouse data.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
