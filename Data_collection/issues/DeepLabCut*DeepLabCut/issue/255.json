I found the command that would convert the csv files to hdf.       [deeplabcut.convertcsv2h5(config_path)] \r\n\r\nWhen I run the code a prompt asks me if I want to convert the file and I enter yes. However, I get an error that says \"ValueError: numpy.ufunc size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 216 from C header, got 192 from PyObject\" \r\n\r\nWhen I googled the error, a few suggestions came up to update Numpy. I used the anaconda navigator to update and Numpy is currently 1.16.0 while Numpy-base is 1.16.2. I still get the error and am unsure what to do. \r\n\r\n\r\nError is on line 59 of OF_LgTraining.py Script (attached) \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49172549/55365362-83d8c480-54a1-11e9-9d8c-0065065121fc.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOF_LgTraining.py script \r\n[OF_LgTraining.txt](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/files/3031688/OF_LgTraining.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
