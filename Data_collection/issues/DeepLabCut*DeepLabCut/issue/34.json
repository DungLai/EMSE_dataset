However, it does not appear that the software can classify behaviors based on the pose-data. My lab would like to use your software to detect and classify certain behaviors so that we can run more targeted experiments on our mice. The idea is that based on the pose-data, the software can classify the behavior it's tracking. For example, if I were to pick out a random frame from the analyzed video, it would tell me that at this frame the mouse was rearing, grooming, etc. The closest program that I found with this capability is this: \r\n\r\nprint: http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ncomms1064.pdf\r\ncode: http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/mouse/\r\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I am not sure how difficult this will be to implement into your code but I think it would be a rather useful addition. \r\n\r\nMore than happy to chat more about this if you'd like a more detailed description of the feature request!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDavidSBU","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
