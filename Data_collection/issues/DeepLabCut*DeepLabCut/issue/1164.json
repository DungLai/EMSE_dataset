In this case, should I remove the label or just keep it there?\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce the problem**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Enter DLC env: activate DLC (I named the env \"DLC\", but it uses tensorflow-gpu)\r\n2. Open DLC GUI: python -m deeplabcut\r\n3. Import config file.\r\n5. Extract frames from raw mp4 file (after analyzing a video)\r\n6. Refine Labels (Launch).\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your detailed help so far!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSimon","closed_by":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
