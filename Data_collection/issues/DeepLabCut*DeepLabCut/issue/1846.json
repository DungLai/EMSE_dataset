Please describe.**\r\nIn some cases (see image below), the machine labels in images that were extracted as outliers overlap so well that it is hard to detect that it is overlapping. Only one of those labels is correct. This is particularly hard when the colours happen to be so close to each other. This happened a few times and probably just confuses the model when training.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-05-25 at 10 49 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4943380/170222930-ff56106a-cbb6-4110-9035-8dcb7f5116c5.png)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI am not yet sure what is the best way to deal with it or make them better visible...
