The demo gif movies are so cool, And I am excited when I saw deeplabcut is in pure python and has a wx ui interface. \r\n\r\nMay I take the liberty to invite you. I wish we can collaborate to write a deeplabcut plugins for [ImagePy](https://github.com/Image-Py/imagepy), which is a image process framework like ImageJ, but implemented in pure python, and with a wx ui. \r\n\r\nIn ImagePy we can use any method and libraries based on Numpy directly. And the interaction such as label, image io, image view, marker is ready-made. And we can show chart (loss function curve), and table(net and trainning result) easily in ImagePy. So I think there will be no trouble to integrate. I can do a start.\r\n\r\nlastly, a question, when I try \"pip install deeplabcut\", it erase so many packages to old version, I think it is not friendly for a developer, and break some environment dependence. Is this needed? could it be solved?\r\n\r\nI think both ImagePy and DeepLabCut would benefit from a plugin easy to install and friendly to use. Anyone interested in?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
