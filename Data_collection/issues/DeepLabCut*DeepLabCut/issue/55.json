Data and code are mixed freely in the directory structure, and there are some hacky bits, like in `Generating_a_Training_Set`, to import `myconfig`, there is `sys.path.append(os.getcwd().split('Generating_a_Training_Set')[0])`, which is very nonstandard.\r\n\r\nTo improve on this, I would suggest making DeepLabCut into a Python package installable using `setuptools`. Advantages include:\r\n- A clear code x data split\r\n- better `git ignore`ability\r\n- ability to use relative imports, without modifying `sys.path`. In `Step2`, we could just `import .myconfig`\r\n- being pythonic/idiomatic, more understandable by developers unfamiliar with the project\r\n- the package could be made installable through `pip` which would simplify installation\r\n- could be run as a module from anywhere using something like `python -m deeplabcut.train`\r\n\r\nThis would involve\r\n- moving all source code into `deeplabcut/`, structuring it into directories\r\n- making a `setup.py`\r\n- fixing hardcoded paths currently in the project\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I would be willing to do this myself, however I would like to know whether the original devs would be interested, because I know this is not a trivial change.","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/55/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
