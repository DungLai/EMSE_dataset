Please describe.**\r\nMy setup involves recording behaviour via a camera that captures and saves each frame as  a numpy array.  The process of converting the numpy arrays into images and then into videos is quite confusing, as it's tough to decide which video format to save in.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI was wondering if DLC could allow for setting the path to an image folder instead, and then use the raw uncompressed images (e.g. tiff) or even the numpy arrays to run the pose estimation on.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs of now I'm using cv2.VideoWriter in python to write the .tiff images into .avi using 'MPEG' as the fourcc.  These are the videos I'm using to do pose estimation in DLC.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
