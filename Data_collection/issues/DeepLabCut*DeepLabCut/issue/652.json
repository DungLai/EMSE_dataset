Create a project with a large number of labeled training images\r\n2. run deeplabcut.check_labels(config)\r\n3. Watch resource use (activity monitor on Mac). On my laptop, python hit 6 GB usage before the computer crashed. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter each video folder, or each plotted image is saved, the memory should be cleared. \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n - OS: macOS 10.15.4\r\n - DeepLabCut Version 2.1.6.4 (python 3.7.6)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI tried editing MakeLabeledPlots() by adding:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport gc\r\n...\r\nplt.cla()\r\nplt.clf()\r\nplt.close(\"all\")\r\ngc.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich did not fix the issue.","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
