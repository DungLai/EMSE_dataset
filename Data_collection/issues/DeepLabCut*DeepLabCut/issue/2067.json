Please describe.**\r\nWhen using `deeplabcut.create_labeled_video` for a video that was analyzed with cropping, the bodyparts are marked correctly when `displaycropped=True` is used (the created video is cropped and bodyparts are correctly plotted). However, if I want to create a video in its original, full-frame view (non-cropped) plus the extracted bodyparts coordinates (`displaycropped=False`), the bodyparts are plotted in the wrong coordinates because they do not take into account the cropping.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen running `deeplabcut.create_labeled_video` with `displaycropped=False` for a video that was analyzed with cropping, bodyparts coordinates should take into account the cropping. This probably means adding the video crop x1 and y1 values to the bodyparts coordinate before plotting them on the frames.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
