with matplotlib or wx.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/__init__.py#L26\r\n\r\nFor those that are willing to use deeplabcut as a tools, setting global backends in the main init file is quite invasive.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if you would reconsider these choices.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to create the pull requests that would move the backend changes to the gui functionality and avoid setting the backends in the init file.\r\n\r\nLet me know.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\n2.2.0.1\r\n\r\n### Code of
