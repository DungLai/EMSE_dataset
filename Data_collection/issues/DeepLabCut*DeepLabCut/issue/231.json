For the analyzed videos with a single animal is working quite nicely.\r\n\r\nAfter re-reading the paper to be sure, I tried to analyze videos with two animals, expecting to get the selected points on both animals by the transferred learning. However, what I get is the single 2 points that split between the animals, so for example, in some frames the nose is in animal A, in the next ones it jumps to animal B and so on. \r\n\r\nMy question/problem is that I don't really know if I need to modify something in the .yaml files in order to generalize to multiple animals (I thought I might needed to duplicate the bodyparts in the config yaml depending on the number of animals or something else). Or it just might be that the model needs more training. \r\n\r\nSo another question popping up is if it is better to try training a single animal model, for later analyzing videos with multiple animals, or in the other hand, it is better to train the model with videos containing multiple animals and the label all the desired points (animal1_nose, animal2_nose, animal1_tailbase, animal2_tailbase...).\r\n\r\nAny feedback wil be much appreaciated,\r\n\r\nBR\r\n\r\n \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JoanEA08","id":48244528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjQ0NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48244528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08","html_url":"https://github.com/JoanEA08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanEA08/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
