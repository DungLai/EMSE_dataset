OS: Windows10, jupyter\r\n - DeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc1\r\n - DeepLabCut mode: maDLC\r\n - chrome\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. extract outliers on videos not already in maDLC model that was based on cropped images\r\n2. merge\r\n3. run: \r\n        ```\r\n        dlc.cropimagesandlabels(config,\r\n                       numcrops=10,\r\n                       size=(256,256),\r\n                       userfeedback=False,\r\n                       cropdata=True,\r\n                       excludealreadycropped=True,\r\n                       updatevideoentries=True,\r\n                       )\r\n         ```\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE that this only occurs when `excludealreadycropped=True`. When `False`, all videos are recropped, and `video_sets_original` is as it should be.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNewly refined videos should be cropped and appended to `video_sets_original` rather than replacing all entries in `video_sets_original`. This would allow for re-cropping to different sizes, or other manipulations to all existing videos.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
