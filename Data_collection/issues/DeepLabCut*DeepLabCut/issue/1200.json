It is a great tool. So far we have been using it with Google Colab but I would like to make the training in a Nvidia Quadro RTX 4000 with 8GB of RAM. \r\n\r\nI installed the last version from the .yaml files, which it says it is the Deeplabcut 2.0\r\n\r\nTo install the Nvidia Driver + CUDA I tried this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0/wiki/Installation-of-NVIDIA-driver-and-CUDA-10\r\n\r\nand also this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ykogr/misc/blob/master/210116_Installation_of_Deeplabcut_to_Ubuntu.md\r\n\r\nI tried to install it from both my working Ubuntu partition, uninstalling nvidia and cuda and reinstalling them again following the instructions but also from a freshly Ubuntu installation. The result is always the same. I always get the convolution problem when I try to train a neural network. \r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nBelow I attach what my system responds to the typical commands to retrieve Nvidia and CUDA information.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n```\r\n**gcc --version**\r\ngcc (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0\r\nCopyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
