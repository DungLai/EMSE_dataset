Please describe.**\r\nIssue99(https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/99)\r\nProblem happened when 3.create_new_project with copy_videos=True.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHere is an email I sent to Mackenzie Mathis yesterday(But I haven't get no reply.. maybe she is busy?). \r\n\r\nHello,I wrote a issue(https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/99) 3 days ago and now I find that below fixing can solve the problem 3.create_new_project with copy_videos=True.\r\n\r\nI realized that it is the problem specified to windows. For windows users, we should add this code to new.py(Anaconda3\\envs\\(your env name)\\Lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\create_project\\new.py)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBefore explanation,\r\n\r\nI want to make sure that I have run the code with two slashes(not one slash). It's not the problem caused by the fact that I didn't follow your instruction.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nvideo=['C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\Video_files_Deeplabcut\\\\LinearChamber\\\\20180906\\\\Trial1.mpg'] # Enter the paths of your videos you want to grab frames from.\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.create_new_project(task,experimenter,video, working_directory='C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop', copy_videos=False) #change the working directory to where you want the folders created.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut somehow, the path strings were changed to strings which have only one slashes even if some codes need the path with two slashes (I don't know why).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1) I made a simple func that change existing string(\\) to new string which have double slashes(\\\\)\r\n\r\ndef double_slash(str):\r\n\r\n    temp_list=str.split('\\\\')\r\n\r\n    result_str='\\\\\\\\'.join(temp_list)\r\n\r\n    print(result_str)\r\n\r\n    return result_str;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) I changed (maybe line 103~?)\r\n\r\n    if copy_videos==True:\r\n\r\n        print(\"Copying the videos\")\r\n\r\n        for src, dst in zip(videos, destinations):\r\n\r\n            src=double_slash(str(src))\r\n\r\n            dst=double_slash(str(dst))\r\n\r\n            shutil.copy(src,dst)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3)Also, I changed (maybe line 125~?)\r\n\r\n    # adds the video list to the config.yaml file\r\n\r\n    video_sets = {}\r\n\r\n    for video in videos:\r\n\r\n        print(video)\r\n\r\n        video=double_slash(str(video))\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen it works. Could you please check this on windows 10 with conda environment?\r\n\r\nAlso, may I recieve a invitation message for deeplabcut slack group?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
