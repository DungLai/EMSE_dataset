The mismatch appears to worsen if the networks are trained on more iterations. I am using the default settings from the GUI, and resnet_50. I have been working with Gonçalo to try to solve this.\r\n\r\nImages:\r\n[bonsai_mismatch.pdf](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/5978230/bonsai_mismatch.pdf)\r\n\r\nOthers have reported [similar issues](https://groups.google.com/g/bonsai-users/c/wXJpUjZayWM/m/FRTA7YaEBwAJ)\r\n\r\nPer @MMathisLab suggestion to Gonçalo, I tried changing the global_scale in pose_cfg.yaml (in both train/test folder) parameter. No luck--the mismatch occurs whether global_scale=0.5,0.8,1.0\r\n\r\nGonçalo was able to reproduce the mismatch on his machine using my dataset (but not others).\r\n\r\nMy system: Windows10, DeepLabCut 2.2b, single animal tracking\r\n\r\nGonçalo seems to think that the problem lies in the fact that the DLC GUI performs some additional steps during video annotation, as opposed to Bonsai-DLC which outputs the raw result from the tensorflow inference. We were wondering then what these additional steps were, if any? Gonçalo also wonders if [this was one such step](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/d04c5da1b76033cf1b43d323eec45f74e36bf6ab/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/nnet/predict.py#L74)\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
