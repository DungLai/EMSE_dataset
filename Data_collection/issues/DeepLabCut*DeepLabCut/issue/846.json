The Videos are cropped by GUI, labelled in a reproducible manner with 5-12 labels. The network has been trained in numerous approaches with 50-250 frames from different individuals, cameras, backgrounds, lighting conditions, selected either manually or automatically, with different augmentations (Default, imgaug, tensorpack), iterations (50k to 1 Million) and up to 7 refinement steps. Care was taken as to include Frames with obscured bodyparts which are not labeled. Known videos are predicted robustly with around 2-6 Pixel Errors. The function \"check labels\" after labelling frames has never worked on our system, but labelled frames were visually checked in their respective Folders.\r\nI would be very thankful for some more input on troubleshooting, as I am slowly running out of ideas.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMax","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
