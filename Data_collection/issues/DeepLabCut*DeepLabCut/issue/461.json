But then I decided to train the network on 20 more videos. For that i created a new project with those 40 videos but labelled only new 20 videos and copy-pasted already labelled 20 videos (containing frames, .h5 & .csv files) from the previous project and then put the system on training. Upon evaluation it seems it was trained only on those new 20 videos. Now i have two projects trained separately on 20 videos each. Is there anyway that i can merge training dataset from those projects. Or what can i do to make a single project with already existing projects? \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
