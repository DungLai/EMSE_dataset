Instead of leaving the ruler in the videos and having DLC label them, I want to take one image with the ruler in both FOVs and then manually select 2 points that have known distances (because they are on the ruler).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to take those 2 points, each in it’s own camera view, and then use the camera calibration files to triangulate them? If so, how would I do that?
