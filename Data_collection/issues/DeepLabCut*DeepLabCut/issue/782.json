I cannot seem to run this part correctly. I attached a file to show my error.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** After attempting more times, I found another error after setting my paths for 'refine_tracklets.' This is a OSerror: HD5 error back trace. The other concern I had was on setting the correct path for 'pickle_or_h5_file', as I have three different pickle files that were in my videos folder (full, meta, and bx). \r\n\r\nThank you so much for the time and help! \r\n\r\n![header error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64938386/86507658-98d88d80-bd9f-11ea-9519-dca2ee1971df.PNG)\r\n![new error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64938386/86517750-fb0dae80-bdf0-11ea-95ac-d789653f3c5e.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
