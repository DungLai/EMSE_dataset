the recommended line worked and this time it did not for some reason and it reappeared while updating. Any help would be much appreciated! I also might be misreading the releases and noting that the new release might be needing to be installed differently.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
