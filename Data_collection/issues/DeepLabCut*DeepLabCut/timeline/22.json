Earlier this morning I had a terminal open that I had done the training on, but I assumed it wasn't doing anything because I had stopped it with ctrl-c. I closed it sometime this morning and must have made the wrong association with what was resolving the issue. \r\n\r\nI just tested the original AnalyzeVideo.py code and it works fine. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help, this thread can probably be closed now!
