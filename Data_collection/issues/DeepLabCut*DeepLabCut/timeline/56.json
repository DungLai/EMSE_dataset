As reported in the paper inference is quite fast (~30 FPS for 600 x 400 pixels, and up to 90 FPS for ~200 x 200 pixels). However we will also share faster versions in the future. Here, we are not going to integrate them with webcams though. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexander","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/418408833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1825595205,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgyNTU5NTIwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1825595205","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T15:21:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1129434140","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/56#issuecomment-1129434140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/56","id":1129434140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5DUcwc","user":{"login":"KennyTC","id":16069257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY5MjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16069257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC","html_url":"https://github.com/KennyTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KennyTC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-18T00:08:01Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T00:08:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, \r\nI would like to continue this thread. \r\nCurrently, does DLC support inference from Webcam?
