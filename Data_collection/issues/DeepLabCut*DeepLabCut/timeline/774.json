It's the same error message which appears if you try to annotate the same point twice. Same error, two different (at least from the GUI level) scenarios.  \r\n\r\nI understand where you're coming from in terms of \"intended use\". If a marker is removed why would it be added back? I have no clue; perhaps I deleted the wrong one, perhaps I decide upon deletion that the marker actually can be placed, etc. It's just weird behaviour as far as the interface is concerned. The error message is also unhelpful, if I've removed an annotation why does the error message tell me that the point is already annotated?\r\n\r\nIt's made worse by the fact that removing points is possible, you just have to navigate back one frame then forward and try again; or, if you saved you can reload from there and try again. It's just an interface problem, the functionality is already there. Why not just allow the user to do it without the workarounds?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/651723306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"refmitchell","id":10943932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQzOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10943932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell","html_url":"https://github.com/refmitchell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refmitchell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/651834292","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/774#issuecomment-651834292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/774","id":651834292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTgzNDI5Mg==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T14:35:48Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T14:38:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I understand your point, but the backend first is not straightforward and since this is an odd behavior for a user, it will have to be low priority to change this. Of course, we welcome contributions so if you want to edit the GUI /pandas interface for being sure it’s actually deleted, then please go ahead (that was the issue as it’s hard to remove what temp written, I e place holder now that you activated the point. We can delete the data which then drops the line once saved, but that required you to engage next/previous.)\r\n\r\nI would also update to 2.1.8.2 as there was changes to the GUI (although I didn’t test this specific behavior). But once can now hit delete. \r\n\r\nAgain, I wouldn’t recommend using the GUI this way in general, hence why me make it slow for you to delete (two clicks!).\r\n\r\nSo, in short, happy for a pull request!
