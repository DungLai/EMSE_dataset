for pointing me to that @jeylau. I first tried a minor edit just converting the existing check_labels to the named-object based plotting, and that did not help.

I'm happy to submit a PR if you want, unless the new release is coming soon enough.\r\n\r\nThere was a third, more literally copied, version I tried, when I tried loading the images into an image collection. That failed with a \"read of closed file exception\", which I replicated outside of deeplabcut, and with multiple image paths (with and without spaces, etc).
