REPRODUCE:\r\n1) I used the GUI to do all steps leading up to the check_labels.\r\n *note: if it matters, for ```extract frames``` I need to select ```want to use OpenCV?``` to ```no``` because it fails if I do ```yes``` (I suppose I probably don't have OpenCV installed but have not got around to that yet since the ```no``` option worked -- ie. let me proceed).\r\n\r\n2) ```Label Frames``` followed by Save/Quit after doing the labeling.\r\n3) ```Check Labels``` (and ```check individual labels``` resulted in same misbehavior)\r\n4) Look at the resulting images generated: The labels were very far off from what I had done.\r\nIn all cases I have seen so far, the incorrect images are incorrect in the following way: the skeletons were the correct shape/connection, they were just not located in the correct part of the image. Almost as if the labels were being associated with the wrong images. (*note: I did see a couple that ended up correctly labelled, but the majority were incorrect*)\r\n5) However, unlike @DavidAIWolf, when I return to the ```Label Frames``` function in the GUI the labels on these images are still in the location that I had put them before checking the labels\r\n\r\nI also have:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4777333/85280470-31911400-b456-11ea-82e4-b2efbef3d158.png)\r\n*note: ```import wxPython``` was not recognized, only ```import wx```*\r\n\r\nHere is the config file as .txt confirming uniquebody parts are not connected to multianimal (I don't have any unique)(I just set extract frame number variable to '3' to start debugging this):\r\n[config.txt](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/4812828/config.txt)\r\n\r\n**Labeling:**\r\n(followed by SAVE/QUIT after labeling)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4777333/85282239-66eb3100-b459-11ea-91cd-d130f03ce4c5.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4777333/85282367-9d28b080-b459-11ea-8b3a-458d73bb28c0.png)\r\n\r\n**Result of ```Check Labels``` (run from GUI):**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4777333/85282637-145e4480-b45a-11ea-8e87-5d7c002dd92e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4777333/85282676-2344f700-b45a-11ea-9c86-43bfb0a0475b.png)\r\n\r\n**Return to GUI and go back to ```Label Frames```:**\r\nThe labels actually still are in the correct location according to the label frames part of the GUI.
