a systems administrator, getting people set up with a headless/non-GUI version of DeepLabCut on our [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) batch cluster has been a bit of a pain point, in large part due to errors like this (OpenCV also has similar issues; see [here](https://confluence.columbia.edu/confluence/display/zmbbi/DeepLabCut)).\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, I'd like to see these errors eliminated by decoupling the GUI from the core functionality completely.  This sort of bottom-up approach (which is associated with the Unix philosophy; see [here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/12/14/biculturalism/)) would have one package, `deeplabcut`, which would essentially be the light mode that currently is toggled on using an environment variable.  Another package, `deeplabcut-gui`, would contain wx and any other graphical components particular to DLC.  `deeplabcut-gui` would have `deeplabcut` as a dependency, and `deeplabcut` would be able to be installed independently without `deeplabcut-gui`.\r\n\r\nThe bottom-up approach stands in contrast to top-down GUI-centric development (more in line with the Microsoft/Windows way of doing things), which seems to be the current operating philosophy that is being used in this project.  Such a GUI-centric approach has its merits, but also has some severe limitations.  In addition to making batch processing hard, a GUI-centric approach to software development also means that it's harder to transition from one interface to another.  \r\n\r\nAs an example, in a past life I did tech support for a package called [C-PAC](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC) that had a `wx` GUI tightly-coupled with its core functionality.  Such tight coupling gave the benefit of making a friendly user interface a first-class component, but also prevented us from switching to a web-based interface and locked us down into the `wx` ecosystem.  Having `wx` live alongside the core functionality also meant that it was harder to enforce a separation of concerns, as bugs with core functionality and bugs with the GUI started to blur together.  Eventually, it seems as though the `wx` dependency was painstakingly excised from C-PAC some time after I left, but not after a significant time investment.\r\n\r\nOne last point about modularization- having the GUI live in its own package opens the door for new interfaces to DeepLabCut across a variety of platforms (some of which you may not even need to support!).  I personally would be interested in seeing a version of the DeepLabCut GUI that exists as a Jupyter notebook / JupyterLab module.\r\n\r\n_edit:_ More concisely, my point is that I think that it would be worthwhile to have the DeepLabCut GUI be its own independent project separate from the core DLC functionality (i.e., the light mode),  living in its own separate Github repository.  I think that there can be design decisions made here beyond how packaging is done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/611044059/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jpellman","id":5000591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5000591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman","html_url":"https://github.com/jpellman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpellman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/611052796","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/597#issuecomment-611052796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/597","id":611052796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTA1Mjc5Ng==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T16:17:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T16:17:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dear @jpellman absolutely agree.
