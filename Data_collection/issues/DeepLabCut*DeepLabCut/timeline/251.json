You can check in your config file, the variable video_sets should have the full path of symlink rather than the real path.  \r\nWhen you try to open the video it opens the real path and not the symlink. When cropping, the toolbox tries to access the croping parameters of the video from the config.yaml file and  because the config file has symlink, it could not find the parameters and throws error. \r\n**FIX:** \r\nEither you can copy the video while creating the project.\r\nor\r\nChange the line 133 in new.py under create_project which is \r\n`rel_video_path = os.path.realpath(video)` \r\nto\r\n `rel_video_path=str(Path.resolve(Path(video)))`\r\nand reinstall DeepLabCut from your local repository.\r\nWe will release this fix soon.\r\nAlso, you do not need to specify `crop=True` for manual extraction, as the GUI will anyway ask the user if you need to crop. The argument `crop=True` is mainly for automatic extraction.\r\n \r\nHope it helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/478236799/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"meet10may","id":5408796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDg3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5408796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may","html_url":"https://github.com/meet10may","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2241646960,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNDE2NDY5NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2241646960","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3b10ea5bbb4cdba6ee6c0cc2481f4058f71fe5da","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/commits/3b10ea5bbb4cdba6ee6c0cc2481f4058f71fe5da","created_at":"2019-03-31T16:51:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/478358368","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/251#issuecomment-478358368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/251","id":478358368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODM1ODM2OA==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-31T16:52:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-31T16:52:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Put it in repo.
