@jonahpc I am not sure / hard for me to test as I don't have this set up, sorry! `'\\\\\\\\?\\\\E:/` But I think this is the issue; maybe check your config.yaml to be sure the video path link does not start with `?`

\r\njust experienced the same issue working from an external HDD, not NAS, with Windows, DeepLabCut `2.2.0.2` and python `3.8.12`. \r\nI noticed that my config.yaml containes a few `?` for specific videos (actually those in h.265 but not those in h.264) and that the `project_path:` is formated in slashes, while the `video_sets:` are in backslashes. \r\n\r\nWhat solved the error above for me was not changing the paths in the config.yaml file (these get overwritten) but changing the `config_path` in `deeplabcut.evaluate_network(config_path)` to backslashes. \r\n\r\nThis seems to have changed during the last updates (python 3.8?), since getting the `config_path` from tk with `filedialog.askopenfilenames()` worked fine before...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/975473236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","id":66069491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66069491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","html_url":"https://github.com/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/975630251","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1563#issuecomment-975630251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1563","id":975630251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c46Ju-r","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T15:15:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T15:15:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"oh
