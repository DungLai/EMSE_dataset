We have been discussing this in several issues #488  #528, Twitter, in our docs: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/UseOverviewGuide.md\r\n\r\n> Coming soon: as of 2.2 we support multi-animal projects. The workflow is highly similar, but with some key steps that differ. Please carefully review the functions below for more details. You can search/look for maDeepLabCut for specific steps that are changed. But until the package (2.2) is released, these steps are not functional.\r\n\r\nAnd have a sneak peak here on youtube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qbEqNKApsI). We will be releasing a major update soon that allows for multi-animal pose estimation ... please stay tuned! Rest assured we are working hard to bring the latest/greatest updates for multi-animal pose estimation to our users
