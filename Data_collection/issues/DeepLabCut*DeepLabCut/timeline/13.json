Everything goes fine and directories of\n_shuffel1 and unaugmented_  are successfully generated.  All 191 frames are\nlabelled, and labels checked with correctness.\n\nI have then run Step 6 to train the Resnet for 10,000 iterations, seeing\nthat the resnet loss gradually decline until 10,000 and then start\ndiverging again.  Thus I break the loop by pressing CTRL_C.  The\npose-tensorflow models directory screen dump, as well as the logs of the\ntraining are attached.  Everything seems to be fine.\n\nWhen I run step 7 according to your instruction for Step 1 evaluation,\nhowever, it is found that the program breaks when it analyzes the first\nimage, with a message of \"Folders already exist\".  Then running step 2 in\nthe evaluation tools give me this abnormal error.  The screen dump is\nattached for reference.\n\nPlease kindly advise.  Deeply appreciate your support.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n2018-06-11 17:21 GMT-07:00 Alexander Mathis <notifications@github.com>:\n\n> My sense is too, that there is no trained network.
