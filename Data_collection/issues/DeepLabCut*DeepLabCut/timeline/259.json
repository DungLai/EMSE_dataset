However, then you want to crop similarly in the future.\nIn your case, I would perhaps create different labels per body part (i.e. leftear_leftmirror, left_ear_middle, etc.) and then from the 2D predictions you can recreate the 3D predictions (through some calibration step). However, you can probably\nalso just use the multiple 2D predictions corresponding to one body-part of the mouse for subsequent analysis without fusing.\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly,\nview it on GitHub, or\nmute the thread.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_AlexEMG_DeepLabCut_issues_259-23issuecomment-2D482498962&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=mrPf8XnQD8FC01Vv7KTxVlu9GWmtAembSBBxUUGYFic&s=2cfgql8OdXxkqdX6VkcB9bKaNdhDyWIGkyl8sYPug3Q&e=>, or mute the thread<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_notifications_unsubscribe-2Dauth_AT4mXoqsnN1Hut8N4zU7eZul0gs3HkHFks5vgEyvgaJpZM4chtTz&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=mrPf8XnQD8FC01Vv7KTxVlu9GWmtAembSBBxUUGYFic&s=pr0YsDc_153dVDNBYPMcI-84U9H1ppJ4FDhftoeYPKA&e=>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/482541747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/491186182","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/259#issuecomment-491186182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/259","id":491186182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTE4NjE4Mg==","user":{"login":"AmandineCornil","id":22766358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzY2MzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22766358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil","html_url":"https://github.com/AmandineCornil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmandineCornil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T07:21:30Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T07:21:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Dear all,\r\n\r\nIs it a way to crop videos for analysis with different x1,x2,y1,y2 values for each video (like in the training)?
