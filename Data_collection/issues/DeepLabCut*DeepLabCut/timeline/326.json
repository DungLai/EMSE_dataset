in case others find this error, please see our [Troubleshooting Tips section](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/wiki/Troubleshooting-Tips) (and search other GitHub issues first). \r\n\r\nsection from https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/wiki/Troubleshooting-Tips reproduced here:\r\n\r\nWeights not downloaded. If you get permission errors FileNotFound (or ValueError: The passed save_path is not a valid checkpoint: xxx\\Deeplabcut\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\models\\pretrained\\resnet_v1_50.ckpt) when you run training, first check if the RestNet weights downloaded.\r\n\r\nThis is an error more common in Windows, but some docker containers might not have admin privileges for this (it can be user specific). They should be under 'init_weights' (see path in the pose_cfg.yaml file). For Windows, also please install GITBASH https://gitforwindows.org/ and OPEN cmd by right-clicking \"run as ADIM\"\r\n\r\nYou can \"cd\" in the terminal to the package location!\r\n\r\ni.e. in linux copy and paste this in: cd usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/\r\n\r\nin Windows: cd C:\\Users\\YourComputerName\\Anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\Lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\models\\pretrained\r\n\r\nAnd if you type \"ls\" to see the list of files, you should see the resnet: resnet_v1_50.ckpt\r\n\r\nIf it is not there, run sudo download.sh then change the permissions: sudo chown yourusername:yourusername resnet_v1_50.ckpt\r\n\r\nSee more tips here: https://github.com/MMathisLab/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0#using-the-docker-for-training-and-video-analysis\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting (2): if it appears the training does not start (i.e. \"Starting training...\" does not print immediately), then you have another session running on your GPU. Go check \"nvidia-smi\" and look at the process names. You can only have 1 per GPU!)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/502476976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
