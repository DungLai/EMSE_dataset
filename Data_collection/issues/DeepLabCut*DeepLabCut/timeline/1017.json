git+https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-core.git@tf2.2alpha\r\npip install tf_slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nand **use the project you already made**, just make a new training_dataset! \r\n\r\n**Here is a

installing a fresh DLC-GPU, I've encountered an issue with GPU. Initially I received an error training, but managed to fix it following this issue, as I'm using RTX 3090: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1017\r\n\r\nHowever, even though I'm able to progress through training without any issues, when I evaluate the network I get an error of roughly 500 pixels in both train and test despite running 100,000 iterations and plateuing at a loss of 0.03. However, all labels are placed in the top left-hand corner. I've tried starting a new project and relabeling, but to no avail. I've also attached a photo. Interestingly, after the first 1000 iterations the terminal outputs an astronomically high error, then drops to 0.12 at 2000.\r\n![Training-Tracking_video2020-11-10T14_41_16-img19450](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50575240/111030683-f11e5f80-8403-11eb-9ddb-0cbcacc64d8a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've previously used DLC without issues. I've even processed videos from an identical setup using older versions of DLC on a windows machine with great results.\r\n\r\nHere's the terminal output:\r\n```\r\nRunning  DLC_resnet_50_GUI_Salient_SNcGiMar12shuffle1_100000  with # of trainingiterations: 100000\r\nInitializing ResNet\r\n\r\nAnalyzing data...\r\n\r\n80it [00:01, 55.81it/s]\r\n\r\nDone and results stored for snapshot:  snapshot-100000\r\n\r\n/home/aske/anaconda3/envs/DLC-GPU/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/evaluate.py:844: \r\nRuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice\r\n\r\n  RMSEpcutoff.iloc[testIndices].values.flatten()\r\n\r\n/home/aske/anaconda3/envs/DLC-GPU/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/evaluate.py:847:\r\n RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice\r\n\r\n  RMSEpcutoff.iloc[trainIndices].values.flatten()\r\n\r\nResults for 100000  training iterations: 95 1 train error: 499.12 pixels.
