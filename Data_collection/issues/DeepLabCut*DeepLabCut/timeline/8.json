As I am trying to find how does the validation error varies with the iterations in order to avoid overfitting, and you don't calculate or print the validation loss during training (just print the training loss, why?), I tried to visualize it after training, but as you don't save all the snapshots, it is not possible to predict labels and calculate the error for them. \r\n**Any idea about where could I change this in order to save all the snapshots?** (keeping the established `save_iters`)\r\nAt the same time, trying to use the test data or validation data I mean during training, I saw that when you generate the `pose_cfg.yaml ` files for train and test using the `Step4_GenerateTrainingFileFromLabelledData_demo`, you target the same dataset (same `.mat ` file) for both training and test files, and this dataset contains only the training data as I understood. \r\nThen, in the `pose_cfg.yaml ` you can see that the `dataset` line is exactly the same for train and test files. This one for the demo:\r\n`dataset: ../../UnaugmentedDataSet_reachingJan30/reaching_Mackenzie95shuffle1.mat`\r\n**Do you have any reason why do you only created a single `.mat ` file for training and test (with the training data only) and why you don't calculate the validation error during training (or where can I find this if I am missing something) ?**  In the paper I see you plot the training and test RMSE against iterations, but in the code I don't find where you save those values during training or save the models (snapshots) to calculate them after training. \r\nThank you very

(from less than 200K to more than 600K iteration with many points in between). Did you just changed the `max_to_keep` to `None` and tested all the models after, or what did you do? \r\n\r\nIn my case, I am training your network with few images of an animal in the wild, and I have seen that I had a better performance for 50K iterations than for 300K to 500K (just five test points between these two values). So, I want to know when the model starts to overfit by graphing the test error as you did.
