However, I didn't notice any issues with creating folders so far, and running DLC1 worked just fine on a conda env with a non-admin user for @wernle and me. The only issues on Windows appeared when trying to use the GUI.\r\n\r\n> providing six yml files, (3 operating platforms and cpu vs gpu).\r\n\r\nConda is all about making things run platform-independently. I don't see why you'd have to create separate yml files for different platforms. I *do* see the need to choose between gpu and cpu though, but that would result in two files only.\r\n\r\n> Well they can certainly join the development channel on slack if they want. It’s open to whomever.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to join the Slack channel; I need to apply by email, right?\r\nI'd be delighted if things like this can also be discussed on the Scientific Community Image Forum (https://forum.image.sc/) that is open for tools like this, and where the discussion would be a bit more visible than in a Slack channel. And if you'd even like to join the forum as a [community partner project](https://forum.image.sc/t/frequently-asked-questions/18729), that would be awesome :-)\r\n\r\nThanks for your great work
