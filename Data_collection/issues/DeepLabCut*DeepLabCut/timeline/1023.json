key error was (the function/method is looking for 'F1' in the h5 but the h5 file has 'ind1')\r\n3) performed the operations of the function line by line from plotting.py to confirm suspicion that the keys expected were being pulled from the config file. \r\n4) individuals = deeplabcut.utils.auxfun_multianimal.IntersectionofIndividualsandOnesGivenbyUser(cfg,displayedindividuals) returns individuals = ['F1', 'F2', 'F3', 'F4', 'F5', 'F6', 'F7', 'F8', 'F9', 'F10']\r\n5) I stopped here because it seems that if the function is using this list of individuals to sort through the .h5 file containing the bodypart positions of the tracked indivuduals, then it will fail due to KeyError.\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-27 at 4 41 31

Or is there an error in how the column headers are getting created/named for the .h5 (and/or pickle)? Since I can't find anyone else posting this issue I feel like it must be the former, but I can't figure it out yet. \r\nFor these steps of the process, I am following the documentation at: https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html (PS this documentation has evolved beautifully. So inspiring)\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
