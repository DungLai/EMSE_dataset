To avoid storing image paths with OS-specific path separators, we got rid of those and decided to store them as tuples in a pandas' hierarchical MultiIndex. It makes it much easier to move projects across multiple platforms. To fix it, the simplest way is to have matching DLC versions; an alternative is to programmatically edit the h5 file, doing the following:\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = pd.read_hdf('h5path')\r\ndf.index = [os.path.join(*row) for row in df.index.to_list()]\r\ndf.to_hdf('h5path_new', key='data')\r\n```\r\nIt simply loads your h5 data, rebuilds the image paths the old way, and writes the data. I would not recommend it though, as I find it simpler and less brittle to update DeepLabCut.\r\nI hope that helps!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1167366468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6885464117,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5MhozezwAAAAGaZ9g1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6885464117","actor":{"login":"KonKob","id":104254966,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjbN9g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104254966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob","html_url":"https://github.com/KonKob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-27T13:39:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6885464128,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5MhozezwAAAAGaZ9hA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6885464128","actor":{"login":"KonKob","id":104254966,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjbN9g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104254966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob","html_url":"https://github.com/KonKob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-27T13:39:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1169617708","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1890#issuecomment-1169617708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1890","id":1169617708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5FtvMs","user":{"login":"KonKob","id":104254966,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjbN9g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104254966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob","html_url":"https://github.com/KonKob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonKob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-29T07:12:46Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T07:12:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
