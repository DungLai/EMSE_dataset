am having the same problem as @heejaeyunajang, my pretrained model already has a `snapshot-1030000`, and increasing  `maxiters` does not seem to help. \r\nCan I roll back to a specific deeplabcut release previous to  #1395 to keep re-training this snapshot with new outlier frames?    \r\nI am using `deeplabcut=2.2.0.3`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1014294206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","id":66069491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDY5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66069491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","html_url":"https://github.com/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5902857148,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c49n2_4zwAAAAFf1nO8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5902857148","actor":{"login":"heejaeyunajang","id":30902301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyMzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30902301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang","html_url":"https://github.com/heejaeyunajang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-17T09:11:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5902857158,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c49n2_4zwAAAAFf1nPG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5902857158","actor":{"login":"heejaeyunajang","id":30902301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyMzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30902301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang","html_url":"https://github.com/heejaeyunajang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heejaeyunajang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-17T09:11:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1014314902","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1557#issuecomment-1014314902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1557","id":1014314902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c48dTeW","user":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"ht

@Guillermo-Hidalgo-Gadea, `max_iters` is automatically capped to the max # of iterations defined in the dlc-models/.../train/pose_cfg.yaml config file.

value yourself; e.g.:\r\n```\r\nmulti_step:\r\n- - 0.005\r\n  - 10000\r\n- - 0.02\r\n  - 430000\r\n- - 0.002\r\n  - 730000\r\n- - 0.001\r\n  - 2000000\r\n```\r\nwould allow you to train up to 2M
