is how you use it:\r\n\r\n```deeplabcut.analyze_videos(path_config_file,[video],save_as_csv=True, dynamic=(True,.1,30))```\r\n\r\nThereby, the triple denotes (state,detectiontreshold,margin). If the state is true, then dynamic cropping will be performed. That means that if an object is detected (i.e. any body part > detectiontreshold), then object boundaries are computed according to the smallest/largest x position and smallest/largest y position of all body parts. This  window is expanded by the margin and from then on only the posture within this crop is analyzed (until the object is lost, i.e. <detectiontreshold). The current position is utilized for updating the crop window, for the next frame (this is why the margin is important and should be set large enough given the movement of the animal).\r\n\r\nEven **on CPU the gains are large**. I.e. on the test video for the openfield given that the mouse is small in relation to the frame, the inference speed goes from ~1.5FPS to around 15FPS on a desktop.... \r\n\r\nSee

you think it would be possible to introduce larger batchsizes for dynamic cropping, if you think this is worthwhile Id be happy to try and implement. I understand the limitation is that each dynamically cropped image has a different resolution and therefore batchwise analysis doesnt make sense however if you were to force all cropped images to be the size of the largest image in the batch then i don't see why not. \r\n\r\nall the best from Australia :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/571988843/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PolarBean","id":38996929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTk2OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38996929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean","html_url":"https://github.com/PolarBean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolarBean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/572004234","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/198#issuecomment-572004234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/198","id":572004234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjAwNDIzNA==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-08T11:14:51Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T11:14:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> however if you were to force all cropped images to be the size of the largest image in the batch then i don't see why not.\r\n\r\nThe issue will be that would end up being just the size of the frame, as the way it works now is if a key point is not found in the cropped area first, then it runs inference over the whole frame to double check for the key point (i.e. the \"standard\" way). \r\n\r\nSo, it would require some thought about how you'd want to implement the batch size, but I think it's a reasonable idea, thanks!
