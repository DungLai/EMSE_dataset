Is the default color the same in the config file (ie hsv)? If you restart the kernel is this a repeatable error? If you hit the right arrow key to advance is there the same error? And, is the body part list formatted correctly? Ie does this work on the demo data in your hands? Also be sure you are up to date with the full 2.0.0 release (ie not a dev version).

We just pinned down to a problem with the extraction of the frames from the video files. \r\n\r\nSince we are trialing our data, we used short videos, with skipped frames.
