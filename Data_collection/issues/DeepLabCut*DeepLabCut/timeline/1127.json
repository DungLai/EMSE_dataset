Yes, the multi animal tracking first outputs a pickle. You need to convert that to tracklets, which makes another pickle, then saving the refined tracklets will create your h5 and

@MMathisLab Thank you for the help. I edited the file paths to make sure that there was a space between My and Drive, and I restarted the project from the beginning to ensure that I had not made an error along the way. Once again,  however, the .h5 and .csv files were not created through running the analyze_videos() functions. I have no idea why this might be occurring. I trained a similar network last year and did not run into this issue. I took screenshots of the outputs from October and the present day, and I observed some differences. For example, I am noticing now that it does not say that csv files are being saved, as it did back in October. Maybe there is something in here that will help you identify the problem. I am using .mp4 files now instead of the .mov files I used previously, so maybe that is contributing to the issues? Another difference is that I am now cropping my videos, whereas previously I did not have to crop them during the analysis step. Here are the screenshots of the outputs below. Let me know if there is anything else I can possibly take a screenshot of or send you to help diagnose the problem.

is a flag (save_as_csv=True), and a checkbox in the GUI to set when calling analyze videos in order to save the output as csv. It's not set to true by default, so that's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nNotice when it loads the video (`Starting to analyze % /content/drive/MyDrive/SAP...`) it still shows no space between My and Drive. That would be the path you are entering for the video itself. My \"concern\" here is that you could actually have two very different folders in your Google Drive: one at `/content/drive/My Drive/`, and one at `/content/drive/MyDrive/`. Since it's finding the videos at `MyDrive`, it should be saving the outputs at `MyDrive`, but you're looking in `My Drive` for the outputs. At least, this would be the case on a local drive. Since this is Google, I'm not sure if `MyDrive` can actually exist (though I suspect it does), and if it does I don't know if you can actually access it. Since it loads the videos, it either does exist and you can't see it, or it doesn't exist and Colab is kindly correcting the typo by remapping the file load with the space, but it may not be so kind when writing new files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/791541588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/791593258","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1127#issuecomment-791593258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1127","id":791593258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTU5MzI1OA==","user":{"login":"withercp","id":70550808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTUwODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70550808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp","html_url":"https://github.com/withercp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withercp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T18:13:43Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T18:13:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for pointing out that there were still places in the code where I omitted the space between My and Drive!
