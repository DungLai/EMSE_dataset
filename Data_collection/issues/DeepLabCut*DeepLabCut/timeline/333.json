you. Sorry for not placing this comment in the right area.\r\n\r\nSo the confusion came from following the instructions exactly from this tutorial page:\r\nhttps://github.com/MMathisLab/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0\r\n\r\nI went into the terminal as described and set the DLClight. But then I was trying to work from the Jupyter notebook. I didn’t know that you had to set the DLClight from within the notebook.\r\n\r\nYour notebook though explains that and now I’m training. So thanks!\r\nMaybe link to the that notebook from the page above (https://github.com/MMathisLab/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0) and clarify that if you use the notebook, you need to set from within it? For future users. I’m set now.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I had the problem with the resnet weights permission and worked through it. I’m using Linux Deep Learning AWS 20.0.\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard work and sharing this with us all.\r\n-Alex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Mathis Lab <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To:
