We compute the Euclidean distance for any pair of 2D points (e.g. human vs. predicted). This matrix (indexed by image & body part) is then averaged. In the paper we write: \"To compare between datasets generated by the human scorer, as well as with or between model-generated labels, we used the Euclidean distance (root mean square error, RMSE) calculated pairwise per body part. Depending on the context, this metric is either shown for a specific body part, averaged over all body parts, or averaged over a set of images.\"\r\n\r\nSo (at least) there it is clear that we actually take the mean of the Euclidean distances, for which \"Mean Absolute Error\" / or \"Mean absolute Euclidean distance\" would have been a better name. However, the name in the paper was based on the misleading equivalence of \"Euclidean distance (root mean square error, RMSE)\", which obviously differ by sqrt(2). We will clarify the names in a future update. We think the mean of the Euclidean distances is a better evaluation metric than the RMSE of the Euclidean distances. Note that during training the \"RMSE\" is not minimized, so this only affects the evaluation.
