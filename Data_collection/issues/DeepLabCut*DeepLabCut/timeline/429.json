Thanks for bringing this to my attention!\r\n\r\n@eleonoreduroyon, I have a couple of suggestions. First, you could try decreasing the process_ratio variable in deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/dataset/pose_dataset_tensorpack.py. The default is set to 6, which is relatively high, so you could begin by training your network with a process ratio of 1 or 2. \r\n\r\nIf you continue getting the same error after decreasing the process ratio, here’s something else you can try. There is a warning at the top of your second image that mentions starting a process with ‘fork’ may consume extra memory, and suggests using ‘forkserver/spawn’ instead. It points you to this link to find out more: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods. You can use this library to change the start process to ‘forkserver/spawn’. Alternatively, you could navigate to the directory where you have Tensorpack installed, then go to /tensorpack/utils/concurrency.py and manually change the start process from ‘fork’ to ‘forkserver/spawn’. \r\n\r\nHopefully this helps, let me know if you are still running into problems after trying these.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/536098762/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"katierupp","id":48692614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjkyNjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48692614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp","html_url":"https://github.com/katierupp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katierupp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2669918536,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2OTkxODUzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2669918536","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T21:14:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2669918538,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2Njk5MTg1Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2669918538","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T21:14:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2669918540,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2OTkxODU0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2669918540","actor":{"login":"eleonoreduroyon","id":32446840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ2ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32446840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon","html_url":"https://github.com/eleonoreduroyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T21:14:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2669918542,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2Njk5MTg1NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2669918542","actor"

I don't see why I can't change the values of processratio in pose_dataset_tensorpack.py or /tensorpack/utils/concurrency.py.\r\n The computer I am using is new, I added below a screenshot of its general overview.If setting deterministic works, why wouldn't tensorpack not work?\r\nThe biggest frame size is :1920x1080. Is that too big? \r\n\r\n@MMathisLab: Will do, thank you for clarifying that!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-10-01
