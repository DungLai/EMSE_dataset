When the pandas arrays are concatenated, they will be concatenated along columns as you have different scorer names (thus, concat by rows doesn't work). When you then create a training set only the scorer name from the config file is used, see here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/trainingsetmanipulation.py#L972\r\nI suppose that name is Serena in your project... \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can fix this by renaming all the annotated data frames to one name. Then you create the training set and you should be fine. You can also do this automatically, we should actually write a cookbook recipe on how to merge datasets from different people!\r\n\r\nHere is a helper function that can rename body parts:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom deeplabcut.utils import auxiliaryfunctions, auxfun_models, auxfun_multianimal\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\nimport os\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n############### FOR RENAMING body parts\r\ndef rename_bodyparts(config, pairs):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Rename bodyparts for list of pairs, e.g. [['snout','nose']] rename snout to nose!\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    cfg = auxiliaryfunctions.read_config(config)\r\n    videos = cfg[\"video_sets\"].keys()\r\n    video_names = [Path(i).stem for i in videos]\r\n    folders = [Path(config).parent / \"labeled-data\" / Path(i) for i in video_names]\r\n    dict_ = {k: v for k, v in pairs}\r\n\r\n    for folder in folders:\r\n        filename = os.path.join(str(folder), \"CollectedData_\" + cfg[\"scorer\"] + \".h5\")\r\n        df = pd.read_hdf(filename, \"df_with_missing\")\r\n        print(df.head())\r\n        df.rename(dict_, level=\"bodyparts\", axis=1, inplace=True)\r\n        df.to_hdf(filename, \"df_with_missing\",format=\"table\", mode=\"w\")\r\n        df.to_csv(filename.split('.h5')[0]+\".csv\")\r\n\r\n#run function to rename all snouts to noses ... \r\nrename_bodyparts(path_config_file,  [['snout','nose']])\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor your case, just adapt \r\n`df.rename(dict_, level=\"bodyparts\", axis=1, inplace=True)`\r\nto relabel the level with the scorer and make a new function for renaming the scorer. @jeylau let's add something like this to the recipes.
