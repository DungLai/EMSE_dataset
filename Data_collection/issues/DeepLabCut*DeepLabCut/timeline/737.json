Setting it in the main config.yaml should be enough.\r\n\r\n^ this is just your opinion, and I think you've proven the point that making it easy to switch will cause issues if someone doesn't know what else they need to do. Hence, I disagree with your opinion that we did it wrong. You're welcome for the free code, btw! \r\n\r\nFor more information:
