I have not benchmarked multi-CPU use, but but my understanding is that multi CPU use does not scale, as one expects naively (and only mildly improves performance for ResNets, see table 7 in [Benchmarking State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Software Tools](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07249.pdf)). I would recommend single GPUs.
