At first I thought the number of iterations were too low, so I left the program run with 100.000 iterations to make sure that wasn't the problem. However, when I analyze the video, the full.mp4 file video shows tracking for around 1-2 seconds and then it disappears. It happened for all the previous trials. Of course this leads to empty tracklets or 1-2 seconds tracking when refining them. Any solution?\r\nI don't know if this could be useful, but when I tried to plot the maps, I got another error on the way. I'll post both error.\r\n\r\nP.S.

to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Analyze video'\r\n2. Click on 'Select video' (.mp4)\r\n3. Click Step 1: analyze video\r\n4. Click Step 2: convert into tracklets\r\n5. When proceeding to refining tracklets, I launch GUI and I can only see/refine 1-2 seconds of the video (with less iteration, 20.000 for instance, I could not even see this and the \"OSError: tracklets are empty\" error showed up)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75975343/102067968-1d721200-3dfc-11eb-91d8-2db409fe8f5d.png)\r\n![Screenshot
