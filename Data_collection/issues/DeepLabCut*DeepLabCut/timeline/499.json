I found that when I executed \"export DLClight=True\" in the conda environment, I could import deeplabcut successfully. As you say, it now runs in light-mode, which I don't totally understand at this point. However, so long as I do most things off the cluster (e.g., label videos) and only do the training on the cluster, that should work.
