I would try a couple of things: \r\n1. try to analyze just one of the problematic videos, not the full folder of videos. This would help isolate any kind of memory leak or file opening/releasing issue. \r\n2. [Re-encode](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/recipes/io.html?highlight=encode#tips-on-video-re-encoding-and-preprocessing) one of the problematic videos. ffmpeg should be installed with DLC - as a disclaimer, I've never worked with a linux cluster, or with a Docker install, so I'm not sure you can \"use\" the ffmpeg, but it is installed if DLC is running. If you can't access it, pull the video to a local computer where you have dlc (or just install ffmpeg), re-encode, and try analysis again.\r\n\r\nAs a general note, some cameras produce videos that opencv regularly has difficulty with (either with the file header, metadata, or audio stream). Re-encoding has always fixed it for me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1170359919/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1191165500","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1882#issuecomment-1191165500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1882","id":1191165500,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5G_748","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-21T07:55:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T07:55:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Indeed -- I think this is a file-corruption rather than a DLC bug (as for others + other videos it's fine).
