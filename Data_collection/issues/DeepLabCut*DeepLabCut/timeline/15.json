Naturally, these *new* frames will not have labels in the csv file that DeepLabCut ships with. If you then proceedto Step2 & 3 the labels will not be correctly linked to corresponding frames. Is that what you did?\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is why in the [readme](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/README.md) we state: \"If you want to run the code on our demo video, a mouse reaching video from Mathis et al., 2017, you will NOT run code from sections (0), (1), or (2) below, as we have created labels for this video already (and e.g. (0) will extract different frames that are thus not labeled).\"\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/397061260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/397063686","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/15#issuecomment-397063686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/15","id":397063686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzA2MzY4Ng==","user":{"login":"cchamber","id":8458570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTg1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8458570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber","html_url":"https://github.com/cchamber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchamber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T19:51:25Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T19:51:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
