Note that you cannot be in multiple environments simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThus, when you ```conda activate tensorflow```, you are leaving the DLCdependencies environment. Thus, moviepy, easydict etc. (which are installed in this environment), but not canonically in your tensorflow environments are missing. \r\n\r\nThus, if you want *TensorFlow* and everything else in one environment then consider using:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/dlcDependenciesFORWINDOWSwTF.yaml\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could have installed *TensorFlow* in the
