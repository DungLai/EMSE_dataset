Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI wanted to be able to do some hacking in the DLC code (related to #2036; specifically, adding an option to pass a manually-chosen list of frames for refinement via cli), so I tried to make a developer install. I removed the `deeplabcut` requirement from the yaml, made a conda env with everything *except* deeplabcut, then ran `pip install -e \".[tf]\"` from within the cloned directory to install dlc. (I'm on a CLI so no gui.)This almost worked perfectly, except I got an odd unexpected error. Running `import deeplabcut` from a python interpreter gave an error about circular imports, but then it succeeds the second time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-10 14:02:49.250879: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA\r\nTo enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.\r\n2022-11-10 14:02:49.370427: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on.

I noticed the version of DLC differs between the normal and the dev versions: the normal one I just cloned says `Loading DLC 2.2.3...` vs `Loading DLC 2.3rc2...` in the development version. But I made both from the same clone which I grabbed just an hour ago! So I'm confused as to how they can have different versions. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's a better way to run DLC in dev mode so that I can run tests and contribute :)\n\n### Operating System\n\nNAME=\"CentOS Linux\"\r\nVERSION=\"7 (Core)\"\r\nID=\"centos\"\r\nID_LIKE=\"rhel fedora\"\r\nVERSION_ID=\"7\"\r\nPRETTY_NAME=\"CentOS Linux 7 (Core)\"\r\n\r\n3.10.0-1160.76.1.el7.x86_64\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.3 / 2.3rc2\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nYAML file (can't put yamls on gh so here it is as a txt): [DEEPLABCUT_dev.txt](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/9983938/DEEPLABCUT_dev.txt)\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nconda env create -f DEEPLABCUT_dev.yaml\r\ncd [your dlc clone]\r\npip install -e \".[tf]\"\r\ncd [anywhere other than the dlc directory]\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT_dev\r\npython\r\n>> import deeplabcut\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1310777126","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2036#issuecomment-1310777126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2036","id":1310777126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5OIN8m","user":{"login":"jonahpearl","id":68478436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDc4NDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68478436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl","html_url":"https://github.com/jonahpearl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpearl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T19:12:47Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T19:12:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the fast response and the fix! I can confirm this fix works for me, after I added a few things. This was missing implementation for the \"uniform\" extraction algorithm, which is what I'd like to use (just need to add it to the other half of the if/else.) I'd also love to be able to pass a list of frame numbers manually (basically manual, but with no gui). I implemented these changes in my own version of the code, but I'm having some trouble running a developer version of DLC to test it (see #2044; oddly the same issue about getting the wrong dlc version happens when I run `python testscripts_cli.py`, even from the environment where it otherwise works). I will open a PR anyways and you all can test on your end if possible.
