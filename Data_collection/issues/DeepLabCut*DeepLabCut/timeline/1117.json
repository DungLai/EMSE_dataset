Duration and bitrate are unknown. After reencoding this metadata probably gets corrected by the encoder. \r\n\r\nDepending on the encoder you used when recording videos there might issues with proper frame indexing and other metadata if your avi file is larger than 2 or 4 GB. It usually easily gets solved by reencoding - hence why it worked for you. I would advise to go for mp4 encoded with libx265 (considering your resolution) with crf 18, veryfast preset. You should obtain high compression without perceivable loss of quality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/780887320/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/782034057","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1117#issuecomment-782034057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1117","id":782034057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjAzNDA1Nw==","user":{"login":"ashwin-miriyala","id":50625947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjI1OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50625947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwin-miriyala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T12:05:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T12:05:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
