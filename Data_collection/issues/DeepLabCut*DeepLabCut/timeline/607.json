The default is ``.avi``\r\n\r\n   shuffle : int, optional\r\n       The shufle index of training dataset. The extracted frames will be stored in the labeled-dataset for\r\n       the corresponding shuffle of training dataset. Default is set to 1\r\n\r\n trainingsetindex: int, optional\r\n       Integer specifying which TrainingsetFraction to use. By default the first (note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml).\r\n\r\n   outlieralgorithm: 'fitting', 'jump', 'uncertain', or 'manual'\r\n       String specifying the algorithm used to detect the outliers. Currently, deeplabcut supports three methods + a manual GUI option. 'Fitting'\r\n       fits a Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model to the data and computes the distance to the estimated data. Larger distances than\r\n       epsilon are then potentially identified as outliers. The methods 'jump' identifies larger jumps than 'epsilon' in any body part; and 'uncertain'\r\n       looks for frames with confidence below p_bound. The default is set to ``jump``.\r\n\r\n   comparisonbodyparts: list of strings, optional\r\n       This select the body parts for which the comparisons with the outliers are carried out. Either ``all``, then all body parts\r\n       from config.yaml are used orr a list of strings that are a subset of the full list.\r\n       E.g. ['hand','Joystick'] for the demo Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/config.yaml to select only these two body parts.\r\n\r\n   p_bound: float between 0 and 1, optional\r\n       For outlieralgorithm 'uncertain' this parameter defines the likelihood below, below which a body part will be flagged as a putative outlier.\r\n\r\n   epsilon; float,optional\r\n       Meaning depends on outlieralgoritm. The default is set to 20 pixels.\r\n       For outlieralgorithm 'fitting': Float bound according to which frames are picked when the (average) body part estimate deviates from model fit\r\n       For outlieralgorithm 'jump': Float bound specifying the distance by which body points jump from one frame to next (Euclidean distance)\r\n\r\n   ARdegree: int, optional\r\n       For outlieralgorithm 'fitting': Autoregressive degree of ARIMA model degree. (Note we use SARIMAX without exogeneous and seasonal part)\r\n       see https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\r\n\r\n   MAdegree: int\r\n       For outlieralgorithm 'fitting': MovingAvarage degree of ARIMA model degree. (Note we use SARIMAX without exogeneous and seasonal part)\r\n       See https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\r\n\r\n   alpha: float\r\n       Significance level for detecting outliers based on confidence interval of fitted ARIMA model. Only the distance is used however.\r\n\r\n   extractionalgorithm : string, optional\r\n       String specifying the algorithm to use for selecting the frames from the identified putatative outlier frames. Currently, deeplabcut\r\n       supports either ``kmeans`` or ``uniform`` based selection (same logic as for extract_frames).\r\n       The default is set to``uniform``, if provided it must be either ``uniform`` or ``kmeans``.\r\n\r\n   automatic : bool, optional\r\n       Set it to True, if you want to extract outliers without being asked for user feedback.\r\n\r\n   cluster_resizewidth: number, default: 30\r\n       For k-means one can change the width to which the images are downsampled (aspect ratio is fixed).\r\n\r\n cluster_color: bool, default: False\r\n       If false then each downsampled image is treated as a grayscale vector (discarding color information). If true, then the color channels are considered. This increases\r\n       the computational complexity.\r\n\r\n   opencv: bool, default: True\r\n       Uses openCV for loading & extractiong (otherwise moviepy (legacy))\r\n\r\n   savelabeled: bool, default: True\r\n       If true also saves frame with predicted labels in each folder.\r\n\r\n   destfolder: string, optional\r\n       Specifies the destination folder that was used for storing analysis data (default is the path of the video).\r\n\r\n   Examples\r\n\r\n   Windows example for extracting the frames with default settings\r\n   >>>

On day 1, the aperture is set to normal and the videos are tracked extremely well by DLC. On day 2, I set the aperture very high (i.e. the videos have high contrast) because I thought it would make certain features stand out more and make for easier tracking by DLC. I found that the videos from day 2 are not nearly tracked as well as the videos from day 1. I have trained DLC on the same number of videos from day 1 and day 2 so it shouldn't be a training issue.

I now have a machine-labeles-iter0.h5 file saved right in my labeled-data folder! I really want to thank you for your patience with a coding noob like myself hehe :) \r\n\r\nI do have one more question if you have a spare moment! Once I refine the extracted outlier frames and retrain the network, can I add more manually tracked videos at a later date and then train the network again? The reason I ask is because we take videos at different time points during recovery from spinal cord injury and I want to keep up with analyzing the videos as I take them. So let's say I manually track videos from week 1 after injury, train the network on iteration-0, extract outlier frames, refine the outlier frames, and retrain the network on iteration-1. Can I then add manually tracked videos from week 2 using the add_new_videos() function and then go through the whole cycle again (i.e. train the network on iteration-1, extract outlier frames, refine the outlier frames, and retrain the network on iteration-2)?

You can add more videos always, as exactly as you describe.  add videos, then extract, label, and then run \"merge_datasets\" which will make a new iteration, then run create_training_set, then train, etc...
