the problem. Here, the landmarks and other single bodyparts were visible in the GUI and in the h5 output file.\r\n\r\nBut when setting the params as following:\r\nmin_swap_len = 0\r\nmin_tracklet_len = 2\r\nmax_gap = 0\r\nI only could see the multianimal labels in the tracklet GUI and similarly in the h5 output file.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIsa","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/684841038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imgross","id":36044114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ0MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36044114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross","html_url":"https://github.com/imgross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3714850458,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzcxNDg1MDQ1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3714850458","actor":{"login":"imgross","id":36044114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ0MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36044114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross","html_url":"https://github.com/imgross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgross/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T13:10:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3714850476,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcxNDg1MDQ3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3714850476","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T13:10:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3714850478,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MTQ4NTA0Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3714850478","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-01T13:10:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
