I'll give it a try today.\r\n\r\n> also, any pref for why at the bottom as it is now is not ideal?\r\n\r\nCurrently when you hit save it replaces the video name. In terms of workflow usually I label all of the frames, instinctively hit save, and then try to figure out what the next video I should load is.

Besides that, it's nice to have important information in a focused area of the screen so I'm not looking around too much. There's definitely some eye strain when you have to move your eyes between corners/sides a lot (another reason hotkeys are great - less looking for buttons when you're doing 200+ frames over 40+ videos).\r\n\r\n> if you want to put it somewhere else, drag it! :)\r\n\r\nI was going to mention the drag behavior isn't very responsive, but that seemed difficult to fix (figured it was a limitation of the current UI framework). When I try to drag a bodypart I have to sort of coax it in circles around where I want it to go. It's hard to get it to the exact spot I want so often I just delete the label, go to the next image, go back, then readd it.
