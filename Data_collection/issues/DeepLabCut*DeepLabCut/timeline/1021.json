There are two things possible; 1 is to actually train the network to guess - if you want to track obstructions, and you can guess, i.e. do the refinement, merge them in and re-train. Namely, when you label you can teach the network to guess; another is to of course as you suggest, \"externally\" manually correct frames as you want. \r\n\r\nWe have a tracklet GUI for maDLC that allows this, but could be repurposed for this task if you want to hack it (or the refinement GUI for that matter). We don't have time right now (and it's a bit beyond the scope of DLC since what we want to give you is the best pose estimation tools, but leave post-processing elsewhere :)\r\n\r\nHope that helps!
