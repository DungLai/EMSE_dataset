But I tested with true and false in the config.yaml\r\n\r\nI attached my train.py file (I deleted the non effnets models down below). I generally train with a 90/10 split but the rest are default parameters. Only the ones are changed that are specified in the train script. Could you maybe run it and see if it produces the same offset results? Maybe with less shuffles and iterations (shuffle=1 and max_iteration=10000 should be enough to see if you run into the same problems, maybe even less)\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am having problems with tensorflow and out-of-memory errors. Do you think that you also be related to a DLC bug? It suddenly occurred a few days ago after upgrading to 2.2.1, so I thought that this might be related? If yes, I can open a new issue for this.\r\n\r\n@MMathisLab I will test check_labels soon and let you know!\r\n\r\nP.S.

thanks again for the reply!:)\r\n\r\nI checked out the model comparison function before, but since there were a few options missing (e.g. crop method and size) and I thought that it is not useable with the dlcrnet etc. because the explanation is an older one, I thought that I am better off with the other create_multiple_trainingsets function. My purpose was to get a feeling of the different performances and I thought it might be enough to check if the training/testing sets are similar to compare the models approx. But you are right, I cannot really compare the models like that. Changed it now and I can still access the yaml file by loading them in the script and automatically changing the parameter in there. \r\n\r\nRegarding the cropping approach. I didnt get the expected results with hybrid and then changed the cropping to keypoints and before density. The reason why is that there is a lot space where no fish aka no keypoints are. I worried that applying hybrid (which contains uniform cropping) might lead to too many crops without any data and is overrepresented. But I will test with hybrid again.\r\n\r\nThe tensorflow error was caused by a overloaded cluster, I think. Everything works now. Sorry!\r\n\r\nI will wait to see if/how the performance of the efficientnets is influenced by the new settings and then check out the tuning!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your helpful comments! It is very appreciated:).
