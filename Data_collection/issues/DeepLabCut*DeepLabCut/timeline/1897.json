Multiprocessing's behavior is also OS-specific, which makes matters worse. Instead of writing custom queues or pools, it's perhaps simpler to rather increase `batch_size` in the config.yaml to accelerate inference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1191183690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7036079691,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5NP_28zwAAAAGjYg5L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7036079691","actor":{"login":"LucaH285","id":57685695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg1Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57685695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaH285","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T08:14:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7036079700,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5NP_28zwAAAAGjYg5U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7036079700","actor":{"login":"LucaH285","id":57685695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg1Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57685695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaH285","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T08:14:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1194739275","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1897#issuecomment-1194739275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1897","id":1194739275,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5HNkZL","user":{"login":"LucaH285","id":57685695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg1Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57685695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaH285","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:56:08Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T22:56:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @jeylau thanks for the tip, I'll try that out! One other solution I came up with (given that our analysis strictly concerns itself with positional tracking) was downsizing the videos from their recorded 1080p resolution to 360p, really sped everything up without messing with the fidelity of data gathering. I imagine this approach would not work with something like fine motor movements in grabbing behaviour, so I'll try the batch size in the future, thanks again!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1194739275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LucaH285","id":57685695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg1Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57685695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaH285","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7060329770,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5NP_28zwAAAAGk1BUq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7060329770","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7060329778,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5NP_28zwAAAAGk1BUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7060329778","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7060333416,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5BM6c5NP_28zwAAAAGk1CNo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7060333416","actor":{"login":"LucaH285","id":57685695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg1Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57685695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaH285","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaH285/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T22:56:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
