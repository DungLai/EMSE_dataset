Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Bug description\r\n\r\nWe (@auesro and me) are using maDLC for single animal videos and we found two, maybe related, problems after running `analyze_videos` :\r\n\r\n1. The function `extract_outlier_frames` says: \r\n```\r\nAnalyzing all the videos in the directory...\r\nNo unfiltered data file found in /content/drive/Shareddrives/Computational_Neuro_IP-AER/Test_maDLC_multi_2/singleanimal-IsabelP-2022-03-24/videos for video 8-2-2021_Chloroquine_19 and scorer DLC_dlcrnetms5_singleanimalMar24shuffle1_100000 and ellipse tracker.\r\nIt seems the video has not been analyzed yet, or the video is not found! You can only refine the labels after the a video is analyzed. Please run 'analyze_video' first. Or, please double check your video file path\r\n```\r\n2. After running the function `find_outliers_in_raw_data` (recently fixed by @jeylau #1778), the function `refine_labels` opens the GUI but it does not find any frames to correct (apparently the GUI is looking for a `machinelabels-iter0.h5` file which is not in the folder).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro and COLAB\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut version\r\n\r\nDLC 2.2.0.1\r\n\r\n### DeepLabCut mode\r\n\r\nmulti animal\r\n\r\n### Device type\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Quadro P2000\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1233517963","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1778#issuecomment-1233517963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1778","id":1233517963,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5Jhf2L","user":{"login":"sherr-an","id":60992582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTkyNTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60992582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an","html_url":"https://github.com/sherr-an","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherr-an/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-31T22:56:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T22:56:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I am encountering same issues when creating training dataset. \r\n\r\n**- TypeError: join() argument must be str or bytes, not 'tuple'**\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, I transferred previously labeled data (Windows) to GPU that has DeepLabCut docker version.
