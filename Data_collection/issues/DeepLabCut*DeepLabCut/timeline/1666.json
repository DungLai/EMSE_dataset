never had this problem on my Windows set up.  But your GPU is maxed out - you can see that it is having to access shared GPU memory (using RAM as GPU memory). \r\nYou have only 8GB GPU memory, and it looks like that's the only GPU in the machine so some gets used for other apps and functions (DLC is getting only 5.4 GB). Try quitting everything except DLC, even closing background processes if possible.\r\nThen make sure `batchsize` in `config.yaml` or in your call to analyze videos is 1. \r\nThe kernel crash may be some kind of memory management problem that's not necessarily connected to the GPU installation.\r\n\r\nOther than shifting to shared GPU memory, I don't see any indication that the GPU is leading to the original problem, so some other thoughts, none of which should cause a kernel crash, but are worth checking out:\r\n\r\nIs there any indication it's a specific video file that causes the problems? Does it always stop on the same video? \r\nWhat resolution are your videos? Are they all the same resolution? Can you get it to analyze that video if that's the only one you pass to `analyze_videos`? If you remove that video from the folder will it continue?\r\n\r\nMake sure you don't have analysis outputs for the videos (since DLC will not re-analyze videos).\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1031648609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1032583280","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1666#issuecomment-1032583280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1666","id":1032583280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c49i_hw","user":{"login":"anagigoncalves","id":85490532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDkwNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85490532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves","html_url":"https://github.com/anagigoncalves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T13:01:38Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T13:01:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`batchsize` set to 1 worked - thanks a lot! \r\n\r\nI had completely forgot about it as we trained and analyzed videos on the old GPU always with `batchsize` 8 without any problems.\r\n\r\nThank you for all the support, this issue actually made me realize the kind of GPU we have and how we can improve our whole tracking system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1032583280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anagigoncalves","id":85490532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDkwNTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85490532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves","html_url":"https://github.com/anagigoncalves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagigoncalves/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
