When I converted to maDLC project and created a multianimal training set, the iteration number did not increase. So new checkpoints were written into a previously occupied training folder. This caused a problem later because during analysis the previous checkpoints (which went up to 730000 iterations) were loaded rather than the last multianimal checkpoint.\r\n2. It appears that when I used cropimagesandlabels, the first video in my config file was processed correctly, but there was an error in the accompanying config file changes. The first video entry in video_sets wasn't changed to a cropped suffix and the cropping parameters weren't changed. I changed this manually. \r\nI got around these, but they may be worth a second look to see if things are working as expected during those steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/831647013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kevinbolding","id":9322812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMjI4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9322812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinbolding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbolding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4681919474,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0NjgxOTE5NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4681919474","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-04T08:15:52Z","assignee":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/831764925","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1215#issuecomment-831764925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1215","id":831764925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTc2NDkyNQ==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-04T08:19:05Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T08:19:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just re: 1.: this is intended.

I agree we can add a feature to use a single animal only again, but really using EfficientNets for single animal is truly smarter; it's computationally more complex to do multi-animal, and as we describe in the paper, the only advantage is when animals are very close. \r\n\r\nFrom the blog:\r\n\r\n🥇 **Is multi-animal truly good for your problem?** We saw many animals that were easily visually distinguishable being used with #maDLC beta, which by default has the strong assumption there should be no unique visual properties. Even two mice with one having a marked tail violates this assumption, unless you use our ID network output (see next point).\r\n\r\n> The ultimate issue is that I cannot understand how to get a continuous single-animal location prediction for all frames. I have been searching the gitter and issues extensively. I believe my issue may have similarities with issue #949 or issue #827.\r\n\r\nThis is completely different from beta to now; so it's really not relevant. \r\n\r\n> The video created with all detections after analysis looks good to me except there are extraneous labels outside the arena. In particular, the tailbase is nearly constantly labeled. This should be visible and easy for the tracklets to follow, although this is really where my lack of understanding about how pose estimates turn into tracklets really shows.\r\n\r\nMay I ask, did you read the paper? All the methods are fully described. \r\n\r\n> My skeleton is overcomplete but not exhaustive. I see this as a first suggestion on many issues. One thing that is unclear about this is whether you really mean literally that every part should be connected to every other part. If that is so, why not automatically/programmatically do so instead of having user input? I am attaching a screenshot of my skeleton below.\r\n\r\nPlease read the new docs, and the paper, and the blog clearly described this is no longer needed, btw. Here is an excerpt from the blog. And please we worked really hard on this, and the little we ask is for a doc check ;), then we are happy to help. \r\n\r\nBLOG: http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcutblog/2021/4/2/multi-animal-deeplabcut-the-full-22-release\r\n\r\nPAPER: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.442096v1.full.pdf\r\n\r\n🗝 **The skeleton, you need(ed) to over-connect…** And when we mean over-connect, we really meant everything to everything is best. Now, we (1) take this decision away from the user, and (2) introduce a novel fully-data driven approach. Using your data, we now find the ultimate skeleton for your data to get the best performance with the best speed.

I think the following statements from[ this part of the docs](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/UseOverviewGuide.md) are what led me to think the multi-animal model was the correct choice. Advanced tracking features and updated network capabilities are altogether too enticing to resist.\r\n\r\n> 💜 DLC 2.2: as of 2.2 we support \"multi-animal projects,\" but these new features can also be used on single animals too (details below). The workflow is highly similar, but with a few key additional steps. Please carefully review the functions below for more details. You can search/look for maDeepLabCut for specific steps that are changed, or see this more comprehensive guide here\r\n\r\n> What scenario do you have?\r\n> I have single animal videos, but I want to use the advanced tracking features & updated network capabilities introduced (for multi-animal projects) in DLC2.2:\r\n> quick start: when you create_new_project just set the flag

you for the 2.2rc1 release - it is amazing so far! \r\n\r\n**Your Operating system and DeepLabCut version**\r\nWindows 10\r\nDeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc1\r\nAnaconda env DLC-GPU\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\n\r\nI previously trained maDLC 2.2b8 to track the behavior of one animal in an open field. With the upgrade, I labeled some more images and trained a new iteration. Using the GUI, when I try to refine tracklets with the ellipse or skeleton method, I get an error during stitching for the shape of passed values. When I use the box method, it works beautifully, but half way through the video all of the labels on the one mouse switch from being indiv1 to indiv2. This is potentially related to  #1215, although this post does not reference any value errors for the other tracking methods. Since multi-animal is now optimized for 2-14 animals, do you recommend switching to a single animal project? I really appreciate all the work that has gone into this release and your advice on this issue. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Please place code inside this: </summary><p>\r\n<br>\r\nC:\\Users\\rog8777\\Anaconda3\\envs\\DLC-GPU\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\refine_training_dataset\\stitch.py:634: UserWarning: No optimal solution found.
