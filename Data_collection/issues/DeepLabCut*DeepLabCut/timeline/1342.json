you for the fast response!! :) Sorry for being imprecise, the version I'm using is 2.1.10.2 !\r\n\r\nWhat I did was:\r\n- Manually extract additional frames\r\n- saw that two frames were truncated and deleted them out of the folder\r\n- ran deeplabcut.dropannotationfileentriesduetodeletedimages(config), which successfully changed the csv and h5 file\r\n- opened the labeling gui with deeplabcut.label_frames()\r\n- label a previously unlabelled frame\r\n- clicked save, then quit\r\n- re-open the same folder in the labeling gui -> here, for me, the changes i just made are now gone...\r\n\r\nIs there anything else i can upload that would be any help at all?\r\n\r\nSince i manually extracted 160 frames i'm trying to avoid re-doing it (so deleting this folder and the video path out of the config file, perhaps renaming the original video, adding it to the project again, extracting all the frames again manually, labelling them), but apart from being quite time-consuming i
