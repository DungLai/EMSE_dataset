This is what seemed to be causing Colab to crash.\r\n\r\nRemoving the six~=1.11.0 requirement from DLC setup.py seems to have solved the issue for me (which forced an installation of version 1.11). Although a more permanent fix could be a change in the requirement to six~=1.12.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not familiar with the DLC code to understand the possible implications of using six 1.12 over 1.11. \r\n\r\nWould someone be able to tell me if there are any possible groundbreaking issues with using version 1.12 of six? My code appears to be running fine at the moment with version 1.12.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/536973272/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jonathan-Oehley","id":43063798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYzNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43063798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley","html_url":"https://github.com/Jonathan-Oehley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jonathan-Oehley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/537137485","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/433#issuecomment-537137485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/433","id":537137485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzEzNzQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T17:17:07Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T17:17:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As far as I can tell the six update is fine!
