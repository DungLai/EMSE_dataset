For other's interested, here's what I've figure out.\r\n\r\nPrior to dlc 2.2rc3, deeplabcut could install and run in anaconda using rosetta2.\r\ndeeplabcut 2.2rc3 requires tensorflow 2.5, but there isn't a rosetta2 emulator version available.\r\n\r\nSo, you can install miniforge to replace conda, which will then grab non emulated ARM versions of packages (it still uses conda commands) and the apple alpha release of tf 2.5 following [these instructions](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/). But that version of tf won't be recognized by pip when installing deeplabcut and creates a dependency problem.\r\n\r\nSo I installed what I could of the dlc dependencies via miniforge conda, and the rest via pip.  This let me import deeplabcut in pythonw, but it only imported in light mode. \r\n\r\nI tried to run the test script, but got the very interesting error below.

Based on the following, I've gotten DLC training and video analysis to engage the M1 GPU.  However, there are a few problems:\r\n1. DLC only imports in `lite` mode (no GUIs)\r\n2. any function that engages the GPU triggers a segmentation fault when it finishes:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeeplabcut.evaluate_network(config)\r\nRunning  DLC_resnet50_TESTJul12shuffle1_5  with # of trainingiterations: 5\r\n/Users/brandonjackson/opt/miniforge3/envs/tftest/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer_v1.py:1692: UserWarning: `layer.apply` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

Install homebrew, and once that's installed run `brew install ffmpeg`. For some reason, the ARM capable opencv packages only look for certain libraries in `opt/homebrew/...` I tried creating those directories and shortcuts to conda ffmpeg, but that didn't work. \r\n2. Install miniforge as described [here](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/153). It was a little tricky to get the zsh path to see it rather than Miniconda, but there's lots of help online. Basically you have to make sure miniforge installs in the user's opt folder, then manually edit the .zshrc paths from miniconda to miniforge.\r\n3. Once the \"sanity checks\" pass, don't follow the rest of those directions to install TensorFlow in an env because it clashes with DLC dependencies, rather:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda create -n tftest python=3.9\r\nconda activate tftest\r\nconda install -c apple tensorflow-deps\r\npython -m pip install tensorflow-macos\r\npython -m pip install tensorflow-metal\r\nconda install python.app filterpy ruamel.yaml imgaug numba scikit-image scikit-learn statsmodels tqdm moviepy jupyter nb_conda\r\npython -m pip install tensorpack tf_slim tables\r\npython -m pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2rc3 --no-deps\r\npython -m pip install opencv-python-headless\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. At that point, deeplabcut imports in pythonw.\r\n5. Everything up until training works. Training produces snapshots (and uses the GPU), but the segmentation error crashes python when the GPU is being released. \r\n6. Evaluate network give the same error and does not produce any output \r\n7. Analyze videos works and uses the GPU, produces the h5 and pickle files, but the crashes with the seg fault.\r\n\r\n## so what?\r\n\r\nIf you're desperate to run training and analysis on your M1, this can get you started, but you have to work around the crashes, and will need functioning GUI installation of an older DLC to run in a separate env.  Colab is still probably easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/878304431/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5015178363,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMTUxNzgzNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5015178363","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-13T16:58:45Z","label":{"name":"help
