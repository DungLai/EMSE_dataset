@Man677 indeed there is no \"export model\" button in the GUI. \r\n\r\nHere is the docs to do this in the terminal:\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/HelperFunctions.md#new-model-export-function\r\n```python\r\ndeeplabcut.export_model(cfg_path, iteration=None, shuffle=1, trainingsetindex=0, snapshotindex=None, TFGPUinference=True, overwrite=False, make_tar=True)\r\n```\r\nnote, the error message (`FileNotFoundError(\"The config.yaml file at %s does not exist.\" % cfg_path)`) above is correct, you did not put the path to your config.yaml file correctly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr'C:\\Users\\gabri\\Downloads\\Tail\\Tail-FirstModel-2021-02-26\\config'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSHOULD BE:\r\n```python\r\nr'C:\\Users\\gabri\\Downloads\\Tail\\Tail-FirstModel-2021-02-26\\config.yaml'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, please note, 2.2 as a version does not exist yet , ;), so please put the exact version you are using for future issues, and multi-animal projects are not supported for export.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/812546285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4545824950,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDU0NTgyNDk1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4545824950","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-02T14:07:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4545824961,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NTgyNDk2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4545824961","actor":{"login":"GabrielBonassi77","id":79117528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTE3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79117528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBonassi77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-02T14:07:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4545824964,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDU4MjQ5NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4545824964","actor":{"login":"GabrielBonassi77","id":79117528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTE3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79117528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBonassi77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBonassi77/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-02T14:07:46Z","performed_via_g
