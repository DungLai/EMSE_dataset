My best guess here, is the you are using an older conda (anaconda maybe?) installation that was still configured to use Rosetta in order to emulate os64. You can check this with from your base environment with ```python -c \"import platform;print(platform.machine())\"```. If it doesn't print arm64 you are using the old version. If that's the case, the problem is then that conda is looking for ```tensorflow-deps``` in the apple channel. But as you can see [here](https://anaconda.org/apple/tensorflow-deps) that package only exists for arm64 and therefore you get the message \"package not found\". So you have two choices: uninstall your current (ana)conda and install a newer version designed for M1 (arm64). Or leave your current conda in place and install a parallel version. In the latter case, you might run into trouble with where conda is looking for your environments, so it's less clean.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1321816283/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"guiwitz","id":4622767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjI3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4622767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz","html_url":"https://github.com/guiwitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7855885795,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5W1AHzzwAAAAHUP03j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7855885795","actor":{"login":"bendichter","id":844306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/844306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter","html_url":"https://github.com/bendichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-21T10:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7855885802,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5W1AHzzwAAAAHUP03q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7855885802","actor":{"login":"bendichter","id":844306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/844306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter","html_url":"https://github.com/bendichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-21T10:14:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1322212794","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2056#issuecomment-1322212794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2056","id":1322212794,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5Oz126","user":{"login":"bendichter","id":844306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/844306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter","html_url":"https://github.com/bendichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bendichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T15:12:48Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T15:12:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"indeed:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$
