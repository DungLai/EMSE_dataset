I just figured out how to fix mine, so I figured I'd explain it here in case it helps you. Please excuse me if I'm sharing extra information you already know. \r\n\r\nI was trying to start training my model again after having trained for some 25,000 iterations, but was getting the same exact error:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: The passed save_path is not a valid checkpoint: /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt`\r\n\r\nIn trying to figure out what was happening, I found that a little bit before [this](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#g-train-the-network) spot in a DeepLabCut documentation page, there is something labeled Box 2. In it is a description of the \"parameters of interest in the network configuration file, `pose_cfg.yaml`\". My issue was that the `init_weights` variable was set to `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt`, meaning that the function was trying to use the initial weights provided by ResNet despite me having a snapshot of my 25,000 iteration training session stored in my project's folder.\r\n\r\nTo fix my issue, I went to that `pose_cfg.yaml` file, which is in the project folder's `dlc-models` folder a little ways down the file tree. In that spot, I changed the line starting with `init_weights` (which points to the original weights) to point to the same folder (for me, `/content/drive/<my_project>/dlc-models/iteration-0/<folder>/train/snapshot-#`). This solved my issue and my model started training again with the same loss and learning rate as it had at 25K iterations! The only issue is that it appears to have started over at 0 iterations, count-wise.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this matches your situation, and I'm also not 100% sure this is the proper way to fix my issue. That being said hopefully this helps you resolve your problem!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/708778493/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alex-claman","id":67563523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTYzNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67563523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-claman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-claman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/712244226","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/956#issuecomment-712244226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/956","id":712244226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjI0NDIyNg==","user":{"login":"Charlottewiltshire97","id":68918736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTE4NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68918736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97","html_url":"https://github.com/Charlottewiltshire97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Charlottewiltshire97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-19T15:26:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T15:26:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help! Regarding your error, don't worry about it counting from 0, it is training from your 25k iterations, it just begins the count at zero! \r\n\r\nI managed to solve this issue by deleting all the files in the training dataset folder, re-running \"create training dataset\" and then trained no problem. I did originally create the training dataset on colab, and was trying to train on colab. Maybe something bugged when running the code?
