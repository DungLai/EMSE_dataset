So, maybe I can make this more clear in the tracklets GUI, ie maybe low conf points can be toggled on and off, I think this could be helpful for people to get a better intuition of the tracking anyhow. If you have feed back for us on this, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso cc @jeylau\r\n\r\nRight now you could also create a video of all detections before even converting to tracklets, to be sure the pose estimation quality is high - a crucial step :).
