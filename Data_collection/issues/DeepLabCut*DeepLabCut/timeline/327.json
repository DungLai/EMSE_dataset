had the same issue. I trained in CPU mode initially (Deeplabcut version > 2.0.7.0, Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA 10.0, tensorflow 1.14) and it ran out of the box.\r\n\r\nLater I set up my CUDA environment and everything (Excellent docs for that BTW on GitHub and thank you for that !!) and tried training on GPU by using **gputouse = 0** but got memory error (realized I had a 2GB GPU and authors recommend minimum 8GB?). So I tried switching back to CPU with **gputouse = none** but it kept using GPU!!??!!\r\n\r\nWhat @vigji  suggested here is what solved it for me eventually. Spent like 3 hours figuring why is it still using GPU (even printed the if condition that checks if GPU=None, and it used to pass, still the training would start in GPU and give memory errors).\r\n\r\nBut thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/517632592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shaanchandra","id":30862944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYyOTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30862944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/shaanchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaanchandra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2529105747,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUyOTEwNTc0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2529105747","actor":{"login":"vigji","id":10400212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAwMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10400212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji","html_url":"https://github.com/vigji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T09:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2529105748,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MjkxMDU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2529105748","actor":{"login":"vigji","id":10400212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDAwMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10400212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji","html_url":"https://github.com/vigji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigji/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T09:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
