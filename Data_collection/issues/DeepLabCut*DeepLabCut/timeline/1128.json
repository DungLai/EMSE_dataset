Interestingly, it seems as though the triangulation was successful. I only did a preliminary labelling of about 20 frames each so the flicker is expected. I'll probably need to do far more labelling to get an improved scorer, however does it seem that the undistortion is correct? Is there any metric that I can use to verify?\r\n\r\nThank

currently working on a 3DLC Project and I am trying to use the New Advanced Labeling Across Cameras functions, however I am having some trouble. \r\n\r\nI created a 3D Project and calibrated my 2 cameras, although once I check the undistortion, I get black images in return in the undistortion file. Please find attached the checkerboard_3d, original_image and undistorted_points. \r\n1) Original_Image: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jy3848dutqewnh0/Original_Image.png?dl=0\r\n2) Undistorted_points: https://www.dropbox.com/s/csq9bpancd2yr90/undistorted_points.png?dl=0\r\n3) Checkerboard_3d: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zq9vw8wx6v79uve/checkerboard_3d.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nI would like to inform you that my setup is orthogonal, and based on the issue #1128, this may be the reason why I am getting black pictures in result. I still have not tried the triangulation part to see if it works, though. Instead, I wanted to try the new Advanced Labeling Across Cameras functions. \r\n\r\nI succeeded in extracting the frames from the videos of camera-7, however once I try the function dlc.extract_frames(config_path_camera-8, mode='match', config3d=config_path3d, extracted_cam=0), I do not get any of the matched frames in return. \r\nI checked the config file paths many times but I can not detected any issue there. Also, the camera names are correct in the config files. \r\n\r\nHere are 2 screenshots of the code in the terminal : \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82345816/116695549-102b7d80-a9c1-11eb-954b-aac989d0f601.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82345816/116695608-23d6e400-a9c1-11eb-88d5-b7d40b060987.png)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like extra documentation and thank you in advance! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nEviana\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
