@AlexEMG Thanks for the prompt response. My case is different from #463 and #468. In my case, I perform some preprocessing such as affine transformations on my data and generate the .csv and .h5 files with my own scripts. Apparently, few of my annotations are having negative coordinates due to those transformations. When the random crop function is executed on those negative coordinates, the image become an empty numpy array, raising this cv2.resize error. Initially, I changed this behaviour by editing the next_batch() function in pose_defaultdataset.py to skip such examples when training a model. But since the real cause of the error is in dataset creation step, I later changed trainingsetmanipulation.py to not to add such examples to the dataset. I will raise a PR, shortly.
