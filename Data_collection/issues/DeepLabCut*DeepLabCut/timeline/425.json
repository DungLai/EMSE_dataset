Please check the docstrings. \r\n```\r\ndeeplabcut.extract_frames?\r\n\r\nSignature: deeplabcut.extract_frames(config, mode='automatic', algo='kmeans', cr\r\nop=False, userfeedback=True, cluster_step=1, cluster_resizewidth=30, cluster_col\r\nor=False, opencv=True, slider_width=25)\r\nDocstring:\r\nExtracts frames from the videos in the config.yaml file. Only the videos in the \r\nconfig.yaml will be used to select the frames.\r\n\r\nUse the function ``add_new_video`` at any stage of the project to add new videos\r\n to the config file and extract their frames.\r\n\r\nThe provided function either selects frames from the videos in a randomly and temporally uniformly distributed way (uniform), \r\n\r\nby clustering based on visual appearance (k-means), or by manual selection. \r\n\r\nThree important parameters for automatic extraction: numframes2pick, start and stop are set in the config file. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the user guide for more details on methods and parameters https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/11/24/476531.full.pdf\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/535072774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2662104866,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY2MjEwNDg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2662104866","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-25T15:17:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
