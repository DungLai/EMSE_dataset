Maybe that's much less of an issue on Linux, but for Windows users, `conda` makes life much easier compared to `pip`, IMHO.\r\n\r\n> you can pick which TF you want.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can leave out `tensorflow[-gpu]` from the conda file, and you'll have the same flexibility. For unexperienced users, I'd prefer convention over configuration, though, and aim to provide them with a known-good environment definition.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/438684752/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imagejan","id":2033938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzM5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2033938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan","html_url":"https://github.com/imagejan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/438686433","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/20#issuecomment-438686433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/20","id":438686433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODY4NjQzMw==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T14:46:20Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T14:48:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Point taken, we will discuss it today.
