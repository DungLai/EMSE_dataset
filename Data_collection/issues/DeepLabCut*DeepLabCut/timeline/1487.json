In that case, your training is running on your CPU, not your GPU, and it could take a while to run 1000 iterations  (your `display_iters`) before showing anything.\r\n\r\nTo fix, I suggest the following:\r\n1. As per the full [installation instructions](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md),  under **GPU support**, activate your env, and run `conda install -c conda-forge cudnn`. That should fix the initial problem (that message should show something like `cudart64_11.dll`).\r\n2. Start your training again, but change `display_iters` to something like 1 or 10.  That way you'll get faster feedback to ensure that training is actually happening, and the code isn't stuck before it starts running iterations.\r\n3. To see if your GPU is really being used, the best way on windows is to look at the GPU memory on the \"Performance\" tab of Windows task manager (see discussion [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1485#issuecomment-909174928)). You have only 8GB of GPU memory, and a training session should probably take most of that (depending on image size, batch size, etc). GPU memory gets allocated when training starts, and stays high during training. You can also look at the CUDA performance there, which for me oscillates up and down during training.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/909504814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/909529389","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1487#issuecomment-909529389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1487","id":909529389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c42NlEt","user":{"login":"bgibWh","id":89856024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODU2MDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89856024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh","html_url":"https://github.com/bgibWh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgibWh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-31T19:14:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T19:14:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
