It actually seems to cause an error when loading the config file.\r\nIt seems that it passes some other DataFrame to `gurantee_multiindex_rows` before anything is done.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I may have finally discovered the issue. When your initial frame is extracted, there is no H5 file created. So we go to line 397, this creates the first index for our first frame and writes it to the H5 file, however, it is not converted to a tuple yet. When frame 2 is extracted, we enter the main if statement, it loads the h5 file, and then converts everything in it to a tuple (e.g. only frame one) and then concats the other frames we have extracted and saves them to the h5 file with string paths. \r\n\r\nI have added the following line and it seems to be working now! It will convert all new paths to tuples before they are written to the H5 file. Refinement works as expected now, I can open the machine file, edit the labels, and save them and it generates the appropriate CollectedData file. Both lines seem to be needed. Trying to run the function with just `gurantee_multiindex_rows` on **DataCombined** runs into the issue where some of the data may be tuples already and some of it isn't and the function will throw an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3708103/161315240-f4820047-9cc2-4091-9863-3cc876bbeed2.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3708103/161317555-b0b15466-4dd6-42b5-83df-278e72515683.png)\r\n\r\nInstead of using a conversion function for new paths, why are new paths not written as tuples by default? Using the conversion is necessary for backward compatibility with old files, but new paths can just be saved as tuples going forward.
