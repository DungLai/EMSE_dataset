Since I stalled on 2.2.0.3 windows, I switched to Linux. I am using ubuntu, and training with dlc2.2.3 now. \r\nI use 150 frames from video A for training and I think the model good. I can get the .h5 file of video A after analyze video, but when I analyze video B, I got four .pickle files and two errors.
