You just need your video to get going! \r\nHere are more details and videos to show you how: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/PROJECT_GUI.md\r\n\r\nI would do that first.  \r\n\r\nThen, if you want to put your data into the correct format, just format your data exactly like it is in the openfield project you have been working with, you can do this in excel (i.e. download this and edit it). \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/openfield-Pranav-2018-10-30/labeled-data/m4s1/CollectedData_Pranav.csv\r\n\r\nThen, create a new project with the **exact** same bodypart names, and **experimenter** name (scorer name in the excel!), place your excel file inside labeled-data, then you can convert the csv file into h5 using: ``deeplabcut.convertcsv2h5``\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/547591545/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2753513466,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1MzUxMzQ2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2753513466","actor":{"login":"monajalal","id":1892917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTI5MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1892917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal","html_url":"https://github.com/monajalal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T19:29:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2753513469,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTM1MTM0Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2753513469","actor":{"login":"monajalal","id":1892917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTI5MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1892917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal","html_url":"https://github.com/monajalal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monajalal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T19:29:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2753514720,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NTM1MTQ3MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2753514720","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-29T19:29:58Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/547599017","html_url":"htt

How can I force DLC to only do the training/test on these 400 frames for which I have annotations?\r\n\r\n2. How can I generalize it so that it actually trains on the 400 annotated one and use it to test on the ones that are not annotated?\r\n\r\n(I am mostly for now interested in 1 because I have expert ground truth).\r\n3. Do I have to create a separate AVI video of these 400 ish frames? Otherwise, I wonder how else DLC would know which frame is which. Can we actually give the DLC a folder with images as an input instead of an AVI? my understanding is that for question 1 that I asked, I should create a video that only contains these frames. But I would like to double-check with you and get an expert's opinion on this matter.\r\nPlease note that these annotated frames are picked randomly and not necessarily they are in order. For example, 1.JPEG is not annotated by an expert.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-11-10 21-42-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892917/68557469-e9137180-0403-11ea-949b-9e0eb94cd008.png)\r\n\r\nRight now, I am in the above step.
