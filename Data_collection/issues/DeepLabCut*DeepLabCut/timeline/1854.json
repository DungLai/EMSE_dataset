diagnose what is happening. Getting an empty tracklet file is not a result of corrupted videos, but of very poor tracking (which may come at the root from inaccurate detections).  `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections` would help you determine whether model detections look pretty. Then bear in mind that when using `analyze_videos` with the default `auto_track=True`, DeepLabCut uses settings that were found to work well across projects, but yours may be different.\r\nWhen you

Everything's running exactly as it should be now.  Thank you **so** much 😃 \r\nI feel like the `topktoretain: 1` change in the inference_cfg.yaml file should be emphasized in the docs

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\n- The video isn't corrupt.  I checked that running the `from deeplabcut.utils.auxfun_videos import VideoReader` function already.\r\n- When I run `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections()` I get a video with good detections, albeit there is still room for improvement.\r\n- This is iteration #98500.  At #50000 the labeled video was showing pretty decent labeling with a `pcutoff = 0.4`.  But now I'm not even seeing anything of the mouse labeled.  The only points are the ones of the rod.  Screenshot attached.\r\n- The evaluation results of the pixel error have improved from `snapshot-50000`.  So why aren't the labels showing up in the video?  eval csv also attached.\n\n### Operating System\n\nGoogle Colab\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGoogle Colab Pro GPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n**Snapshot 20000 Labeled**\r\n![snapshot-20000 - labeled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101142209/173288559-b077d970-6b00-4093-918e-c967fd571640.png)\r\n**Snapshot 98500 All Detections**\r\n![snapshot-98500 - all detections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101142209/173288565-ecbc8079-34ca-44f1-9401-832bd640edce.png)\r\n**Snapshot 98500 Labeled**\r\n![snapshot-98500 - labeled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101142209/173288568-909f7a3d-2ca0-43bf-9fe3-40506df967f3.png)\r\n[DLC_resnet50_Trial9May23shuffle1_50000-results.csv](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/8888237/DLC_resnet50_Trial9May23shuffle1_50000-results.csv)\r\n[DLC_resnet50_Trial9May23shuffle1_98500-results.csv](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/8888238/DLC_resnet50_Trial9May23shuffle1_98500-results.csv)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1878/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
