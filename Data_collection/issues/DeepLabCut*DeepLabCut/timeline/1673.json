From the image path I can tell that you're on windows, whereas the project path points to a Unix machine. This manual operation is typically not required (unless something wrong happens when parsing the config) as DeepLabCut automatically updates that field to match the current OS/project folder location.\r\nAs a side note, \"creating a training dataset on a different computer where the training will be performed was obviously a mistake\" isn't true anymore, as paths to data or images are now independent of your work station OS. I hope that helps! ☺️

am sorry to reopen this issue.

However, the path seems to be missing: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1161\" alt=\"Captura de pantalla 2022-02-22 a les 10 06 12\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78961609/155099070-cadbf96c-f1d6-4fbf-9615-0b1aba584c3a.png\">\r\n\r\nI think that is happening because refined labels are not correctly saved, somehow. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to fix this, but I am willing to do so because we don't want to lose all labeled frames and start once again. \r\n\r\nAny help or tip is welcome and appreciated. THANK YOU\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1047576418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anna-teruel","id":78961609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTYxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78961609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel","html_url":"https://github.com/anna-teruel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anna-teruel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1047596278","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1673#issuecomment-1047596278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1673","id":1047596278,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c4-cQz2","user":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-22T09:31:50Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T09:31:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No worries, you are not going to lose your annotated data 🙂\r\nIndeed, the paths are now stored without path separators (in 3 separate columns), so the file you show is written properly (you're right though, it's ultimately the h5 file rather than the csv that matters).

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nHi, \r\nI am currently using DLC networks I created a year ago (probably with DLC 2.1.1) to analyze some videos I already analyzed, refined merge to training dataset before. Scorer name and all the folder path are still the same, I only recently updated DLC to 2.2.1. \r\n\r\nAs usual, after the video analysis step, I extracted some outlier frames and tried to correct them, however when I click on \"save\" after refining a video, I get the following errors: `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'tuple'`then `ValueError: On level 0, code max (3) >= length of level (1). NOTE: this index is in an inconsistent state`. \r\n\r\nAlso, relaunching the refinement GUI and trying to correct the label a second time makes DLC crashes.\r\n\r\nI currently have the same issue on 2 other networks I created at the same period and I'm unable to create new training dataset similar to this issue https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1673, however, updating DLC to the 2.2.1 didn't fix it for me.\r\n\r\nIf you could help me understand what's going on, that would be great ! \r\nThanks \n\n### Operating System\n\nubuntu 20.04\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nDLC 2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nload a network created with an old DLC version (?)\r\nAnalyze an old set of videos that was previously analyzed and refined \r\nSuccessfully Extract Outlier Frames\r\nLaunch the Outlier Labeling GUI using LAUNCH GUI\r\nSelect the machinelabels-iter0.h5 file in the appropriate labeled-data folder \r\nCorrect labels\r\nsave\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nIn [8]: deeplabcut.refine_labels(config_path)\r\nGtk-Message: 16:39:34.456: Failed to load module \"canberra-gtk-module\"\r\nChecking labels if they are outside the image\r\n/home/mgraupe/anaconda3/envs/DLC22stable/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/gui/refinement.py:736: FutureWarning: inplace is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\r\n  [self.scorer.replace(self.scorer, self.humanscorer)], level=0, inplace=True\r\nA training dataset file is already found for this video.
