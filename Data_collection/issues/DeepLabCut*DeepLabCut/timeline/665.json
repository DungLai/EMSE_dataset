The fix is to upgrade the Xcode toolkit as follows.\r\nOpen Terminal, and run xcode-select --install, followed by xcode-select --reset. Restart Terminal for changes to take effect. If the error persists, enter the command sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools. Terminal will ask for your password; note that the password is not shown as you
