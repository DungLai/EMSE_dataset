Firstly, we ask all questions be posted on the forum: https://forum.image.sc/tags/deeplabcut \r\n\r\nPlease see community guidelines here: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut#community-support-developers--help\r\n\r\nIn short, if you are simply trying to scale your analysis I suggest you use bash scripts + cronjobs on the server. \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to do closed-loop or really need real time from a camera stream, we don't recommend that function, but rather grabbing a live video stream from analyze_videos; we have a function to export trained models for this now (see 2.1.7 release statement). But, our real-time module will be fully out in the next months.
