In your case, the the mother is the unique, and the children are the multianimal bodyparts. This is like the parenting mouse example in the paper.\r\n\r\nDatasets for maDLC **will** be released when the paper is published, so stay tuned!\r\n\r\n\r\nMore tips from this page: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/convert_maDLC.md \r\n\r\nExample: Imagine you had a project with the moon and a rocket with two parts labeled:\r\n`bodyparts: [moon, rocket_tip,rocket_bottom]`\r\n\r\nNow you want to use this former project (labeled-data) and work on a new dataset (videos) with one moon but multiple (3) rockets. Then convert it as follows:\r\n```\r\nindividuals: [rocket1, rocket2, rocket3]\r\nuniquebodyparts: [moon]\r\nmultianimalbodyparts: [rocket_tip,rocket_bottom]\r\nskeleton: [[[rocket_tip,rocket_bottom]]]\r\n```\r\nIn the unusual case, that your data also has multiple moons (e.g. is now carried out around Jupiter), but one rocket:\r\n```\r\nindividuals: [Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto]\r\nuniquebodyparts: [rocket_tip,rocket_bottom]\r\nmultianimalbodyparts: [moon]\r\n```\r\nNote you can use the single object tracker for this situation. What if you have multiple moons and rockets?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/879153938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5014416283,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTAxNDQxNjI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5014416283","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-13T14:48:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5014416308,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTAxNDQxNjMwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5014416308","actor":{"login":"arjunt19","id":44276017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjc2MDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44276017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19","html_url":"https://github.com/arjunt19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-13T14:48:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5014416315,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUwMTQ0MTYzMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5014416315","actor":{"login":"arjunt19","id":44276017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjc2MDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44276017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19","html_url":"https://github.com/arjunt19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjunt19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-13T14:48:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5014417295,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMTQ0MTcyOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5014417295","actor":{"login":"MMathi
