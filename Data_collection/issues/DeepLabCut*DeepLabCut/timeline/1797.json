For maDLC you should not label body parts per animal, i.e. leftear_mice2 It should be left ear... the idea is that if you have shared body parts-- named the same, same location-- across animals, it should be just leftear\n\nUnfortunately, the way you have it setup won't work for maDLC efficiently.\n\nPlease see these docs:\n\nhttps://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html#configure-the-project\n\n—\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because
