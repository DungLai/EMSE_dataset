See all the demo's here! Please note that GUIs are not easily supported in Jupyter in MacOS, as you need a framework build of python. While it's possible to launch them with a few tweaks, we recommend using the Project Manager GUI or terminal, so please follow the instructions below.\r\n\r\nBut it is working for me on Windows: see this file here (which is different that what you posted above as the latest DLC-CPU env:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nname: DLC-CPU\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - python=3.7\r\n  - pip\r\n  - jupyter\r\n  - nb_conda\r\n  - tensorflow==1.13.1\r\n  - wxpython<4.1.0\r\n  - pip:\r\n    - deeplabcut\r\n```\r\n\r\nps - to add, 2.1.9 does not exist yet ;) but you could try [deeplabcutcore](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-core) -> ``pip install deeplabcutcore`` which has no GUI dependencies and would load okay.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we recommend using the terminal or the Project Manager GUI, which was upgrade a lot with 2.2.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/643411098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3439425151,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQzOTQyNTE1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3439425151","actor":{"login":"cd3128","id":64170297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTcwMjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64170297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128","html_url":"https://github.com/cd3128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-12T17:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3439425152,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0Mzk0MjUxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3439425152","actor":{"login":"cd3128","id":64170297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTcwMjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64170297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128","html_url":"https://github.com/cd3128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cd3128/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-12T17:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3441432299,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ0MTQzMjI5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3441432299","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-14T06:27:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
