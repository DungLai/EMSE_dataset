If you select checkcropping=true only the first frame pops up and when closing this from the code stops working. If you select checkcropping=false no cropping at all will occur and the frames are imported as 640x480. This means, with multiple videos you are not able to crop. In addition, why would every movie path have the selection‘ crop’ if in the end you can only crop with the default x1,x2,y1,y2 setting?\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nOn 13 Nov 2018, at 21:24, Alexander Mathis <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why recommend using checkcropping=False for multiple videos.
