(I haven't used OpenCV before, and this seems like a pretty crappy way to handle this, but I'm not the person that wrote OpenCV...).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I would label this \"user error\", but given that we both agree that this is a problem, I won't push it. I'm not really sure who is at fault here - arguably the linux distribution providing OpenCV - which is why we are going to fix it by fixing our packaging script. Also this breaks the test, which is good, because that's what tests are for, but it doesn't give any helpful sort of error and I had to go track down where the problem is originating from. Namely; that the project file is being created incorrectly as you said.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the best way to handle this would be, but indeed I think the problem should be raised where the problem happens - i.e. at project creation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/605493964/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"deliciouslytyped","id":47436522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDM2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47436522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped","html_url":"https://github.com/deliciouslytyped","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/605494051","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/639#issuecomment-605494051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/639","id":605494051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTQ5NDA1MQ==","user":{"login":"deliciouslytyped","id":47436522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDM2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47436522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped","html_url":"https://github.com/deliciouslytyped","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deliciouslytyped/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-28T17:39:05Z","updated_at":"2020-03-28T17:39:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you don't mind me asking a mostly unrelated question here;
