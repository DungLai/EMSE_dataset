On Windows, glob paths sometimes contained a mixture of forward and backward slashes, causing problems when writing the annotated data.\r\nMake sure you `pip install napari-deeplabcut>=0.0.9`.\r\n\r\nA simple way to get your current data file fixed is to open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets, and manually add the 2 missing columns (as in this image https://github.com/DeepLabCut/napari-deeplabcut/issues/30#issue-1301728053): one with `labeled-data` and the other with the corresponding video folder names.\r\nYou can then open that file in pandas and convert it to h5:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = pd.read_csv(path_to_file, header=[0, 1, 2, 3], index_col=[0, 1, 2])\r\ndf.to_hdf(path_to_file.replace('.csv', '.h5'),
