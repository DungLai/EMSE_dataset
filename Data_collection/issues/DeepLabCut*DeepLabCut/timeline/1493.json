What we do internally is when you name the image and subsequent container, you can name it to ID both GPU and pypi version.

I guess I'm just afraid if things upgrade and change underlying code for me. I'm using Concourse CI to create pipelines to train my models with dlc but that will pull latest image then I run it through https://github.com/paninski-lab/deepgraphpose. that code rely on some underlying deeplabcut code.
