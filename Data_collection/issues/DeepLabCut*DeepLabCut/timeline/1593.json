The following is the error I got. I believe the reason that I am getting this error is that `df_cam1_view[scorer_cam1][bp][\"likelihood\"].values[k]` needs to have the index for the individual before indexing the bodyparts, which means it should be `df_cam1_view[scorer_cam1][individual][bp][\"likelihood\"].values[k]`.

I have a quick question to ask and I will really appreciate it if you can take 1 minute to help.\n\nIn your recent paper \"Multi-animal pose estimation and tracking with DeepLabCut\", in Figure 1a, you show a case where you have 2 different animals(mouse and pups) and each animal has a different number of body parts. I am wondering if you trained 2 separate networks(1 for each kind of animal) or just 1 network for all the animals. If you used only 1 network, how did you define the config file so that each animal could have a different number of body parts?\n\nThank you in advance.\nBest regards,\nLuke\n\n\nXueyang Yao\nPhD
