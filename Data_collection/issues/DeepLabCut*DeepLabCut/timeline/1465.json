Now your research can truly start!\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid you see a progress bar as it analyzed each video? 30k frames should take a couple of minutes to analyze. If not, then it never loaded the full video. The fact that it finds the frame numbers for each suggests that your paths are all correct, and that it can see the files themselves. But it might not be able to actually load the frames. That could still be a drive/colab issue, or your video files could be corrupted.\r\n\r\nYou can easily check the videos with\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeeplabcut.check_video_integrity(video_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`video_path` is the path to a single video, not a list of all videos or a path to a directory.  E.g., you could try adding a colab cell with the following in your notebook:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvideo_path = \"/content/drive/Shareddrives/DeepLabCut_SRM_SharedDrive/ProjectFolders/Vanessa_Project_Folders/IKKBetaCA-Pilocarpine-OF_21vids_Atmpt3-VU-2021-07-26/videos/Trial61.mp4\"\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.check_video_integrity(video_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your video is fine, the cell will run \"for a while\" (it will load the video frame by frame) without any feedback, then stop running. If it gives no warnings and stops itself, your video is probably ok. If it gives warnings, then you should re-encode the video.\r\n\r\nThat said, given that @rhgoo is having an apparently similar problem but with a different stage suggests some colab issue (but many aren't having any problems, and I just ran a test without a problem, so it's not a universal deeplabcut or colab issue).\r\n\r\nYou could also try one video at a time, giving the full path to the video in square brackets, rather than a directory of videos. \r\n\r\nLastly, make sure you're passing `videotype` correctly. It should be \"mp4\" or \"avi\" without a \".\". That can cause some unpredictable behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/903104170/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5189735785,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE4OTczNTc4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5189735785","actor":{"login":"PatrickHonma","id":85576484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85576484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickHonma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-21T11:44:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5189735787,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxODk3MzU3ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5189735787","actor":{"login":"PatrickHonma","id":85576484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85576484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickHonma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-21T11:44:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5189735791,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE4OTczNTc5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5189735791","actor":{"login":"rhgoo","id":86977704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTc3NzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86977704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo","html_url":"https://github.com/rhgoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-21T11:44:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5189735793,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxODk3MzU3OTM=","url":"https://api.git

But since you don't see the progress bar during analysis, though, indicates that deeplabcut in colab isn't loading the actual video. Did you run the integrity check in colab or on your local computer? I think the only way to troubleshoot this that I can think of is to run the integrity check on colab, and to run the video analysis on your local computer (which will be slow without a GPU, so choose the shortest possible video that fails on colab). There is also a [memory leak](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1468) in opencv, which seems to manifest differently in the issue report linked, but could be related to this since your videos are fairly long.\r\n\r\n@rhgoo - that seems to be a problem with colab reading and writing files.

locally.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/909514156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5234535365,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIzNDUzNTM2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5234535365","actor":{"login":"PatrickHonma","id":85576484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85576484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickHonma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T18:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5234535371,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMzQ1MzUzNzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5234535371","actor":{"login":"PatrickHonma","id":85576484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTc2NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85576484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickHonma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickHonma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T18:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5234535375,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIzNDUzNTM3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5234535375","actor":{"login":"rhgoo","id":86977704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTc3NzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86977704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo","html_url":"https://github.com/rhgoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-31T18:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5234535378,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMzQ1MzUzNzg=","url":"https://
