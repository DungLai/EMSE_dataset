and fps are not important because the training is not occurring on the videos; training is only using the labeled images. Batch size (in the pose_cfg.yaml file) describes how many images it is trying to train on at once. Your videos are very high resolution, so your training images are high resolution. If it is training on several high resolution images, it will run out memory.\r\n\r\nIf you don't need all of that resolution to track your points of interest, you should consider downsampling your videos.\r\n\r\nSince you are running maDLC, you should run croptrainingimagesandlabels before training, which will crop down the size of your training images to whatever resolution you set (400x400 by default, I use 600x600 for one of my projects), and will really speed up training (be sure to check the labels after cropping to make sure the cropped size is roughly the size or a bit larger than of one of your animals).\r\n\r\nThen decrease batch size. Try it with batch size of 1 with cropped images. If that works, then increase batch size to 2, then 4, etc, until it fails. Then reduce it again. You will get a better model and faster training with higher batch sizes.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no easy way to calculate what your batch size should be because things other than image size take up GPU memory during training, so you have to use trial and error to find the highest batch size the GPU can handle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/811080862/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/811085821","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1173#issuecomment-811085821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1173","id":811085821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTA4NTgyMQ==","user":{"login":"DorianBattivelli","id":66886884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66886884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianBattivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T13:52:29Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T13:53:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for this exhaustive and clear answer. \r\nOne doubt: with the croptrainingimagesandlabels command, cropping means reducing the field of the frame right?
