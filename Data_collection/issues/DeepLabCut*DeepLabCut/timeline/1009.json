Now I have some new ideas about what I can do. The information of my system is as the following: \r\n**OS: Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\nDeepLabCut Version: 2.1.8.2\r\nAnaconda env used: GPU**\r\n    About the iterations, I noticed that in the DLC project documents it mentions that \"CRITICAL POINT: It is recommended to train the ResNets or MobileNets for thousands of iterations until the loss plateaus (typically around 200,000) if you use batch size 1.\" I'm wondering whether running 1M iterations will render my network overfitted. I could try 300,000 iterations or more later. Also, 1M iterations would cost me a lot of time. ðŸ˜” \r\n    I will check the labels,change the pcutoff&train_test_split parameter in the configuration file, and filtered=True for my next training.\r\n    Above all, you are so smart and your guess is correct ðŸ˜‰ I'm an undergraduate student from TK lab. If you have pretrained forelimb network, that will help me a lot! (And obviously, I'm not that familiar with loading pretained network, and would explore further about that.
