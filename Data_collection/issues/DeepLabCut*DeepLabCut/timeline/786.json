We can close this issue now. Here's what I did: \r\n\r\n1. I discovered that the command `nvidia-smi` does not show the version of CUDA that is _installed_ but the version that is compatible with the driver. And `nvcc --version` is more reliable in determining what version of CUDA you have. Ref: [NVIDIA driver CUDA version](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvidia-smi-doesnt-show-cuda-version-even-after-installation/68738)\r\n\r\n2. I uninstalled my nvidia driver, and all CUDA-associated installs using control panel --> uninstall programs. I reinstalled the latest version of nvidia-driver compatible with my nvidia card, which is 451.48.\r\n\r\n3. I then installed the **correct** version of VisualStudio compatible with CUDA 9, which happens to be VS 2017. I'm unsure if this actually makes any difference, nevertheless, it felt good to not get a warning about incompatible VS during CUDA install. Ref: [Installing tensorflow with CUDA and cuDNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-with-cuda-cudnn-and-gpu-support-on-windows-10-60693e46e781)\r\n\r\n4. I downloaded and installed CUDA 9 and all four patches. \r\n\r\n5. This is the tricky bit. It took a lot of fiddling because I was trying to use tensorflow-gpu 1.12 (like in the example you've provided in the manual for GPU setup), but I kept getting an error saying that that version could not be found. I then discovered through [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50622525/which-tensorflow-and-cuda-version-combinations-are-compatible), (also a part of your manual) that tensorflow 1.12 is only compatible with Python versions up to 3.6. The python version in the dependencies in the .yaml file was set to 3.7. So, the **solution was to change the Python dependency to 3.7, and change the tensorflow dependency to 1.12**.  Once I had the .yaml set up, I installed deeplabcut. And then updated to deeplabcut 2.2 through `pip install deeplabcut==2.2b6`.\r\n\r\n6. Then I followed the [ffmpeg setup tutorial](https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/20495/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-ffmpeg-in-windows), also in your manual, and installed ffmpeg. \r\n\r\n7. I then ran the test script, following the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s), and VOILA! it worked!\r\n\r\nQuestion: Does this confirm that my GPU is being used, or does it just mean deeplabcut is able to run?
