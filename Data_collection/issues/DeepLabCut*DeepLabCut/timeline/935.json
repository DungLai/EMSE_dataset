(windows 10, dlc 2.2b8, pandas = 1.1.2)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the labels are sorted alphabetically at some point after labelling and before/during evaluation. You can see this by looking at any of the csv reports in evaluation-data.\r\n\r\nFor example, in my config file, my body parts are\r\n```\r\nuniquebodyparts: []\r\nmultianimalbodyparts:\r\n- ul\r\n- br\r\n- beak\r\n- leftwingtip\r\n- rightwingtip\r\n- lefttail\r\n- righttail\r\n- rump\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut in dist.csv they are listed alphabetically:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeak\r\nbr\r\nlefttail\r\nleftwingtip\r\nrighttail\r\nrightwingtip\r\nrump\r\nul\r\n```\r\nI've checked the colors and they support the pattern. Eg, `ul` is human labeled blue (the first in this color map, its placement in the config), but machine labeled yellow (the last in this color map, its placement in eval results and alphabetically). And `br` which is at the same spot is colored correctly.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to affect tracking stages, or final outputs, so I had been assuming it was cosmetic or my eyes were going bad.  Now I'm wondering if it explains some pesky rmse values during evaluation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/702173809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3832751126,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzODMyNzUxMTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3832751126","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-02T07:39:02Z","assignee":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/702583199","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/935#issuecomment-702583199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/935","id":702583199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjU4MzE5OQ==","user":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T07:52:42Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T07:52:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great catch @backyardbiomech @mfkeles!
