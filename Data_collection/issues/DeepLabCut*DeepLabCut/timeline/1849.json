The recipe was originally meant to describe an additional tool to validate annotated images (so when h5 files only contain 2D coordinates. You're right though that for final model outputs one would need `(len(df), -1, 3)`.\r\nWe could either edit the recipe by adding:\r\n```\r\nbpt1 = df.xs('head', level='bodyparts', axis=1).to_numpy()[..., :2]\r\nbpt2 = df.xs('tail', level='bodyparts', axis=1).to_numpy()[..., :2]\r\n```\r\nor having the following clause:\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n    diff = (bpt1 - bpt2).reshape((len(df), -1, 2))\r\nexcept ValueError:\r\n    diff = (bpt1 - bpt2).reshape((len(df), -1, 3))\r\n\r\nWould you maybe like to submit a pull request?

Make sure now that you open a Pull Request so I can merge them into our code ðŸ˜ƒ\r\nAs for the # of iterations, it's hard to tell as it really is specific to one's dataset (roughly though, I'd maybe say 200k+ for single-animal projects as they are trained with batch size 1, and 60k+ for multi-animal, but again, these are very very rough estimates). You typically want to see the loss converge and stabilize, which indicates that your model isn't learning anymore. A neat thing to do too is to save model weights every 5â€“10k iterations for example, and evaluate your network over all of them to pick the best snapshot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1141442452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"diegosancarmen","id":101142209,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgdOwQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101142209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen","html_url":"https://github.com/diegosancarmen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosancarmen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-30T19:57:30Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T19:57:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1853","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1853/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1853/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1853/events","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/1853","id":1253080596,"node_id":"PR_kwDOB5BM6c44s4Pe","number":1853,"title":"Update
