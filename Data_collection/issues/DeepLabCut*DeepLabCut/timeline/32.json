It then looks for subfolders within the basefolder which contain the the Results.cvs file [See lines 40-49 of Step2].  So it might be that in your case you need to put your images and .csv files into a subfolder of data-'Task'.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, \r\nFederico","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/409834232/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FedeClaudi","id":17436313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDM2MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17436313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi","html_url":"https://github.com/FedeClaudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FedeClaudi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1767820004,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc2NzgyMDAwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1767820004","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-02T14:29:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/410048783","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/32#issuecomment-410048783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/32","id":410048783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDA0ODc4Mw==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-02T19:56:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T19:56:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Alternatively you can change the paths accordingly in Step_2, and so on.
