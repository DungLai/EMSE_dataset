@MMathisLab !\r\n\r\nThanks for that feedback. However, I have a few more questions about that command. First, I tried to use the deeplabcut-docker tool, but it is not working on my system. I can use pip install to install it to a new conda environment, but then all deeplabcut commands are not recognized. I suspect this is because we don't have docker and instead use singularity to manage containers, if that's the right way to say it. So, I'm trying to take the command you provide for deeplabcut-docker for binding directories and adapt it to singularity. \r\n\r\nSo, in the command deeplabcut-docker bash -v /home/mackenzie/DEEPLABCUT:/home/mackenzie/DEEPLABCUT, I'm thinking these are paths that should be adapted to my system. Is that correct? Or is /home/mackenzie/DEEPLABCUT a directory within the container, so I need to bind my local directory to it, via something like localDir:/home/mackenzie/DEEPLABCUT? I'd appreciate any information you can provide. Thanks!\r\n\r\n~Nick","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1125331396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nmtimme","id":38138179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38138179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme","html_url":"https://github.com/nmtimme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6600781138,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5JgvE2zwAAAAGJb-1S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6600781138","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T19:07:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6600781146,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5JgvE2zwAAAAGJb-1a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6600781146","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T19:07:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1129111021","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1828#issuecomment-1129111021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1828","id":1129111021,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5DTN3t","user":{"login":"nmtimme","id":38138179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38138179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme","html_url":"https://github.com/nmtimme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T17:05:47Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T17:05:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@MMathisLab , I'm wondering if you or anyone else has made progress on this issue.

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nFollowing up on issue #1828 , is there a way to control where the pretrained network is saved during training data set creation? I have been unable to resolve that issue (#1828) using the solution suggested. My main writable directory on the cluster is bound and the container version of the software can created directories in analysis steps before creation of the training data set. Perhaps the directory structures on a cluster were (understandably) not anticipated when designing the container?
