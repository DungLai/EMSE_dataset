Putting aside the question of whether or not overtraining occurs for maDLC models when trained beyond 200,000 iterations, how do I change this 200,000 training limit? In `deeplabcut.train_network` I tried setting `maxiters=300000` but it was still overwritten back to 200,000. To be more specific to my exact situation, I've successfully trained my maDLC model for 200,000 iterations but now I want to re-train it on the same training set for 100,000 more iterations. In the train>pose_cfg.yaml file, I changed `init_weights` to point to my last snapshot (snapshot-200000). However, my re-training job seems to not want to run because that 200,000 iteration threshold was reached in my first training session. Is there a way to overcome this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1068510577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jacob-amme","id":75270798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjcwNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75270798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme","html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-amme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6246705161,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0VSgJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6246705161","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:59:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6246705163,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0VSgL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6246705163","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:59:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6246705169,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0VSgR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6246705169","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:59:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6246705173,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0VSgV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6246705173","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"

In the train>pose_cfg.yaml file I changed the last line of `multi_step` from `200000` (the default) to `300000`.

This variable is set in pose_config.yaml. However, you can overwrite it with this. If None, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten!

this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1069395598/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jacob-amme","id":75270798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjcwNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75270798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme","html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-amme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-amme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6252914514,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0s-dS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6252914514","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T17:50:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6252914521,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c4sruVKzwAAAAF0s-dZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6252914521","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-16T17:50:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-21T05:18:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T05:18:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.

However, at the end it still shows that \"The network is now trained and ready to evaluate.\" How can I fix it?\r\n(By the way the loss is just 0.0010, or is this the reason why it stops automatically?) \n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux Ubuntu\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.1.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu Nvidia 3060\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1.Click training data sets and wait for several hours.\r\nwhen it runs to Iteration 200000, it automatically stopped.\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\niteration: 198000 loss: 0.0010 scmap loss: 0.0009 locref loss: 0.0000 limb loss: 0.0001 lr: 1e-05\r\niteration: 199000 loss: 0.0010 scmap loss: 0.0009 locref loss: 0.0000 limb loss: 0.0001 lr: 1e-05\r\niteration: 200000 loss: 0.0010 scmap loss: 0.0009 locref loss: 0.0000 limb loss: 0.0001 lr: 1e-05\r\n2022-07-20 23:22:20.459561: W tensorflow/core/kernels/queue_base.cc:277] _0_fifo_queue: Skipping cancelled enqueue attempt with queue not closed\r\nException in thread Thread-1:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1377, in _do_call\r\n    return fn(*args)\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1360, in _run_fn\r\n    return self._call_tf_sessionrun(options, feed_dict, fetch_list,\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1453, in _call_tf_sessionrun\r\n    return tf_session.TF_SessionRun_wrapper(self._session, options, feed_dict,\r\ntensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.CancelledError: Enqueue operation was cancelled\r\n\t [[{{node fifo_queue_enqueue}}]]\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/threading.py\", line 932, in _bootstrap_inner\r\n    self.run()\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/threading.py\", line 870, in run\r\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/core/train.py\", line 83, in load_and_enqueue\r\n    sess.run(enqueue_op, feed_dict=food)\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 967, in run\r\n    result = self._run(None, fetches, feed_dict, options_ptr,\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1190, in _run\r\n    results = self._do_run(handle, final_targets, final_fetches,\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1370, in _do_run\r\n    return self._do_call(_run_fn, feeds, fetches, targets, options,\r\n  File \"/home/n513n514/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py\", line 1396, in _do_call\r\n    raise type(e)(node_def, op, message)  #
