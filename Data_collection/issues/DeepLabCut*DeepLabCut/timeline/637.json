thanks, I added that package (binaries should already be there as nix packages intel-openmy with the binary MKL package) just in case, no difference.\r\n\r\nI used `pudb` to track down the hang all the way until [_k_init](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a84ba0c0b8b4948a5571ce1a815102c43d35cdd1/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py#L120). This calls [euclidean_distances](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a84ba0c0b8b4948a5571ce1a815102c43d35cdd1/sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py#L303), where the code calls [safe_sparse_dot](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1495f69242646d239d89a5713982946b8ffcf9d9/sklearn/utils/extmath.py#L142). The hang occurs in the `np.dot` call, and I couldn't trace further with a python debugger. I did save the two arrays being sent to `np.dot` (`a.shape == (3, 810)`, `b.shape ==(810, 256)`). but I could not reproduce the hang in a python shell. Therefore, we appear to have hit some ugly calling context-dependency in the compiled numpy code, which is a major bummer.\r\n\r\nI'm on sklearn 0.21.3, and I noticed that `safe_sparse_dot` changes dramatically. Now, rather than calling `np.dot`, the code calls `a @ b` unless ndim > 2. Thus, perhaps we hit a known bug that might be fixed on upgrading sklearn. \r\n\r\nIn fact, this appears to be the same issue as described back in 2012: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/636#issuecomment-4172159\r\n\r\nEdit: worth noting that Iâ€™m on Linux using MKL. Explanation appears to be https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/636#issuecomment-134504345 and may be related to Python Multiprocessing violating POSIX standard. In any case, this does not appear to be a deeplabcut problem\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I was able to fix the hang by changing some dependencies! It appears that the issue only occurs if `numpy` is compiled against `openblas`, and does not occur if `numpy` is compiled against `mkl`. I am working to validate this
