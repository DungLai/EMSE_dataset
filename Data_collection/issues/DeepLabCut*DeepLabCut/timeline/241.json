The rest I would rather keep.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat files are still necessary when running inference?\r\nA snapshot (+ the file structure)\r\n\r\nNamely, would I still need the training videos?\r\nNo. The videos are not important (neither are the training data themselves, but I would keep those around)\r\n\r\nDo I need all checkpoints to be present or only the one being used?\r\n\r\nNo, you can keep any single one (or the last one etc.). Just make sure you keep all 3 files (i.e. snapshot-somenumber.index, snapshot-somenumber.meta, snapshot-somenumber.data-00000-of-00001)\r\n\r\nWhy is there no error message being issued?\r\n\r\nThere would be an error message, when there is an error.... \"The videos are analyzed. Now your research can truly start!\" suggests that: either the videos were already analyzed or they are not found (thus they were already analyzed). Perhaps check that you give the correct path?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/472146840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2198455595,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxOTg0NTU1OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2198455595","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-12T20:52:48Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2200251517,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwMDI1MTUxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2200251517","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-13T13:32:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/472572277","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/241#issuecomment-472572277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/241","id":472572277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjU3MjI3Nw==","user":{"login":"etterguillaume","id":35970969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTcwOTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35970969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume","html_url":"https://github.com/etterguillaume","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etterguillaume/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T19:31:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T19:31:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Vide
