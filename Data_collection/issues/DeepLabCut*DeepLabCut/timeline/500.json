I've read that the error may be due to other MKL-related DLLs being missing. This thread explains it more clearly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57567892/intel-mkl-fatal-error-cannot-load-mkl-intel-thread-dll. If this is the case, the problem may have to do with Windows 10 updates or Python 3.7 implementations (which I have also read may cause some conflicts with MKL). This is by no means a definitive answer. I've just read some on the same problem since last week.
