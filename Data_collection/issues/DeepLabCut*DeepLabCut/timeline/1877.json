For example, when performing KMeans during `extract_outlier_frames()`, when there are typically far fewer frames that need clustering (say, 1000 vs. the 216,000 frames in a 60FPS 1h video), KMeans completes without error. \r\n\r\nWe have still not successfully built a 2.2.1 Docker image, but were were able to get a mostly functional conda installation w/ GPU support and a GUI (just used for manual frame selection and labeling) using the following environment:\r\n```\r\nchannels:\r\n  - conda-forge\r\n  - defaults\r\ndependencies:\r\n  - python=3.8\r\n  - pip\r\n  - jupyter\r\n  - nb_conda\r\n  - ffmpeg\r\n  - scipy\r\n  - scikit-learn\r\n  - tensorflow-gpu\r\n  - wxpython\r\n  - pip:\r\n    - \"deeplabcut\"\r\n```\r\nThese [GPU-enabled tensorflow builds](https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2021-11-03-tensorflow-gpu/) make life very easy. Might be worth pointing to them in the install documentation.
