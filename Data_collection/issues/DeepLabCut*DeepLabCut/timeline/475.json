So it seems the duration calculation is the same independently of save_frames parameter. I know all of the frames were extracted, thats what it took 2:40:28 hours, but then the video is made to fit in the wrongly calculated duration, wrong because fps is wrong. Can you point me to the lines in the code where duration is used to determine the length of the output video?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/549020091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"auesro","id":24290290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjkwMjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24290290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro","html_url":"https://github.com/auesro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/549067269","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/475#issuecomment-549067269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/475","id":549067269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTA2NzI2OQ==","user":{"login":"auesro","id":24290290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjkwMjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24290290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro","html_url":"https://github.com/auesro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auesro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T18:04:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T18:04:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok,
