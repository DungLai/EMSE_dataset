I've just tried the use case you described, and had no problem extracting outlier frames in Colab and label them locally. Is your machinelabels.csv file empty? If not, could it be that point size is so small that hollow points cannot be seen on the image? You could try with a lower pcutoff threshold (e.g., 0.1) so dots appear filled.\r\nAnyway, you could manually delete the machinelabels h5 and csv files, and call `deeplabcut.dropimagesduetolackofannotation` to drop the images that were not originally annotated: this should leave you in the state just prior to outlier extraction.\r\n(Also note that the presence of a GPU is unlikely to accelerate outlier extraction: it is almost the same procedure as frame extraction, and is mostly I/O operations on individual image files.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1141102226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6702690232,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5KZeDCzwAAAAGPgu-4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6702690232","actor":{"login":"kaylago","id":36450185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDUwMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36450185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago","html_url":"https://github.com/kaylago","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T12:31:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6702690243,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5KZeDCzwAAAAGPgu_D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6702690243","actor":{"login":"kaylago","id":36450185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDUwMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36450185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago","html_url":"https://github.com/kaylago","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaylago/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T12:31:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6702751677,"node_id":"LE_lADOB5BM6c5KZeDCzwAAAAGPg9-9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6702751677","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-30T12:40:24Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1141202754","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1848#issuecomment-1141202754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1848","id":1141202754,"node_id":"IC_kwD
