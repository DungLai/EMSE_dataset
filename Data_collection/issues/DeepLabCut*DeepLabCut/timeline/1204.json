This was indeed introduced in: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/1195\r\n\r\nBut we rolled-back this ResNet_50 naming convention to version to pre-2.1.10*, when this change was introduced: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/v2.1.10\r\n\r\nThis name change was accidentally introduced when adding the EfficientNets in January and caused videos analyzed with ResNets to be reanalyzed as the `DLCsccorername` changed. This is a fix for backwards compatibility, but of course all new projects from January '21 - now suffer the same problem... \r\n\r\nOne can of course write a script to re-name the output files (as you also point out) & or simply re-run DLC.\r\n\r\nWe are really sorry for the inconvenience!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/827029218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4646431241,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ2NDY0MzEyNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4646431241","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T17:48:16Z","label":{"name":"backwards compatibility","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4646432921,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY0NjQzMjkyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4646432921","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T17:48:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
