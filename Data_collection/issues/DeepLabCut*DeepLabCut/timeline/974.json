@mfkeles hope you are well. Note we have a rather fully new version of maDLC out, rc3; the speed is faster and I also want to just correct 1 minor thing above, namely: The assembly is necessary for maDLC if you want to benefit from the PAFs and the graph assembly algo, which is responsible for the performance boost. Also check out DLCRNet, I am getting excellent perf. on single animal maDLC projects. \r\n\r\nLastly I agree for dynamic - it's a good suggestion and still in the works; especially for when maDLC

there @mfkeles :) SO, there is a new function for maDLC where you can pass in analyze_videos `auto_track= true` it will run the whole pipeline (track, stitch, etc). This is super useful in two ways: (1) for beginners there is less to worry about/do; (2) for those that use maDLC with a single animal, now you will get your H5, CSV, etc in 1 click :D 🎉 \r\n\r\nI need to make a few tweaks, but it should be easier now to use dynamic cropping with single animal too (still pass the dynamic cropping). \r\n\r\nWIP i.e.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndeeplabcut.analyze_videos(cfg, [video], videotype='mp4', auto_track=True, n_tracks = 1, dynamic=(True, 0.5, 10))\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/999715954/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5805787577,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c4rjZ-EzwAAAAFaDUm5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5805787577","actor":{"login":"mfkeles","id":22876046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODc2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22876046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles","html_url":"https://github.com/mfkeles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-22T16:41:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5805787582,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c4rjZ-EzwAAAAFaDUm-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5805787582","actor":{"login":"mfkeles","id":22876046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODc2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22876046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles","html_url":"https://github.com/mfkeles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfkeles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-22T16:41:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
