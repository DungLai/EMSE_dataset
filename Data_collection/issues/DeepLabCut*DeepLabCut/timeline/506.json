The goal is that for all (labeled-data) frames, where this new bodypart is visible you should have a label.\n\nHowever there are multiple ways to achieve this:\n- you can make a new project with fewer frames that are completely labeled (you can copy those folders over)\n- you run prediction on all unlabeled frames to predict the missing/novel bodypart and fix it\n- you exclude unlabeled points from training (i.e. the targetmap is zeroed fo the loss)\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Yaraat92 <notifications@github.com>\nSent: Thursday, November 28, 2019 4:59:50 AM\nTo: AlexEMG/DeepLabCut <DeepLabCut@noreply.github.com>\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\nSubject: Re: [AlexEMG/DeepLabCut] Adding new body parts to existing project (#506)\n\n\nDoes this mean I have to add the labels to all the extracted frames from every video I used in the project?
