One suggestion though: since it seems that a white border is expected around the board, you could try to invert the image (this is the relevant post I had found https://stackoverflow.com/a/60625610, maybe that helps). I'm closing the issue for now, but feel free to reopen it if you feel there is anything we can do on DLC's side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/754007784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4165219962,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE2NTIxOTk2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4165219962","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-04T14:30:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4165219975,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE2NTIxOTk3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4165219975","actor":{"login":"maristanye","id":62014527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDE0NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62014527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye","html_url":"https://github.com/maristanye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-04T14:30:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4165219978,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNjUyMTk5Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4165219978","actor":{"login":"maristanye","id":62014527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDE0NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62014527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye","html_url":"https://github.com/maristanye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maristanye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-04T14:30:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
