The index of the trained network is specified by parameters in the config file (in particular t\r\nhe variable 'snapshotindex')\r\n\r\n   You can crop the video (before analysis), by changing 'cropping'=True and setting 'x1','x2','y1','y2' in the config file. The same cropping \r\nparameters will then be used for creating the video.\r\n\r\n   Output: The labels are stored as MultiIndex Pandas Array, which contains the name of the network, body part name, (x, y) label position \r\n\r\n           in pixels, and the likelihood for each frame per body part. These arrays are stored in an efficient Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) \r\n\r\n           in the same directory, where the video is stored.

By default the first (note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml).\r\n\r\n   gputouse: int, optional. Natural number indicating the number of your GPU (see number in nvidia-smi).

Mathis Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11229\r\n\r\n   dynamic: triple containing (state,detectiontreshold,margin)\r\n       If the state is true, then dynamic cropping will be performed. That means that if an object is detected (i.e. any body part > detectiontreshold),\r\n       then object boundaries are computed according to the smallest/largest x position and smallest/largest y position of all body parts. This  window is\r\n       expanded by the margin and from then on only the posture within this crop is analyzed (until the object is lost, i.e. <detectiontreshold). The\r\n       current position is utilized for updating the crop window for the next frame (this is why the margin is important and should be set large\r\n       enough given the movement of the animal).\r\n\r\n   Examples\r\n   --------\r\n\r\n   Windows example for analyzing 1 video\r\n   >>>
