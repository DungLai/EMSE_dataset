This flexibility allows one, for example, to easily reconstruct a varying number of tracks. As you rightly observe though, you could use it as follows:\r\n```\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\n\r\ncfg = deeplabcut.utils.read_config('config_path')\r\ndeeplabcut.stitch_tracklets(..., animal_names=cfg['individuals'])\r\n```\r\nThe above is the default when done via the GUI 😊\r\nI hope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/840729909/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4743152010,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc0MzE1MjAxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4743152010","actor":{"login":"pavelbugneac","id":50273042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjczMDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50273042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelbugneac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T17:59:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4743152014,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NDMxNTIwMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4743152014","actor":{"login":"pavelbugneac","id":50273042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjczMDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50273042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac","html_url":"https://github.com/pavelbugneac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavelbugneac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T17:59:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-13T18:17:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T18:17:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/r

What is important is the number of animal tracks to reconstruct (omitting the single individual, which is not really 'stitched' per se as it is only one unambiguous data sequence), and the number of 'multi' animal names given.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/842654610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4757060330,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc1NzA2MDMzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4757060330","actor":{"login":"felixhol","id":18172105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTcyMTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18172105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol","html_url":"https://github.com/felixhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-17T21:30:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4757060334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NTcwNjAzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4757060334","actor":{"login":"felixhol","id":18172105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTcyMTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18172105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol","html_url":"https://github.com/felixhol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixhol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-17T21:30:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
