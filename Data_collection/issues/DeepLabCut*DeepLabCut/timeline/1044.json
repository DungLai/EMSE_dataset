It required two additional steps for me\r\n1. To install  [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\r\n2. Downgrade numpy to version 1.19.3 using `pip install numpy==1.19.3`\r\n\r\nApparently, there is a [Windows bug](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1207405/fmod-after-an-update-to-windows-2004-is-causing-a.html) that causes numpy version 1.19.4 to fail a sanity check. I found another thread that said the bug is expected to be fixed by end of January 2021. Until then the advice is to downgrade numpy.\r\n\r\nI am, however, having a new issue with deeplabcut... This times it appears to be related to tensorflow.\r\nWhen I run  `import deeplabcut` I get this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call
