Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nAfter refining labels and retraining the network, we are having a trouble analyzing videos again. When running the analyze_videos() function, the output runs through without any errors:\r\n![Analysis Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85576484/129796441-c9f2efcd-75b1-4ed1-a162-7f71ad6f7885.PNG)\r\n\r\nHowever, the videos folder (default destination folder; also tried changing the destfolder) contains no .h5, csv, or pickle files. I have tried moving the videos to a different path, converting the .mp4 videos into .MOV or saving to another .mp4, and even retraining the network. I still run into the same issue where the analyze videos goes to completion on all videos in the path but does not output any results. I have used the same method of refining/retraining/analysis in the past for another cohort of animals and didn't run into this problem.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10/Google Colab\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2rc3\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGoogle Colab Pro\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Refine and retrain network\r\n2. run analyze_videos() --> no results\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nStarting to analyze %  /content/drive/Shareddrives/DeepLabCut_SRM_SharedDrive/ProjectFolders/Vanessa_Project_Folders/IKKBetaCA-Pilocarpine-OF_21vids_Atmpt3-VU-2021-07-26/videos/Trial61.mp4\r\n/content/drive/Shareddrives/DeepLabCut_SRM_SharedDrive/ProjectFolders/Vanessa_Project_Folders/IKKBetaCA-Pilocarpine-OF_21vids_Atmpt3-VU-2021-07-26/videos  already exists!\r\nLoading  /content/drive/Shareddrives/DeepLabCut_SRM_SharedDrive/ProjectFolders/Vanessa_Project_Folders/IKKBetaCA-Pilocarpine-OF_21vids_Atmpt3-VU-2021-07-26/videos/Trial61.mp4\r\nDuration of video [s]:  1202.32 , recorded with  25.0 fps!\r\nOverall # of frames:  30058  found with (before cropping) frame dimensions:  1280 960\r\nStarting to extract posture\r\nCropping based on the x1 = 230 x2 = 695 y1 = 510 y2 = 965.
