Try to label close interactions of animals for best performance. Once you label more, you can create a new training set and train.\r\n> \r\n> You can either:\r\n> \r\n> extract more frames from existing or new videos and label as when initially building the training data set, or\r\n> \r\n> extract outlier frames based on the videos you just analyzed. To do this, you first need to analyze a video and convert to tracklets (Step 1 and 2 in the Analyze Video tab of the GUI), then you load the tracklet file into the refine tracklet GUI, and “Save” without making any modifications (or run deeplabcut.convert_raw_tracks_to_h5(config_path, picklefile)). That will create the files needed in the Extract Outlier Frames tab of the GUI.\r\n\r\nAlternative path: (also from link above):\r\n\r\n`deeplabcut.analyze_videos(`\r\n\r\n`deeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(`\r\n\r\n`deeplabcut.stitch_tracklets(`\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, we ask you please post questions on the Image Forum, as more people see it / can chip in - we'd prefer to keep github for issues, hence the template we request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/933292009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5402466835,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5BM6c48fVG7zwAAAAFCAxoT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5402466835","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-04T09:08:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
