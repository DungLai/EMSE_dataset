@FroshVII, \r\n\r\nI was wondering if this issue has been solved?\r\n \r\nI started having this problem earlier this week on a Windows machine with `deeplabcut=2.2.0.6` and nothing in issues #536 or #571 solved the issue. I haven't tried this yet: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/571#issuecomment-596121632, hoping I don't have to roll back that much.\r\n\r\nI have updated to the latest NVIDIA driver for RTX 3090 `v512.15` and re-installed the anaconda environment from the `DEEPLABCUT.yaml` file, which results in:\r\n`tensorflow=2.8.0`, `cudatoolkit=11.6.0`, `cudnn=8.2.1.32`. \r\n\r\nThe Task-Manager shows GPU memory usage, but cuda engages only for 5-20 sec and then drops back to 0%. \r\n\r\n***EDIT\r\nSeems to be solved after all in https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1725#issuecomment-1076423223 and https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1620#issuecomment-1017935156 by changing `max_input_size` in the

When I switch to Colab to train, there are no errors but it gets stuck on training. I run deeplabcut.train_network, it loads the config and overwrites max_iters/display_iters/save_iters, it says \"Starting training...\" and then nothing happens. The cell appears to be running, but nothing else shows up.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10 Home\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nColab Pro GPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn Google Colab:\r\n\r\n`!pip install deeplabcut\r\n%reload_ext numpy\r\n%reload_ext scipy\r\n%reload_ext matplotlib\r\n%reload_ext mpl_toolkits\r\n\r\n!pip install --upgrade scikit-image\r\n!pip3 install pickle5\r\n\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\nimport pickle5 as pickle\r\n\r\nfrom google.colab import drive\r\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\r\n\r\nProjectFolderName = 'TST-AS-2022-03-03'\r\nVideoType = 'mp4'\r\nvideofile_path = ['/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/'+ProjectFolderName+'/videos/']\r\nvideofile_path\r\npath_config_file = '/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/'+ProjectFolderName+'/config.yaml'\r\npath_config_file\r\n\r\nshuffle = 1\r\ndeeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file, net_type='resnet_50', Shuffles=[shuffle], augmenter_type='imgaug', windows2linux=True)\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.train_network(path_config_file, shuffle=shuffle, displayiters=10,saveiters=50, maxiters=500000, allow_growth=True)`\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nConfig:\r\n{'all_joints': [[0], [1], [2]],\r\n 'all_joints_names': ['tip', 'mid', 'butt'],\r\n 'alpha_r': 0.02,\r\n 'apply_prob': 0.5,\r\n 'batch_size': 1,\r\n 'clahe': True,\r\n 'claheratio': 0.1,\r\n 'crop_pad': 0,\r\n 'crop_sampling': 'hybrid',\r\n 'crop_size': [400, 400],\r\n 'cropratio': 0.4,\r\n 'dataset': 'training-datasets/iteration-0/UnaugmentedDataSet_TSTMar3/TST_AS95shuffle1.mat',\r\n 'dataset_type': 'imgaug',\r\n 'decay_steps': 30000,\r\n 'deterministic': False,\r\n 'display_iters': 1000,\r\n 'edge': False,\r\n 'emboss': {'alpha': [0.0, 1.0], 'embossratio': 0.1, 'strength': [0.5, 1.5]},\r\n 'fg_fraction': 0.25,\r\n 'global_scale': 0.8,\r\n 'histeq': True,\r\n 'histeqratio': 0.1,\r\n 'init_weights': '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt',\r\n 'intermediate_supervision': False,\r\n 'intermediate_supervision_layer': 12,\r\n 'location_refinement': True,\r\n 'locref_huber_loss': True,\r\n 'locref_loss_weight': 0.05,\r\n 'locref_stdev': 7.2801,\r\n 'log_dir': 'log',\r\n 'lr_init': 0.0005,\r\n 'max_input_size': 1500,\r\n 'max_shift': 0.4,\r\n 'mean_pixel': [123.68, 116.779, 103.939],\r\n 'metadataset': 'training-datasets/iteration-0/UnaugmentedDataSet_TSTMar3/Documentation_data-TST_95shuffle1.pickle',\r\n 'min_input_size': 64,\r\n 'mirror': False,\r\n 'multi_stage': False,\r\n 'multi_step': [[0.005, 10000],\r\n                [0.02, 430000],\r\n                [0.002, 730000],\r\n                [0.001, 1030000]],\r\n 'net_type': 'resnet_50',\r\n 'num_joints': 3,\r\n 'optimizer': 'sgd',\r\n 'pairwise_huber_loss': False,\r\n 'pairwise_predict': False,\r\n 'partaffinityfield_predict': False,\r\n 'pos_dist_thresh': 17,\r\n 'pre_resize': [],\r\n 'project_path': '/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/TST-AS-2022-03-03',\r\n 'regularize': False,\r\n 'rotation': 25,\r\n 'rotratio': 0.4,\r\n 'save_iters': 50000,\r\n 'scale_jitter_lo': 0.5,\r\n 'scale_jitter_up': 1.25,\r\n 'scoremap_dir': 'test',\r\n 'sharpen': False,\r\n 'sharpenratio': 0.3,\r\n 'shuffle': True,\r\n 'snapshot_prefix': '/content/drive/My '\r\n                    'Drive/DLC/TST-AS-2022-03-03/dlc-models/iteration-0/TSTMar3-trainset95shuffle1/train/snapshot',\r\n 'stride': 8.0,\r\n 'weigh_negatives': False,\r\n 'weigh_only_present_joints': False,\r\n 'weigh_part_predictions': False,\r\n 'weight_decay': 0.0001}\r\nSelecting single-animal trainer\r\nBatch Size is 1\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer_v1.py:1694: UserWarning: `layer.apply` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
