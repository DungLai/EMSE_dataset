See your screenshot that states that there is an *error with the docker daemon*- the name \"containername\" is already in use, as you have linked to the same port many times. You need to remove these, as you can only have ONE. Also you can delete the exited containers. Please see here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0#docker-quick-tips\r\n\r\nAlso, you call and set -e twice, for home, be sure you create this correctly. I would suggest just trying this:\r\n\r\n`GPU=0 bash ./dlc-docker run -d -p 2351:8888 -e USER_HOME=$HOME --name dlctorben dlc_torben/dlcdocker`\r\n\r\nAlso, your GPU is too small to be useful for DLC; we recommend something >~1080 Ti. See here: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/wiki/FAQ\r\n\r\nI would also strongly advise against putting special characters into folder names, i.e. #203_xyz is not a great idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/574315721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2948201042,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0ODIwMTA0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2948201042","actor":{"login":"mlbudehaosi","id":59871930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODcxOTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59871930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi","html_url":"https://github.com/mlbudehaosi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-14T18:44:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2948201044,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NDgyMDEwNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2948201044","actor":{"login":"mlbudehaosi","id":59871930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODcxOTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59871930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi","html_url":"https://github.com/mlbudehaosi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbudehaosi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-14T18:44:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2948211043,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5NDgyMTEwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2948211043","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-14T18:47:30Z","label":{"name":"Docker","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2948221171,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50Mjk0ODIyMTE3MQ==","url":"
