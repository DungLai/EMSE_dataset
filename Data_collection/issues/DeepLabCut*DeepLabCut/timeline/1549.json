@MMathisLab,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for chiming in so quickly.\r\n\r\nI understand your reservations to wanting to selective about how the package is released and how is shared with others.\r\nI also understand that you have to devote your time where it is more needed to achieve your goals.\r\n\r\nThe docker images, environments, other supporting documentation you have provided have enabled us to jump start our projects. And for that we are truly grateful. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do think there are some shortcoming that come with each of those different solution that I believe that conda packages help solve. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges our team has faced is the discrepancy between package names in conda and on pypi. As you have mentionned, supporting the conda community is something that you have identified as useful evidenced by your work on conda environment. However, the pypi package depends on a package called `opencv-python-headless` (for one) that, to my knowledge. does not have a conda counterpart.\r\n\r\nThis causes pip and conda to clash when trying to integrate `deeplabcut` with other workflows.\r\n\r\nAn other great benefit of the conda-forge community has been its ability to move quickly on new platform like `osx-arm64` which was released last year by apple. Native tensorflow packages are availble for `osx-arm64` on conda-forge enabling this package to get installed on many new computers. Even if it is only used for the labeling workflow.\r\n\r\nMy goal in creating a conda package is to provide those that find conda useful with a path to easily integrate `deeplabcut` into their science.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not to fork your work.\r\n\r\nYour help in maintaining the conda-forge package would be greatly appreciated, but is not necessary. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I do not think it is realistic to expect your help in maintaining every esoteric package management system and operating system.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you would like to help, and have the bandwidth to do so, I would be glad to work with you on the conda packaging front especially in how it relates to the conda-forge channel.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, you can decide to help at any time. Conda-forge makes it very easy to suggest adding yourself as a maintainer even after a project (or \"feedstock\" as they call it) has been created.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/945217200/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hmaarrfk","id":90008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk","html_url":"https://github.com/hmaarrfk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5474872297,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c49S_0ezwAAAAFGU-vp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5474872297","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-17T23:33:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5474872300,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c49S_0ezwAAAAFGU-vs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5474872300","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-17T23:33:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5811073005,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5BM6c49S_0ezwAAAAFaXe_t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5811073005","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-23T18:02:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
