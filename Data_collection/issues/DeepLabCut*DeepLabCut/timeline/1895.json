at the moment returns `None`. Internally, there are two `try/except` blocks. The first try/except block looks for existing filtered data. The second try/except block looks for analyzed data to filter.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following - \r\n\r\n* In the first commit, the second/inner try/except block is pulled out of the first try/except block. The first try/except block continues to the next video in the for loop if filtered data is found.\r\n* In the second commit, the scope of the second try/except block is narrowed. Instead of finding and filtering the analyzed data in the try block, the try block only looks for the analyzed data now and the filtering happens outside.\r\n* In the third and final commit, the PR stores the mapping between video filename and the corresponding filtered data. If no videos are found, an empty dictionary is returned and if analyzed data isnt found, `None` is returned for the corresponding video filename.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton` at the moment returns `None`.\r\n\r\nSimilar to change in `deeplabcut.filterpredictions` earlier, the scope of the `try/except` is also reduced - now the skeleton calculations are performed outside the try/except block. And `deeplabcut.analyze_skeleton` returns a mapping from the video filename to the corresponding skeleton data. If analyzed data isn't found for a given video filename, `None` will be used and if a pre-existing skeleton data file is found, a dataframe will be loaded from the file.\r\n\r\nThis addresses one of the points mentioned in #1895 - `deeplabcut` functions returning information instead of returning `None`.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewer : It might be easier to review this PR
