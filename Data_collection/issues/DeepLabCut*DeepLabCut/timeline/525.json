Does it mean that during the label process, i also need to use the compressed video rather than original video to label for further training and analysis, or can i use the original video to label and do the further training and video analysis with compressed ones?\nThank you for suggestions,\nShauyin\n\nâ€”\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_AlexEMG_DeepLabCut_issues_525-3Femail-5Fsource-3Dnotifications-26email-5Ftoken-3DAE7CMXXYZ44HH6RKCNYBAITQYI7IBA5CNFSM4JZ64UKKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4IAB3YPQ&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=tHr2zeR0YtLr-t8l2lTtBZoqUUaRIarktFyaSF_Jj5c&s=YjZLusWyhFLyCQHj61R-t83fpKDKAo7TfvAjfJMf0VI&e=>, or unsubscribe<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_notifications_unsubscribe-2Dauth_AE7CMXQLOMJVUVEGISK7TQTQYI7IBANCNFSM4JZ64UKA&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=tHr2zeR0YtLr-t8l2lTtBZoqUUaRIarktFyaSF_Jj5c&s=GwmAI43K1oB8jhFJ-x148f1FnMII5tLXtL_oPvT_Vx0&e=>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/565022236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/565040706","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/525#issuecomment-565040706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/525","id":565040706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTA0MDcwNg==","user":{"login":"xiuxian620","id":40397232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk3MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40397232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620","html_url":"https://github.com/xiuxian620","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T14:55:49Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T14:55:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, Dear Alexander, \r\nThank you for the fast reply. \r\nI read through your paper, there is no mention about whether you used the compressed video to label and then used the compressed video for further training and analysis. \r\nCan i understand that i can used the uncompressed video to label, then with these label data, i continue the further training and video analysis with the compressed video?
