If you only added a few frames and train on top, it can not be worse, but just a different split of the data. I would recommend looking at video performance and seeing if it looks better. Pixel error is but just one metric.\r\n\r\nAlso, you should be mindful that with ResNet-101 you should make changes to the pose_cfg.yaml before training and set intermediate supervision to true. We really donâ€™t recommend 101 unless you really need it (complex scenes, etc). \r\n\r\nSee more here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/wiki/What-neural-network-should-I-use%3F","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/695192244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3784992223,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc4NDk5MjIyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3784992223","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-19T09:47:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/696111117","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/911#issuecomment-696111117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/911","id":696111117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjExMTExNw==","user":{"login":"cdj5044","id":62957755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTU3NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62957755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044","html_url":"https://github.com/cdj5044","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T13:22:04Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T13:22:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Mackenzie, \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your response and all the helpful info! I am analyzing the videos to look at video performance right now, as you suggested. \r\n\r\nRelated to using the ResNet-101, we only selected this ResNet based on the recommendation to use it for videos involving human subjects, at this documentation page: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#a-create-a-new-project. So thank you for forwarding the documentation specific to selecting the right neural network. \r\n\r\nI did actually train a model using ResNet-50 prior to switching to -101, and at least the pixel error was much worse: train/test errors of about 4 and 11 respectively. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCaleb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/696111117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cdj5044","id":62957755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTU3NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62957755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044","html_url":"https://github.com/cdj5044","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdj5044/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
