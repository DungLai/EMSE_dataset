As colab is always updating, I double checked that the demo data works on COLAB (i.e. https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB_DEMO_mouse_openfield.ipynb), trained great, and then used old weights, and that also worked. Then I made a typo in the path to double check, and that threw the correct error, i.e. no weights found. \r\n\r\n1) are you sure the old weights have the **identical bodyparts**? Seems the error: ``lhs shape= [3,3,12,2048] rhs shape= [3,3,23,2048]`` suggests that the old network was trained with **23** bodyparts, not **13**? To reuse the weights, the new data would have to be labeled with the idential named bosyparts. \r\n\r\nIf so, can you confirm:\r\n\r\n1) did you run `deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file)` within colab? \r\n2) then you downloaded and edited pose_cfg.yaml and re-uploaded?
