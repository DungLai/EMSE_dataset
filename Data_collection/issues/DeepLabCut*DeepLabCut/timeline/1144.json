we managed to run the efficientnet-b6 model in ticket #1144 on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (40GB mem), instead of a P100. A resnet_152 model was previously trained with the same training parameters as below, properly. However, switching to the efficientnet-b6, it seems that the default learning rate of 0.0005 is not being updated as it should, and hence the loss seems to be on an extremely slow converging path (see output below)!\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on what parameter to amend, please?\r\n\r\nThanks :-) \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraining parameters\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n'alpha_r': 0.02,\r\n 'batch_size': 1,\r\n 'crop_pad': 0,\r\n 'cropratio': 0.4,\r\n 'dataset_type': 'imgaug',\r\n 'decay_steps': 30000,\r\n 'deterministic': False,\r\n 'display_iters': 1000,\r\n 'fg_fraction': 0.25,\r\n 'global_scale': 0.8,\r\n 'intermediate_supervision': False,\r\n 'intermediate_supervision_layer': 12,\r\n 'location_refinement': True,\r\n 'locref_huber_loss': True,\r\n 'locref_loss_weight': 0.05,\r\n 'locref_stdev': 7.2801,\r\n 'log_dir': 'log',\r\n 'lr_init': 0.0005,\r\n 'max_input_size': 1500,\r\n 'mean_pixel': [123.68, 116.779, 103.939],\r\n 'min_input_size': 64,\r\n 'mirror': False,\r\n 'multi_step': [[0.005, 10000],\r\n                [0.02, 430000],\r\n                [0.002, 730000],\r\n                [0.001, 1030000]],\r\n 'net_type': 'efficientnet-b6',\r\n 'num_joints': 12,\r\n 'optimizer': 'sgd',\r\n 'pairwise_huber_loss': False,\r\n 'pairwise_predict': False,\r\n 'partaffinityfield_predict': False,\r\n 'pos_dist_thresh': 17,\r\n 'regularize': False,\r\n 'rotation': 25,\r\n 'rotratio': 0.4,\r\n 'save_iters': 50000,\r\n 'scale_jitter_lo': 0.5,\r\n 'scale_jitter_up': 1.25,\r\n 'scoremap_dir': 'test',\r\n 'shuffle': True,\r\n 'stride': 8.0,\r\n 'weigh_negatives': False,\r\n 'weigh_only_present_joints': False,\r\n 'weigh_part_predictions': False,\r\n 'weight_decay': 0.0001}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\noutput for efficientnet-b6\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n2021-04-10 02:53:38 iteration: 1000 loss: 0.0988 lr: 0.0004986578715033829\r\n2021-04-10 03:10:35 iteration: 2000 loss: 0.0249 lr: 0.0004946461995132267\r\n…\r\n…\r\n…\r\n2021-04-10 03:58:33 iteration: 9000 loss: 0.0183 lr: 0.00039900740375742316\r\n2021-04-10 04:03:32 iteration: 10000 loss: 0.0179 lr: 0.00037750002229586244\r\n2021-04-10 04:08:48 iteration: 11000 loss: 0.0182 lr: 0.000354650488588959\r\n…\r\n…\r\n…\r\n2021-04-11 12:21:47 iteration: 429000 loss: 0.0163 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05\r\n2021-04-11 12:26:16 iteration: 430000 loss: 0.0160 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05\r\n2021-04-11 12:30:51 iteration: 431000 loss: 0.0164 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05\r\n…\r\n…\r\n…\r\n2021-04-12 11:28:56 iteration: 729000 loss: 0.0161 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05\r\n2021-04-12 11:33:30 iteration: 730000 loss: 0.0159 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05\r\n2021-04-12 11:38:06 iteration: 731000 loss: 0.0160 lr: 1.0000000656873453e-05","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
