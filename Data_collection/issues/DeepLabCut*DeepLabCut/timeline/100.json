Yea, the auto-next slice option of fiji for the single body part labelling (which advances the frame at each measurement click, i.e. one kills two birds with one stone) is clearly the fastest method to create a training set. I'll try your conversion script and see how that all works in practice. I'll also contribute an import script to put the cvs location files of the single body parts - created with fiji - in the format DLC2 likes and add it to the DLCutils scripts.

Finally some example conversion code here: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DLCutils Hope it makes sense. Perhaps you could write a import function for the xls files from Fiji, if you like it so much?\r\n\r\nI just used your convertDLC1TO2.py to convert fiji-labeled points to DLC2, works well! Also, no need to write any more function, just having the .csv with the labels, then applying step 1,2,3,4 of DLC1 and following your instructions in convertDLC1TO2.py made me able to train using DLC2 syntax.\r\n\r\nI'll try the GUI labeling soon (although I have 400 images and 27 features, so maybe I need that single feature labeling in order not to go crazy).\r\n\r\nCheers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/446590306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschart","id":17218515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE4NTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17218515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart","html_url":"https://github.com/mschart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
