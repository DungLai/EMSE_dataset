Even with multiple graphically accelerated VNC sessions (confirmed by running [Unigine Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven) and possible by utilizing [VirtualGL](https://virtualgl.org/)) I would still get the `ImportError: Cannot load backend 'WXAgg' which requires the 'wx' interactive framework, as 'headless' is currently running` error.\r\n\r\nNon graphically accelerated sessions also didn't work, obviously. I tested many including NoMachine, ThinLinc, and XRDP.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the way deeplabcut-docker gui is setup requires local console :0. This can be accessed remotely via some session software, but multiple concurrent sessions never worked.\r\n\r\nSo unless someone more technical than me can figure it out it seems the only way of splitting up a GPU's (in my case a Tesla M40 24 GB) resources for deeplabcut-docker gui is with GPU partitioning via a hypervisor like VMware + Nvidia GRID or Windows Server Hyper-V + RemoteFX/GPU-P then creating multiple virtual machines each with their own slice of the GPU so that they can each present a localhost :0 console for deeplabcut-docker gui.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1047075011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"crsleeth","id":13802587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAyNTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13802587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth","html_url":"https://github.com/crsleeth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6113005339,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5Ai4_bzwAAAAFsXQ8b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6113005339","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-21T16:58:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6113005348,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5Ai4_bzwAAAAFsXQ8k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6113005348","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-21T16:58:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1058936292","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1618#issuecomment-1058936292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1618","id":1058936292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c4_HhXk","user":{"login":"crsleeth","id":13802587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAyNTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13802587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth","html_url":"https://github.com/crsleeth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crsleeth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T08:15:28Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T08:15:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nAfter a fresh install of docker for my ubuntu 18.04 system, I successfully pulled the deeplabcut-latest-gui-jupyter image from Dockerhub.  However, when I call 'deeplabcut-docker gui' on my terminal I get the following output:\r\n> \"ImportError: Cannot load backend 'WXAgg' which requires the 'wx' interactive framework, as 'headless' is currently running\r\n[2022-04-27T12:14:09-0700]: Failed to launch the DLC GUI.

I'm also new to WSL and Ubuntu, so possibly I am just misunderstanding some basic installation concept.
