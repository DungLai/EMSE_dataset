feature request from #987 . Added possibility to rotate video based on arbitrary angles using ffmpeg rotate. It uses radians which is a bit annnoying but I can try and change it for degrees. Also added a box to GUI. It's my first time doing anything like it so feedback will be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10.
