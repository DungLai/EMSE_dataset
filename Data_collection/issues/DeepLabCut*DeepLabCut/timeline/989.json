I don't know of any good/quick way to check those files, but i suspect everything from iteration-1 is fine. Its the new frames that were added that are causing the problem. You could go back to iteration-1 and this time only add half of your newly labeled frames (save the other half for later), then train the network and then X-validate and see if you get an error. If not, that means the problem frame is in the second half of your newly labeled images.
