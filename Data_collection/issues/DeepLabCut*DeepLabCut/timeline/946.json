However, I noticed when I launch DLC the GUI does not look the same as the one in the 2.2 multianimal youtube tutorial, and I do not have an option to click on 'is this a multianimal project?' when creating a new project. I'm able to extract frames, but when trying to label the frames, the pop-up window does not load the extracted frames.\r\nErrorlog:\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\nLast login: Wed Oct 14 12:59:08 on ttys000\r\n(base) user@persons-MacBook-Pro ~ % conda activate DLC-CPU\r\n(DLC-CPU) user@persons-MacBook-Pro ~ % pythonw -m deeplabcut\r\nStarting GUI...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/user/opt/anaconda3/envs/DLC-CPU/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/gui/create_new_project.py\", line 333, in create_new_project\r\n    page7 = Evaluate_network(self.parent,self.gui_size,self.cfg)\r\n  File \"/Users/user/opt/anaconda3/envs/DLC-CPU/lib/python3.7/site-packages/deeplabcut/gui/evaluate_network.py\", line 79, in __init__\r\n    self.bodyparts_to_compare = wx.CheckListBox(self, choices=bodyparts, style=0,name = \"Select the bodyparts\")\r\nTypeError: CheckListBox(): arguments did not match any overloaded call:\r\n  overload 1: argument 'choices' has unexpected type 'NoneType'\r\n  overload 2: too many arguments\r\nConfig file read successfully.\r\nExtracting frames based on kmeans ...\r\nKmeans-quantization based extracting of frames from 19.01  seconds to 23.01  seconds.\r\nExtracting and downsampling... 241  frames from the video.\r\n241it [00:00, 475.29it/s]\r\nKmeans clustering ...
