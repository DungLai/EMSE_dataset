I mean, I have successfully use deeplabcut GUI to label images and test video by 'pip install deeplabcut'. But if I want to design a new algorithm or function according to your work, how can I do that? In other words, how can I run the revised source code rather than using the unchangeable python package? Thanks.\n\nâ€”\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_AlexEMG_DeepLabCut_issues_573-3Femail-5Fsource-3Dnotifications-26email-5Ftoken-3DAE7CMXVHWTA3Z4CCNBDAGSLRBAUSZA5CNFSM4KPGMETKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4IKTUDZQ&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=qWU6KVmbgPGKTLRKlEiv551101jAjjLA_keO5sSWUdE&s=k-pTl6fPNDVb_42NivH_fxxoMOohgJG4hLhnJ-_5prk&e=>, or unsubscribe<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_notifications_unsubscribe-2Dauth_AE7CMXQYXROANBX7HSP5BXTRBAUSZANCNFSM4KPGMETA&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=qWU6KVmbgPGKTLRKlEiv551101jAjjLA_keO5sSWUdE&s=nidHEMvPyLdS_y2sOcIPD3PITFX9MIQkrZNhFSHM-3A&e=>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/581474347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3002705133,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzAwMjcwNTEzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3002705133","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-03T15:41:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3002706125,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMDI3MDYxMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3002706125","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-03T15:41:33Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
