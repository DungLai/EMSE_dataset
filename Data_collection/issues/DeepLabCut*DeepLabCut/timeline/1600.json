Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nThere are times that I do not care about the time-dependency of the features, nor is it a feature that i want to train the network, but that I want to label once in both images and then triangulate into a 3d space.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let’s say I place a ruler in my two FOVs to use as a conversion for unit conversion in 3d space. Instead of leaving the ruler in the videos and having DLC label them, I want to take one image with the ruler in both FOVs and then manually select 2 points that have known distances (because they are on the ruler).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to take those 2 points, each in it’s own camera view, and then use the camera calibration files to triangulate them? If so, how would I do that?
