  Thanks for the response.  I've reviewed the docs and the video, and while I understand how to start a new project like the one we're doing, our case is not exactly specified in the docs.   In particular, we have a multi-animal tracking project with all 4 animals were given unique labels (because of different body sizes and body labeling) and we'd like to take advantage of the DLC 2.2 prior information as DLC < 2.2 did not do very well tracking these animals. \r\n\r\nWe have labeled 2000 frames already as there was no indication that DLC>=2.2 required a different labeling method when working with animals of different sizes where a common skeleton might not work for all of them.  \r\n\r\nSo there are 4 animals of different sizes in each frame, and we labeled 16 features / frame.  We'd like to **connect the skeletons for each unique animal** and take advantage of the additional statistics from DLC >=2.2 because DLC<2.2 labels jumped around between animals a lot.  We don't need to take advantage of the automatic \"multi-animal\" fitting of DLC>=2.2 as we explicitly labeled everything, but we really need for the skeletons tools to be implemented.\r\n\r\nI read the documentaiton and it's not clear how to set up the multianimalbodyparts and uniquebodparts to get 4 skeletons setup for each of the animals.  My best guess is this, any help is appreciated:\r\n```\r\n\r\nindividuals: []  # there are no implicit multi-animal skeletons\r\nuniquebodyparts: [adult1_nose, adult1_leftear... adult2_nose, adult2_leftear... pup1_nose, pup1_leftear...]  # 16 body parts in total\r\nmultianimalbodyparts: []  # there are no shared bodyparts\r\nskeleton: [[adult1_nose, adult1_leftear], [adult1_nose,adult1_righear]....[pup1_nose, pup1_leftear]...]  # manually connect every single pair of points\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, should we still use the multi-animal flag in the config file?  Also, will this explicit specification take advantage of the skeleton priors to limit/correct jumping?\r\n\r\nIf this is not possible, then would collapsing the 4 animal labels (16 features) to a single \"common-animal\" set of features (4 features) be helpful?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the help, I apologize for the complicated situation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/642127358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/642133509","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/733#issuecomment-642133509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/733","id":642133509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjEzMzUwOQ==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T16:52:03Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T16:52:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"only
