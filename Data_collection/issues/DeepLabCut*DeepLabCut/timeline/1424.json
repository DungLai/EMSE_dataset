This is what is directly causing your problem: You don't state it, but I can tell from the files created that you are running a multi animal project. With maDLC projects, after `analyze_videos`, you have to run `convert_detections2tracklets` and `stitch_tracklets` **before** `plot_trajectories`, as stated in the [maDLC User Guide](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html) and in the [maDLC Colab example notebook](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB_maDLC_TrainNetwork_VideoAnalysis.ipynb). `stitch_tracklets` will produced the unfiltered files you need for `plot_trajectories`. You should not filter the data before plotting trajectories when you're evaluating your model's tracking ability, but you should filter data once you're happy with your model for data analysis.\r\n2. As a general suggestion, avoid spaces in your file names. It doesn't always cause problems, and it's not causing this problem, but it's good practice when dealing directly with computer code.\r\n3. You are running multiple versions of DLC. The commands I describe above, the user guide, and the colab example, are all based on `2.2rc3` with significant changes since 2.1.10.4. You should install 2.2rc3 at least in your colab notebook, recreate the training dataset (you can then use the new dlcrnet models which have worked really well for me), retrain, convert (using the ellipse tracker) and stitch. In fact, the ellipse tracker wasn't introduced until 2.2rc1, so 2.1.10.4 would throw an error for that tracker method anyways.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/884147294/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/884496396","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1424#issuecomment-884496396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1424","id":884496396,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c40uFgM","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T21:00:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T21:00:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@backyardbiomech
