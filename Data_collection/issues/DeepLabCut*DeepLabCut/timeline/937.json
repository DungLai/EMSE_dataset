Is there any value that prevents multiple labels from different entities from occupying the same space?\r\n\r\nMy videos also contain varying amounts of vervets. The max amount there was in a single video was 15, and so I trained the network assuming that max. That is also why my config.yaml contains 15 entities. I am curious if there was a way to set the max amount of entities on a video-to-video basis post-training?  Again, any help you are able to offer is much appreciated. Thank you for your continued patience and help. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/702978045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/702983850","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/937#issuecomment-702983850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/937","id":702983850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjk4Mzg1MA==","user":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T22:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T22:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Aw my bad, the csv file is actually produced after evaluating the network 😑.

again! Thanks for taking the time to answer some of my questions about the refinement. I took the advice, and the output is looking okay. I also went into the config file, and reduced the number of vervets in there to three (down from 15) and that drastically reduced the amount of multi-labeling I was getting. Unfortunately, I am still having issues with missing labels, labels in the wrong places, and incorrect identities etc, but it is much more manageable. I ended up tinkering with the inference file a bit more as well to really try to improve the tracking.\r\n\r\nThis is the inference file I decided to go with in the end, in case you were curious:\r\n```\r\nvariant: 0\r\nminimalnumberofconnections: 4\r\naveragescore: 0.1\r\ndistnormalization: 1500\r\ndistnormalizationLOWER: 200\r\ndetectionthresholdsquare: 0\r\naddlikelihoods: 0.15\r\npafthreshold: 0.015\r\nmethod: m1\r\nwithid: false\r\ntopktoretain: 3\r\nupperbound_factor: 1.25\r\nlowerbound_factor: .75\r\nboundingboxslack: 0\r\nmax_age: 20\r\nmin_hits: 1\r\niou_threshold: 0.4\r\n```\r\n In the end, I just decided to go ahead with the refinement. I am unsure if I have made a mistake in going ahead with the refinement here, but alas... It is quite annoying at the least to go through frame by frame and manually correct the majority of the labels. I am hoping that after refinement and retraining that my results will be a lot better. This is my first refinement phase after all. It is just extremely time-consuming.\r\n\r\nI hoped I could ask a few follow up questions, if it is not too much trouble. Firstly, with the number of missing labels, I was wondering if after merging the data set, and retraining, if those missing labels are going to interfere with the results? In general, would a retain after refinement improve results enough to make future refinements more manageable?
