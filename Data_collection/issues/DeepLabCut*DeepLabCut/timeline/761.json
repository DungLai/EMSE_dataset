I hadn't come across that yet. In the near future I will be setting up a dual boot on this computer anyway so the Linux advice will be useful when I get that going. (In the meantime I figured it would be useful to get it working on the native Windows since the OS came with the computer anyway and it might be handy in case students wanted to get going working on it with me who did not have any Linux experience.)\r\n\r\n**QUESTION*:* in that document I notice that one of the steps specifies CUDA 10.1:\r\n```\r\nwget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run\r\nsudo sh cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run\r\n```\r\nI thought that CUDA10.1+ was unsupported?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/647176917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"neurologic","id":4777333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzczMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4777333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic","html_url":"https://github.com/neurologic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
