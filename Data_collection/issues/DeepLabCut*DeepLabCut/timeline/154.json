I am still not certain if the GPU is being used by DLC correctly or not. Sorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\n**Your Operating system and DeepLabCut version**\r\nWindows 10, Anaconda 3, Python 3.6, DLC 2.0.1, Tensorflow 1.12.0, GPU: GTX 1060\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem**\r\nI am also having the same issue. I tried relabeling the data twice and made sure that the parameters in config.yaml matched (num joints, joint names, etc.). The training gets stuck at \"Starting training....\"\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the GPU is engaged, I run these lines of code to first check the number of the GPU\r\n\r\n```python \r\nsess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then to test a computation on the GPU.\r\n```python\r\nwith tf.device('/gpu:0'):\r\n    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')\r\n    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')\r\n    c = tf.matmul(a, b)\r\n\r\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\r\n    print (sess.run(c))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth work correctly and I see a spike in GPU activity when checking the activity in the task manager.
