you for your response! I decided to start a new project from scratch and see if I ran into the same issue. I'm just about to refine the labels so I wanted to double check with you that I'm doing this correctly.\r\n\r\nI did the \"refine tracklets\" step and clicked \"optional: merge refined data\" for a few different videos (merging after each video). Next I extracted outlier frames and went to the \"refine labels\" tab. When I launched the GUI I saw that I had these videos with hundreds of frames to label, which seems like a lot (see attached image). \r\n\r\nSo a few questions:\r\n1) Should I be merging the data/creating new datasets/training the network after refining the tracklets? Or can I refine tracklets, merge the data, refine the labels, merge that data, and then create a new training dataset with all of that together? 2) When I used the older (not multi-animal) version of DLC I would only do about 20 frames per video when refining. Is there a way to not refine the hundreds of frames per video that I've extracted? Is there a way to get rid of these frames that I've already extracted without messing up the data?\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you so much for your help. I hope this new project I've started will work and there was just some error I made the first time around!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"998\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-17 at 12 04 17 PM\"
