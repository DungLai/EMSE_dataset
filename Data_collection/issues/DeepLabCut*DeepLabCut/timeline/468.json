Otherwise, when it hits the image, it will crash. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf someone does bring back a project from a linux system and labels in windows again, then you would need to force all paths back into linux format.

you for the prompt reply! \r\nYes, I understand that. But in previous deeplabcut version, it worked fine with resnet with the same computer. The GPU usage is really low using resnet with the current deeplabcut version (about 10%). My concern is that current deeplabcut version (at least in my occasion) is not optimized in using the GPU or maybe new version of deeplabcut requires much higher specification. If using mobilenet the GPU usage is over 70%.  I'm not sure about the storage issue as my SSD has more than 100GB of free space.  I wonder if I can install the previous version (not the prototype) of deeplabcut.
