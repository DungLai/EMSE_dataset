in general, there were no terminal errors? nothing like a PyTables error while labeling?\"\r\n^ I did not notice any error messages but I have been having an issue where re-opening the file after I had closed it caused all the labels to be deleted, despite it being saved. It was as if opening it again caused it to re-write. The labels did not show up on the GUI and once I clicked save after re-opening, it deleted anything from the previous marking session.\r\nFor example: If I marked frame 1-10, saved and closed that file. I re-open it. The labels do not show for frame 1-10 on the GUI but the co-ordinates are in the .csv file. I then mark frames 11-25 and click save. The .csv will now only have co-ordinates for 11-25, and has deleted 1-10. \r\nI don't know if it is relevant but I thought I would mention.

Jessy, Thanks for replying so fast. It’s a single animal project. The analysis itself does not give any error. I’m using a trained network. We’re running it as described here: https://github.com/sylviaschroeder/PupilDetection_DLC/wiki. I’ve never had this problem before. Since the last update (I upgraded yesterday) I get no h5 file for both and because of that I can’t run any of the deeplabcut functions that rely on the h5 file. Running it on his computer still works (and he hasn’t done the upgrade).
