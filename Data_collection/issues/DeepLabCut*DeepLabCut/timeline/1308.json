I have the exact same issue with a small number of my videos. I added `split_tracklets=False` to the command `deeplabcut.stitch_tracklets` but this did not help. I also tried deleting the .pickle files generated and re-running `deeplabcut.analyze_videos` and this also did not help avoid the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat is the fix for this? I am confused by this thread. I am tracking a single animal in addition to an insect, which I treat as an 'object' in my maDLC model.
