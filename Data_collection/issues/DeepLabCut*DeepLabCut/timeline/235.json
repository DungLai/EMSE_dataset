Ok, it has been a bit of a maze trying to figure out what versions of what work together, so with the Geoforce GTX 1080ti I have CUDA 10 and TensorFlow 1.13.1, so I assumed I would have to change the TensorFlow version in the yaml file. I will try it without changing the version, it just doesn't make sense to me why conda list shows tensorflow1-gpu as 1.13.1 and why using that in the yaml file wouldn't work.

Now that I started using DeepLabCut in this environment I am still not sure if the correct thing to do` deeplabcut.train_network` is to run `activate  dlc-windowsGPU` and then run `import deeplabcut` and then ` deeplabcut.train_network` and if that is sufficient to ensure that DeepLabCut and Tensorflow are using the GPU.
