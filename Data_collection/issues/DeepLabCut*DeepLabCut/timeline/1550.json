, I have seen that kind of mixing of slashes on windows.

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nNote: This might be related to issue #1550.\r\n\r\nIn my team, we are annotating a large set of images in a distributed manner. Some are on Windows and some are one macOS.\r\n\r\nI started annotating the labels first and thus the annotation csv file was created on a mac.\r\nThe people on Windows are able to use DeepLabCut to annotate, but once they click 'Save' in the labeling gui, move to the next image and then come back to the recently annotated image, the annotations are missing. Only the picture is shown.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is due to the slash issue in the csv file. In fact, the data _is being saved_ to the csv file on Windows, but with slashes in a different direction:\r\n\r\n```csv\r\nlabeled-data/wall_video1_camera1/img03713.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,448.88407527032723,128.84763095070912,,,,,,,498.7107850021065,63.92191826990586,737.275031596686,137.90703272012354\r\nlabeled-data/wall_video1_camera1/img03736.png,251.0871366381126,245.10995365819406,385.4682628844264,130.35753124561154,294.8742451902823,223.97134952956048,,,403.5870664232551,287.3871619154613,331.11185226793987,320.60496840331416,441.33457379581523,260.20895660721806,,,331.11185226793987,213.40204746524364,269.2059401769414,175.65454009268365,467.0028788091561,115.25852829658754,,\r\nlabeled-data/wall_video1_camera1/img03737.png,241.57386056303366,238.4435191309878,,,290.10178824921286,219.42581774045814,,,360.2705485522016,326.31841521136624,332.72767067626205,315.1701074996764,446.83387901944,262.7074829740774,,,339.285498741962,206.96594441562837,264.5262587929833,173.52102128055895,448.14544463258005,125.6488764009498,,\r\nlabeled-data/wall_video1_camera1/img03828.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\nlabeled-data\\wall_video1_camera1\\img00668.png,,,984.8986799606797,621.075127088892,,,,,,,,,,,,,1049.824392641483,482.16429995787104,1099.6511023732623,510.85240556101667,,,,\r\nlabeled-data\\wall_video1_camera1\\img00725.png,,,1086.0619997191407,396.09998314843415,,,1227.9883940366112,380.1384600868089,,,,,987.2423388149944,439.613710811563,,,1185.7154191826994,337.2138716472406,1192.9701728342889,384.1636305485501,1027.4235563968878,526.4051407884529,,\r\nlabeled-data\\wall_video1_camera1\\img01386.png,,,216.35942985535735,699.5899424238169,,,,,,,,,,,,,140.8644151102373,545.5801123437718,195.22082572672372,522.9316079202358,,,,\r\nlabeled-data\\wall_video1_camera1\\img01418.png,,,133.31491363572525,257.1891560174132,,,,,,,,,,,193.71092543182135,384.020780789215,180.12182277769972,190.75354304170764,219.3792304451622,199.81294481112207,84.99810419884841,384.020780789215,121.23571127650604,661.8424350512568\r\nlabeled-data\\wall_video1_camera1\\img01812.png,220.88913074006456,509.34250526611424,210.31982867574777,284.3673613256565,234.75959000498978,456.52123643882175,,,,,,,,,,,231.833871348454,394.1059050993912,173.31949821773782,394.1059050993912,230.8586317962754,200.03323421584923,356.66453402731514,83.00448795441696\r\nlabeled-\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to always write with the slashes in the same direction?
