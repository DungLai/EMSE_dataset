Good to know that solves it :) \r\n\r\nre: the skeleton. You do have a lot of points (from the clips above), so there could be a lot of connections... there is a bit of \"limit\" in terms of speed, i.e., the more connections the slower it can become when you run inference. Given that, I wouldn't over connect every point; i.e. likely a given pupil doesn't need more than 1 connection to it's neighbor, but perhaps the hand you'd like to connect digit tips to the base of the wrist, other knuckles, etc. If that makes
