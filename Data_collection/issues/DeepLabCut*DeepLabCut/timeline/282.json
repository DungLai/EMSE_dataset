FYI, it only works when I use anaconda prompt to use python, but it doesn't work when I use Spyder. Still have no idea why it didn't work, but I hope this information can somehow provide some evidence. Again, than you sooooooooooooooo much!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/490579885/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xt17","id":50376505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc2NTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50376505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17","html_url":"https://github.com/xt17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xt17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/490581133","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/282#issuecomment-490581133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/282","id":490581133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDU4MTEzMw==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T17:39:49Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T17:39:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Keep
