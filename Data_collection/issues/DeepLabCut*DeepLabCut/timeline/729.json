I remembered though that during the workshop the batch size could create this kind of issues. If I set `batch_size: 1` in the `pose_cfg.yaml` file, then the training starts (will update on the outcomes). Is it really necessary to impose `batch_size: 8`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/641101782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alesantuz","id":7524938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjQ5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7524938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz","html_url":"https://github.com/alesantuz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3423522742,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQyMzUyMjc0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3423522742","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T07:50:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3423522747,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MjM1MjI3NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3423522747","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T07:50:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/641176522","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/729#issuecomment-641176522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/729","id":641176522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTE3NjUyMg==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T09:53:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T10:02:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, that’s a different error. :) I guess you did not run `cropandlabelframes` before creating the training set (we highly recommend for maDLC) your images are massive ... and if you change batch to 1 you need to change the learning rate!  I would highly recommend not changing batch size and simply run the above step to fit in on your gpu and doing batch training....\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB_maDLC_TrainNetwork_VideoAnalysis.ipynb\r\n\r\n> maDeepLabCut CRITICAL POINT: For multi-animal projects we are using not only different and new output layers, but also new data augmentation, optimization, learning rates, and batch training defaults. Thus, please use a lower save_iters and maxiters. I.e. we suggest saving every 10K-15K iterations, and only training until 50K-100K iterations. We recommend you look closely at the loss to not overfit on your data. The bonus, training time is much less!!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/641176522/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3424044594,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQyNDA0NDU5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3424044594","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-09T09:53:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/641185746","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/729#issuecomment-641185746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/729","id":641185746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTE4NTc0Ng==","user":{"login":"alesantuz","id":7524938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjQ5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7524938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz","html_url":"https://github.com/alesantuz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alesantuz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T10:08:25Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T10:08:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You guessed right, I did not run that.
