short clips of video where you know a super rare event occurs that you missed with our clustering tools. There are very very few programs that can handle such video editing; people are working on them (such as napari) but as you see, many video programs like BORIS, etc aren't going to handle such massive files... \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the GUI on the DEMO video data - which is about the max I would recomment, and I have no issues:\r\n\r\n![ezgif com-video-to-gif (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/80891338-57d5d700-8c91-11ea-9be4-ba786bcdba6c.gif)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/623008701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3296784740,"node_id":"MDE1OlVuYXNzaWduZWRFdmVudDMyOTY3ODQ3NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3296784740","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-02T20:25:21Z","assignee":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/625832465","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/654#issuecomment-625832465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/654","id":625832465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTgzMjQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"WernTanj","id":44802531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODAyNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44802531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj","html_url":"https://github.com/WernTanj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T14:06:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T14:06:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am aware that such movies challenge current video analysis tools. Thus, I am already working with short video clips (1 min) containing diverse behaviors for labeling and training. With 170fps the automatic frame extraction results in lots of similar frames. So I had to do it either iteratively- exract/delete similar frames/ extract etc. or just manual. Temporal downsampling is not an option since tracking paws in an open field scenario is tricky and does not work properly with 30fps. I can try spatial downsampling to ease the process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/625832465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WernTanj","id":44802531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODAyNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44802531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj","html_url":"https://github.com/WernTanj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WernTanj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
