So you needed to edit values? If the h5 was not created initially, you likely had a pytables installation error. Are you using the supplied Anaconda env? Please check the other GitHub issues for pytable related issues, installation can be an issue if you don’t use conda forge (and/or it’s not an issue with the supplied Anaconda env we provide).
