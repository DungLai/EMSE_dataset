Thanks for the suggestion though!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Was your environment clean before the installation? I am surprised you'd have pyqt installed otherwise.\r\n\r\nGood thought! The environments I tested were either brand new or installed from the DLC yaml, but this made me go hunting for why pyqt might be getting installed in these environments. Of note is that I use the Spyder IDE that comes with Anaconda - I noticed that all my environments had the Qt console program installed (a PyQt GUI), even though I had never installed that program. I did some tests and it seems like installing Spyder in an environment also automatically installs the Qt console. Uninstalling also seems like an all or nothing deal, where uninstalling one uninstalls both. \r\n\r\nDoes it seem likely that's the source of the problem then?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/804376284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aaroncherian","id":17153275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTUzMjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17153275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian","html_url":"https://github.com/aaroncherian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaroncherian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/804719245","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1149#issuecomment-804719245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1149","id":804719245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDcxOTI0NQ==","user":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T08:35:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T08:35:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can
