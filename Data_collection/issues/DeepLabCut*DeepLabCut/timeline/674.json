so everything works ;)\r\n\r\nWhat is plotted in the video is up to you - i.e. you need to set the `pcutoff` in the config.yaml file. `0` would plot everything, even low confidence points. `0.9` would only plot high confidence points - which for the demo would not yet be good, as the network is undertrained as to make the DEMO fast for you. \r\n\r\nSee [Figure 6a](https://t.co/Grkqck2tka) in our paper for more details:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-05-04 at 9 39 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/80971736-2ffa8680-8deb-11ea-957d-40a0e909e112.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Box 1](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9cbe71d962bc6eb4ceb3bdf788fed6bdb86229ac/68747470733a2f2f737461746963312e73717561726573706163652e636f6d2f7374617469632f3537663664353163396637343536366635356563663237312f742f3563343066343132346437613963306232636536353163312f313534373736303731363239382f426f78312d30312e706e673f666f726d61743d3130303077) on how to set `pcutoff`\r\n\r\n![Box1_updated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/80971657-18bb9900-8deb-11ea-99e9-130e7dbea70e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/623470626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3299924325,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI5OTkyNDMyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3299924325","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04T13:40:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3299924953,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyOTk5MjQ5NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3299924953","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04T13:40:30Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
