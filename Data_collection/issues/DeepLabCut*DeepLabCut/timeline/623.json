I have another question.\r\nI did a full text search for the 'p-cutoff' and found that there was no complete definition, just like 'We then used a p-cutoff of X (i.e. 0.9) to condition the X,Y coordinates for future analysis'. \r\nAfter evaluating the network, the csv shows different values. What's the difference between the two values of ' Train error' and 'Train error with p-cutoff' ?Where should I get the information?\r\nAnd my p-cutoff used is 0.6, In the example, it's 0.9. How should this value be determined in the config. yaml?\r\nLooking forward to your reply! thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/603740684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Xieyuanting","id":48749851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQ5ODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48749851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting","html_url":"https://github.com/Xieyuanting","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xieyuanting/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/604172590","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/623#issuecomment-604172590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/623","id":604172590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDE3MjU5MA==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T01:16:08Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T01:16:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi @Xieyuanting (1) the original paper explains the scoremaps well, which is what the `pcutoff` us thresholding. https://t.co/Grkqck2tka\r\n\r\n(2) the Nature Protocol paper also describes this, and in Box1 it has info (also here on github, but since it's an image, it's not searchable). https://rdcu.be/bHpHNhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#a-create-a-new-project\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/77600252-b1eabc00-6edd-11ea-816e-6039b34a486e.png)\r\n\r\n(3) I agree it should be easier to find a description of when one should change it, so I will update the docs for this (on the wiki).
