just now  pulled and installed #1270 [latest commit](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/1270/commits/67d1f3e9375d80008daa1fd233b0b6becbdc01d5) after running into a similar problem.  \r\n\r\nIn one set of videos (3 cameras of the same behavior for 3D), I have three birds. Based on the output of `create_video_with_all_detections`, one bird is well detected, one is mostly obscured (just 2 of 7 points visible), and one is visible but not well detected at all, so I wanted to extract outliers. The current model is working well for tracking most videos, so there is something about this particular video that is throwing it off.\r\n\r\nThe one bird is so poorly tracked that I know I really just need to extract frames and label. I'm thinking that simply a clearer error statement may be helpful for some users for when tracking is so poor that tracklets can't be stitched even with the fixes in this commit - and possibly an addition to the docs.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `dlc.stitch_tracklets(config, pickle, n_tracks=3)` I get the following traceback:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> n_tracks=3 Traceback</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\DLC22\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\managers.py in create_block_manager_from_blocks(blocks, axes)\r\n   1675                     make_block(\r\n-> 1676                         values=blocks[0], placement=slice(0, len(axes[0])), ndim=2\r\n   1677                     )\r\n\r\n~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\DLC22\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\blocks.py in make_block(values, placement, klass, ndim, dtype)\r\n   2741 \r\n-> 2742     return klass(values, ndim=ndim, placement=placement)\r\n   2743 \r\n\r\n~\\Miniconda3\\envs\\DLC22\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\internals\\blocks.py in __init__(self, values, placement, ndim)\r\n    142             raise ValueError(\r\n--> 143                 f\"Wrong number of items passed {len(self.values)}, \"\r\n    144                 f\"placement implies {len(self.mgr_locs)}\"\r\n\r\nValueError: Wrong number of items passed 42, placement implies 36\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-8-c1ec2e01a9bf> in <module>\r\n      5 for pick in pickles:\r\n      6     print(pick)\r\n----> 7     dlc.stitch_tracklets(config, pick, n_tracks=3)\r\n      8 \r\n      9 #
