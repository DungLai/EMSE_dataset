for the late response. I literally tested some of the stuff and compared both dockers( Yours vs eqs version).\r\n\r\nSo with original docker (i.e. running t he dlc-docker command) and `nvidia-smi` via jupyter terminal, I got the following:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23262857/54136687-3e693000-43ea-11e9-8062-3f645d749c95.png)\r\n\r\nHere, we can see that only 1 GPU that I designated is visible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, using eqs's dockerfile, I got the following:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-03-11 10-43-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23262857/54136856-8720e900-43ea-11e9-9336-858c2d48f8d7.png)\r\n\r\nHere, I see both GPUs... hence, in terms of GPU _visibility_, the original docker limits only one while the other one exposes both... \r\n\r\nSo on hardware? level, I can see why both GPUs would be occupied... but then we enforce only 1 GPU to be used as  @AlexEMG pointed out. So this is still puzzling to me.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it does not stop me from training or predicting videos any sort. It is a pesky harmless bug? if using eqs dockerfile, but with the original docker file, it is not a problem.\r\n\r\nIdk whether I should close this issue or not, but I think it is fair to close since I opened the ticket on the other git repo. Feel free to close this one if you want to :D\r\n\r\nCheers,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/471598400/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DonnieKim411","id":23262857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjYyODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23262857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411","html_url":"https://github.com/DonnieKim411","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonnieKim411/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2194377087,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5NDM3NzA4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2194377087","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T15:49:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2194377089,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTQzNzcwODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2194377089","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T15:49:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2194435586,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE5NDQzNTU4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2194435586","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-11T16:06:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
