Those (with some fixes regarding TF versions, defaults etc.) are in DeepLabCut and up-to-date.  Other parts were removed (perhaps not fully, because we internally use some more features).\r\n\r\nThe **modularized DLC** version will indeed be pip installable, and crucially have all features (extract frames, label frames with pyhon GUIs, create training set, train, evaluate networks as well as analyze videos and much more) as functions. I don't know what your goal with DLC is so, I don't know if you might want to perform your \"own cleanup\", or wait for the modularized version. However, I hope my description helps you to guide your decision making. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexander","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/428365297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1894051503,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg5NDA1MTUwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1894051503","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-09T21:50:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/428390327","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/78#issuecomment-428390327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/78","id":428390327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODM5MDMyNw==","user":{"login":"cxrodgers","id":615121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTEyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/615121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers","html_url":"https://github.com/cxrodgers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxrodgers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T23:45:16Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T23:45:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @AlexEMG!
