Is that switch already present in the video produced by `create_video_with_all_detections`? That would help diagnose whether this is a tracking issue. If the video does look great, I am not convinced that increasing the visibility of that spot would help tracking (although labeling more bodyparts probably would). Could you also tell us what settings you used to refine the tracklets (e.g., were tracking parameters cross-validated?, was it with the box tracker?)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/670446647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3632668668,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYzMjY2ODY2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3632668668","actor":{"login":"DorianBattivelli","id":66886884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66886884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianBattivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T10:21:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3632668671,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MzI2Njg2NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3632668671","actor":{"login":"DorianBattivelli","id":66886884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66886884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianBattivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-07T10:21:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/670683790","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/842#issuecomment-670683790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/842","id":670683790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDY4Mzc5MA==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"creat
