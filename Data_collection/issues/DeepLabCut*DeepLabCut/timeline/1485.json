GPU usage is shown based on some internal calculations that might differ between different die architectures, drivers, workloads etc. A well optimized workload might show low GPU usage as in, at given time the resources (CUDA cores for instance) are utilized in 2-3% but when you look at the memory usage, with DLC (more specifically it's tensorflow that allocates it) the memory will be almost entirely allocated (doesn't have to be used entirely but it's reserved for this workload anyway). So in reality, though a lot of memory is being used, calculations performed on data located in this memory are very efficient (and might be bottlenecked by the memory bus - how much data can be transferred from memory to the GPU to be processed) and don't need to use more than the 2-3% of your cores. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, what you should look at if you're not sure if your training/inference is being done on the GPU look at the GPU memory usage and if the Tensorflow device was created using GPU_device (printed when running e.g. training) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/909174928/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/909224502","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1485#issuecomment-909224502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1485","id":909224502,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c42Mao2","user":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-31T13:12:23Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T13:12:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I think this would be another good page for the cookbook (“How to tell if deeplabcut is fully using your GPU”) since it has come up repeatedly.
