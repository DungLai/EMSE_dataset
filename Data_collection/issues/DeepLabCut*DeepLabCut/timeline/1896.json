All dlc functions work from that project path. \r\n\r\nThe one exception is when you create a training dataset, that must be performed on the computer on which training will occur.  So, if they want to continue refining the model, they should run `merge_datasets` to advance the iteration, and create a new training dataset.  Before training, the would add their local path to the last best snapshot as `init_weights` in `pose_cfg.yaml`. In other words, other than editing the project path, they would do nothing differently than if they started the projectyon their computer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1176581783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1179037154","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1896#issuecomment-1179037154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1896","id":1179037154,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5GRq3i","user":{"login":"CBroz1","id":9404707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9404707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1","html_url":"https://github.com/CBroz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CBroz1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-08T14:13:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T14:13:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the advice!
