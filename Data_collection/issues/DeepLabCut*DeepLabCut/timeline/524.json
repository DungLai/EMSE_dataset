I have re-followed the instructions and trying with different versions of CUDA and drivers. I have tried with the recommended CUDA 9 with Nvidia driver 384, but then I ran into the issue 'InternalError: cudaGetDevice() failed. Status: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version'. \r\nGiven that my GPU is Nvidia Quadro M1000M, I tried with later drivers compatible with it, such as 411.63, but then I again ran into the first issue: DLC is not able to run the network on the GPU. \r\nSo to test the CUDA installation I also ran in python (as suggested in the guide)\r\n`import tensorflow as tf`\r\n`sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))`\r\nAnd this is what I get \r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot
