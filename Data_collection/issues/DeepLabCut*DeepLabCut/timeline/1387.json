Here is the forum: https://forum.image.sc/tag/deeplabcut\r\nHere are our technical considerations: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md#technical-considerations\r\n\r\nNote, the hard drive (SSD) and CPU is really independent, as it's not used much/ is up to you how much data storage you need, etc. We use standard Dell workstations, as discussed in the link above.\r\n\r\nRe speed: Your images are very large (1920 by 1080), and indeed **by default we cap the images at 1500** in the `pose_cfg.yaml` file. Also please not videos are not used in training - ONLY the frames you label are used. I would suggest trying to crop them down if you can, as the GPU 1660 is quite small; and minimally, you need to change `pose_cfg.yaml` file to train properly.
