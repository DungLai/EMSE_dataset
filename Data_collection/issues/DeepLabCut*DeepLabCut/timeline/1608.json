If you don't have any animal body parts there, or have them but didn't label any, you should expect errors. \r\n\r\n>I am using multi animal mode but I'm only evaluating a single animal.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to deeplabcut, I would strongly advise against this until you have fully trained a single animal model for your scenario and determined that it is insufficient and the added features of the multi-animal tracking might be beneficial. However, using maDLC for single animal is about to get quite a bit smoother.\r\n\r\n> (1, 1796, 2412, 4)\r\n\r\nYou also appear to have very large frames. Did you increase `max_input_size` to 2412 (or more) in `pose_cfg.yaml` in both test and train folders in dlc-models? With maDLC now doing autocropping for training, I don't think this should cause any problems, at least for training, but it might be worth changing it anyways.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/991307362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/991318119","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1608#issuecomment-991318119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1608","id":991318119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c47FlBn","user":{"login":"linkedList123","id":95896835,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbdFAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95896835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedList123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedList123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-10T21:47:31Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T21:56:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@MMathisLab Thank you very much for this response. \r\n\r\nI confirmed that the subfolder of just the video name in the labeled-data folder has only the unlabeled pictures, as well as a data collected csv and h5 file. \r\n\r\nAlso, it says the version I have for deeplabcut is 2.2.0.3.
