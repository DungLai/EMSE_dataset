It did not fix the issue.\r\nAlso, I searched ```/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu``` for any version of ```libcudart.so```, but found none.

I'm worried about accidentally messing up my graphics drivers in chasing this dependency chain, so any help is greatly appreciated.

Installing SimBA with the ```--no-deps``` flag fixed had fixed that issue, so I just now decided to try wiping DLC from the computer and re-dowloading as follows:\r\n```\r\nconda deactivate\r\n\r\nconda env remove -n DEEPLABCUT \r\n\r\nsudo rm -r /home/blackmonlab/DeepLabCut/\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git  \r\n\r\ncd /home/blackmonlab/DeepLabCut/conda-environments  \r\n\r\nconda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml  \r\n\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT \r\n\r\npip install 'deeplabcut[gui]' --no-deps\r\n```\r\n... this did not work. However, the ```pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]' --no-deps``` gave the following message:\r\n```\r\nRequirement already satisfied: deeplabcut[gui] in /home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8/site-packages (2.2.0.6)\r\n```\r\n... which I thought is interesting given that ```which python``` indicates that python is being sourced from the ```/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/bin/python``` directory rather than the ```/home/blackmonlab/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT/lib/python3.8``` directory. Could this prohibit the DeepLabCut GUI features from being accessed from within Python?\r\n\r\nI also tried installing ```wxpython``` as follows:\r\n```\r\nconda install -c anaconda wxpython\r\n```\r\n... but got the following errors:\r\n```\r\nCollecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done\r\nSolving environment: failed with initial frozen solve.
