Everything else should be fine and the fix is straightforward (see below). Anyway, _I would recommend to always check the labels (output of Step3) before you proceed to training, just to makes sure the importing of all labels is correct._\r\n\r\n@imagejan thanks for your suggestions!\r\n\r\nThe code does not rely on _png_'s, but they are \"baked in\" a little bit. See line 88 in Step2. If you use different files, then you need to update:\r\n\r\nfiles = [\r\n                fn for fn in os.listdir(os.curdir)\r\n                if (\"img\" in fn and **\".png\"** in fn and \"_labelled\" not in fn)\r\n            ]\r\n\r\nAlso in Step3: line 84. \r\n\r\n    files = [\r\n        fn for fn in os.listdir(os.curdir)\r\n        if (\"img\" in fn and **\".png\"** in fn and \"_labeled\" not in fn)\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n- one can fix this by just exchanging the endings. I understand that several users start from Step2 (rather then 1 as they already have some frames that might be in a different format). As I said this is easy, but one needs to update those lines then.\r\n\r\nI think in a future release, I will make the filetype a variable in myconfig (just like for videos, where one can select mp4 / avi in myconfig_analysis etc.). However, this would still need to be seamlessly integrated with step1.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor points:\r\n- the code can import comma, or tab separated _csv_s, see https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/10\r\n- we use Fiji (rather than imageJ) and it seems that some of the elements in the csv file are different (although again, I don't think this is the problem).\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexander","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/400361664/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1701800801,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTcwMTgwMDgwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1701800801","actor":{"login":"imagejan","id":2033938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzM5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2033938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan","html_url":"https://github.com/imagejan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-26T15:51:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1701800803,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MDE4MDA4MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1701800803","actor":{"login":"imagejan","id":2033938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzM5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2033938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan","html_url":"https://github.com/imagejan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imagejan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-26T15:51:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/400366485","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/24#issuecomment-400366485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/24","id":400366485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDM2NjQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-26T16:01:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T16:01:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"\"On

the latest push, I added a variable in [the configuration file](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/myconfig.py) called ```imagetype=\".png\"``` that simplifies the use of other image formats than png. Just change the ending to whatever format you are using, when you start with step 2 and want to import other image types. \r\n\r\n**If you are skipping step1 (i.e. don't use our png file extractor), then you need to do several things (to make sure that the csvs from Fiji and the images are correctly imported in Step2 and subsequently processed in Step3 & 4.)**\r\n\r\nA) change the file-ending in the myconfig file to the image format you are using: imagetype=\".png\". \r\nB) make sure that the folder structure is like after \"our step1\", i.e. a create a folder with \"data-TASKNAME\" that contains several subfolders each containing images + annotation csv files\r\nC) Ordering. It is key that the order of the Fiji annotation files (csv) and the python loading of the images will match! For this purpose we suggest you either carefully check that manually, or just use a scheme like e.g.:\r\nimg0000.jpg\r\nimg0001.jpg\r\n...\r\nimg9999.jpg\r\netc. to be sure! (make sure the number of digits is constant, i.e. pad img1.jpg to img0001.jpg). \r\n\r\nThen everything should work! However, make sure you get labeled images after Step3 that match what you annotated in Fiji, before you proceed to training DeepLabCut!\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Why should \"img\" be a subset of the filename? - Consider line 88 of https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/Generating_a_Training_Set/Step2_ConvertingLabels2DataFrame.py\r\n\r\nfn for fn in os.listdir(os.curdir)\r\n                if (**\"img\" in fn** and imagetype in fn and \"_labelled\" not in fn)\r\n            ]\r\n\r\nthis is why.
