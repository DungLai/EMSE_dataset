I'm using DeepLabCut to run inference on a remote machine, i.e. a cluster with no GUI. I'm using deeplabcut 2.07.1. Matplotlib version was 3.0.3. I'm only using one function, `analyze_videos`. To get my code to run, I had to simply comment out the `mpl.use('TkAgg') ` command in the following places: \r\n\r\n- deeplabcut/utils/visualization.py\r\n- deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/trainingsetmanipulation.py\r\n- deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/vis_dataset.py\r\n- deeplabcut/utils/make_labeled_video.py\r\n\r\nGiven that I'm not using
