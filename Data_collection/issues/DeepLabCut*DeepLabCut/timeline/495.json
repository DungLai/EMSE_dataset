That will not work... the board is used to compute the intrinsic camera parameters, and by using the mirror you are messing this up quite a lot. You need to take an image such that it's only trying to correct for the lens distortion. So, in short, that is likely the issue is that 1) not a stereo pair, 2) it cannot correctly compute the disotorions given how you are taking pictures of the
