- Then all is fine; the error is only because you are not using the latest deeplabcut; the testscript works with the current repo, so if you want to install the current repo you would need to install from github: https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/recipes/installTips.html#how-to-use-the-latest-updates-directly-from-github\r\n\r\n BUT, DLC installation is working for you, ie it trains, etc so don't worry about this error.

System Information **\r\nOS: MacOS 10.15.17\r\nDeepLabCut Version: Latest version, downloaded today (20 July 2021)\r\nAnaconda env used: DEEPLABCUT (from DEEPLABCUT.yaml)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Problem Description**\r\nDirect reference to my recent response to #1413 (reposting as a separate issue because #1413 was closed). When I run testscript.py, as described in the tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s) immediately after installing DLC and then activating the conda environment, the execution of the program seems to throw multiple exceptions and errors which do not appear in the video. A lot of the data and messages about training the network also do not appear for me. Not sure why. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-20 at 4 23 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37655744/126407757-66c9a5bc-47a6-401c-9a3e-ebc600cf2b54.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-20 at 4 22 40 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37655744/126407759-660d7766-d3ae-4219-90fe-849bd01ca57b.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAlso had some interesting, potential \"error\", messages thrown during the installation of the conda environment from the .yaml file (i.e. when executing conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml). Not sure if this is relevant.
