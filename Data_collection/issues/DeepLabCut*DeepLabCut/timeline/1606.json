@DorianBattivelli, it is generally better to create the training datasets on the machine where the model will be trained, so move the labeled data to your virtual machine and run `deeplabcut.create_training_dataset` there. Note that this won't be necessary anymore in deeplabcut 2.2.1 thanks to #1584.\r\nAlso double check that the `project_path` in the config.yaml is up-to-date after moving the files: your config and training files seem to reside in /g/gross... whereas it's trying to load the data in a F:\\\\ disk (of your local Windows machine I suppose). I hope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/995757921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5777914887,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5AIjN1zwAAAAFYY_wH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5777914887","actor":{"login":"DorianBattivelli","id":66886884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66886884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianBattivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T12:11:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5777914891,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5AIjN1zwAAAAFYY_wL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5777914891","actor":{"login":"DorianBattivelli","id":66886884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66886884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/DorianBattivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DorianBattivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T12:11:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5777916620,"node_id":"LE_lADOB5BM6c5AIjN1zwAAAAFYZALM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5777916620","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T12:11:40Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz"
