You need to use the middle mouse key. The new GUI also allows intermediate saving, moving all points at any point, going back and forth ... It is really convenient - let me know how it works for you!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexander\r\n\r\nP.S. now one can also add (missed) labels at any later point: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/147\r\nP.P.S: before 2.0.4 the solution for deleting was to use the refinement GUI (and adjust the original labels). This method could not add points though, now adding, removing & changing are supported.
