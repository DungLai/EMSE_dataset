The version the reporter is using is built completely from source in our module system with all dependencies from scratch.\r\n\r\nWe're probably going to patch this on our site to put the location of ResNet downloads somewhere in the project path or into the part of the user's home directory that is writable by compute nodes.\r\n\r\nOptimally it would be nice if either the location was configurable in some way or if DLC was aware of this kind of scenario and put the files into the best reasonable place that was writable by the user.

because of the problem in downloading the initial weights. Rather the error seems to be thrown while trying to open and read the config file in the train directory (train.py). I had trained the network on HPC2N last week, however this week, while trying on another project it gave the above result. By comparing the pose_cfg.yaml files in the two project folders, it seems that the latest one has a difference in the **field 'all_joints_names'**. Instead of just a list of the joint names, the new pose_cfg.yaml has the following form:\r\n```\r\nall_joints_names: !!python/object/new:ruamel.yaml.comments.CommentedSeq\r\n  listitems: [w1p1, w1p2, w1p3, w1p4, w1p5]\r\n  state:\r\n    _yaml_format: !!python/object/new:ruamel.yaml.comments.Format\r\n      state: !!python/tuple\r\n      - null\r\n      - {_flow_style: false}\r\n    _yaml_line_col: !!python/object:ruamel.yaml.comments.LineCol\r\n      col: 0\r\n      data:\r\n        0: [13, 2]\r\n        1: [14, 2]\r\n        2: [15, 2]\r\n        3: [16, 2]\r\n        4: [17, 2]\r\n      line: 13\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen I manually changed the form to just the list, it throws no error, and the training process is initiated. However I would like to know what is the reason for the change in this yaml file and if there is some solution to this.
