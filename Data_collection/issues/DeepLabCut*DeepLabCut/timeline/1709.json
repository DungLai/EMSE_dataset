A re-projection error is also computed using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters which provide an estimate of how good the parameters are. The transformation between the two cameras are estimated and the **cameras are stereo calibrated**. Furthermore, the above function brings both the camera image plane to the same plane by computing the stereo rectification. These parameters are stored as a pickle file named as stereo_params.pickle under the directory camera_matrix.\r\n\r\nBut, I added the term higher up, and link to the code (which is where you could
