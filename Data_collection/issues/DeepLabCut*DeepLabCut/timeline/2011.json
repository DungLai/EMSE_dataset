I tried with the M1 yaml file initially and it also did not work. I do not remember the error message. I removed every DLC file from my computer and restarted the whole installation by following the guidelines you linked. I am using python 3.9 and after I run : conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT_M1.yaml , I get this error message:\r\n\r\nCollecting package metadata (repodata.json): done\r\nSolving environment: failed\r\n\r\nResolvePackageNotFound: \r\n  - python=3.7\r\n\r\nI also tried installing python 3.7 using brew and resolving some packages but I still cannot get it to work. Any piece of advice is most welcome!

I'm not at all a DLC expert but I tried to install DLC on an M1 recently and had the same trouble. I think the error above comes from the fact that there is no python3.7 on conda for the new arm64 Mac architecture. Also [the instructions](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/recipes/installTips.html?highlight=m1#deeplabcut-m1-chip-installation-environment-instructions) tell you that you should use \"Rosetta wheel for TensorFlow\", which means you should run things as if you were using an old Mac with x86 chip using Rosetta for translation. To do that you need to convert your conda environment (I'm not sure why this isn't explained anywhere in the installation instructions, but it's a very common procedure also for other Python packages). What has worked for me is:\r\n1. Create a new empty environment:\r\n```\r\nconda create -n DEEPLABCUT_M1\r\n```\r\n2. Activate the environment and set it to use the old x86 architecture:\r\n```\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT_M1\r\nconda env config vars set CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64\r\n``` \r\n3. To make the change effective, deactivate and reactivate the environment:\r\n```\r\nconda deactivate\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT_M1\r\n```\r\n4. Use the ```DEEPLABCUT_M1.yaml``` file to install necessary software:\r\n```\r\nconda env update -f DEEPLABCUT_M1.yml\r\n```\r\n5. Force re-install tensorflow as explained in the instructions:\r\n```\r\npip install tensorflow-2.4.1-py3-none-any.whl --no-dependencies --force-reinstall\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you should be able to start deeplabcut with ```pythonw -m deeplabcut ```. Note that this won't use your GPU and also not exploit the CPU optimally as it will \"translate\" the code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1285028892/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"guiwitz","id":4622767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjI3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4622767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz","html_url":"https://github.com/guiwitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guiwitz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7627845208,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5Tve2ozwAAAAHGp65Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7627845208","actor":{"login":"IamJaz","id":115576372,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuOONA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115576372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz","html_url":"https://github.com/IamJaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T06:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7627845213,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5Tve2ozwAAAAHGp65d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/7627845213","actor":{"login":"IamJaz","id":115576372,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuOONA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115576372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz","html_url":"https://github.com/IamJaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamJaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T06:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1285782781","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2011#issuecomment-1285782781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/2011","id":1285782781,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5Mo3z9","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T15:46:06Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T15:46:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey

everyone, \r\n\r\nApologies for the late reply! \r\n\r\n@guiwitz thank you for sharing what you did. I tried it on my end and still can't get it to work.

At the end, it said: \r\n\r\n\"An unexpected error has occurred. Conda has prepared the above report.\r\n\r\nIf submitted, this report will be used by core maintainers to improve\r\nfuture releases of conda.\r\nWould you like conda to send this report to the core maintainers? [y/N]:\"\r\n\r\nBut somewhere above, I also noticed this: \"conda-build version : not installed\".
