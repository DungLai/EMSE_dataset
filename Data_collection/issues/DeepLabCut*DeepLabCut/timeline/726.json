When sharing a DLC project across many computers, currently we manually edit the paths in the config file.\r\nIs there currently a way built into DLC to avoid having to do this?\r\n\r\nYou only need to point to the location of the `config.yaml` file, and it automatically updates the project path. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/680#pullrequestreview-409597920\r\n\r\nAlso, to be clear, the only path that ever needs update is just the `project_path` \r\n\r\n\r\nalso, we would kindly ask that if you have questions, please post on the user forum:
