consider a solution for this problem, I would like to ask that a provision be made for not including a progress bar at all.\r\n\r\nIn many environments, the user may wish to use jupyter notebooks (which don't play well with the terminal based tqdm), a different environment where the terminal tqdm doesn't really work well. `trange` is convenient when working on your own, but I find it pretty tedious when it comes to integration time.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you ever wish to present the users with a progress bar in the GUI (wx or Qt), you'll have to develope an other solution.\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with solution to a similar problem in my own work. We pass a `tqdm-like` object constructor for the inner functions to call to report their progress. That said, it doesn't work well in this \"pool\" scenerio. Mainly it assumes that there is only one thread controlling the bar progress. Not infinitely many.\r\nWhen the user doesn't want a progress bar, the argument `tqdm=None` is specified. We typically choose to have `tqdm=None` be the default.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Pseudocode\r\n# Do not import tqdm\r\n# from tqdm import tqdm\r\ndef tqdm_none(*_, **__):\r\n    return _[0]\r\n\r\ndef my_super_long_function(list_to_analyse, *, tqdm=None):\r\n    if tqdm is None:\r\n        tqdm= tqdm_none\r\n    for item in tqdm(list_to_analyse):\r\n        # Do useful work\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n# Without progress bar\r\nmy_super_long_function(list(range(10)))\r\n# With progress bar\r\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm as tqdm_i_really_want\r\nmy_super_long_function(list(range(10)),
