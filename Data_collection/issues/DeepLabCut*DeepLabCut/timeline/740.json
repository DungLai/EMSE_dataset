Also please don't just dump the terminal, the relevant point is the fourth set of errors you posted); seems you ran several steps (1-3), and the training_dataset was not successful at first but then you didn't crop and label, and trying batch-training with batchsize=8, and your GPU is too small to handle whatever your image sizes are, but looking massive: `[8,2048,48,60]`. \r\n\r\nAlso, you should not just change the batch size, as you need to then change the learning rates, etc. So, really, the best path forward is to just fix the first error that your video file/unconnected parts are not allowing you to run cropandlabelframes. \r\n\r\n> FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
