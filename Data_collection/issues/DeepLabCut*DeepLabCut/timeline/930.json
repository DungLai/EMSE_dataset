It then allows you to use `refine_labels` move labels around (you select the p-cutoff on launch) to signify high vs low confidence dots (filled or hollow circles). This is documented in the docs and more extensively in the Nature Protocols paper. You cannot add labels, as in pose estimation every label is there.\r\n\r\n(2) Tracking is where you can loose labels, as there is an initial cutoff step. As we assume the pose estimation is very good. See here for the workflow of 2.2 (before we release the full paper): https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/maDLC_AdvUserGuide.md\r\nHere the refine_labels is the only for pose estimation, not tracking. If you want everything to show up in the tracklet GUI, you need to firstly double check your inference_cfg.ayml parameters, then load the pickle file--you can set max gap to fill to \"0\" which fills in every point. If you do this, the confidence value of those filled in points is 0.01; so when you create_a_labled_video, if you want to see them all, you need to set `pcutoff `to 0 in your config.yaml
