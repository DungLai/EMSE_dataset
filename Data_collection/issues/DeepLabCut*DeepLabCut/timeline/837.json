When I run this dockerfile on NixOS 20.03 host it works fine, but running on Ubuntu 20.04 host leads to the aforementioned \"LossTensor is inf or nan\" problem. Natively running on Ubuntu 18.04 also works (haven't tried docker yet).\r\n\r\nOn NixOS, I'm using 440.82 as the driver, and on Ubuntu, I'm using `nvidia-driver-440-server` package, which is 440.82. Ubuntu 20.04 seems to add the choice between nvidia-driver-440 and nvidia-driver-440-server, not sure what the difference is or if that matters but only the latter is marked at \"tested\".\r\n\r\nCuriously, after I get this error in the docker container, `nvidia-smi` tends to become incredibly slow, taking 15+ seconds to report GPUs. I just noticed that both GPU Fan and Pwr now show `ERR!`. Thus, it seems like a hardware problem, or at least a driver problem. As such I think I've solved this issue's main problem, although the bugs in https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/837#issuecomment-669163281 are still valid.\r\n\r\nEdit: Ok, I have no idea what is going on. The fan/power ERR was a red herring. My best guess now is seems like there's something problematic about the latest nvidia-docker and old versions of CUDA, but curious if anyone else can reproduce issues with deeplabcut on Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\nEdit 2: it's a hardware problem! swapping out the 2070 RTX for a Titan RTX completely resolved the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/669607140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tbenst","id":863327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzMyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/863327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst","html_url":"https://github.com/tbenst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3626977505,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzYyNjk3NzUwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3626977505","actor":{"login":"tbenst","id":863327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzMyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/863327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst","html_url":"https://github.com/tbenst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbenst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-06T01:12:39Z","rename":{"from":"LossTensor
