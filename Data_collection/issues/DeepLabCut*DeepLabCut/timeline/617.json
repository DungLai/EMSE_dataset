The selection method depends on the arguments you pass to `extract_frames()` (for details see [function details](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#c-data-selection-extract-frames) ).\r\nSo any time you look into the labeled-data folder corresponding to a video, you will see that only a subset of frames are contained in the folders, these are the frames that you can label through the GUI and that will be fed to the network during training.\r\nI hope this makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/597784327/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hugofluhr","id":39996533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTk2NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39996533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr","html_url":"https://github.com/hugofluhr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugofluhr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3120151613,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMjAxNTE2MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3120151613","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T19:06:32Z","label":{"name":"howtousedlc","color":"a1b3f4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3120151763,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEyMDE1MTc2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3120151763","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-11T19:06:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
