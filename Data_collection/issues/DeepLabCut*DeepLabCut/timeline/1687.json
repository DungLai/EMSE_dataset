I'll try and summarise some of my findings from trying to get it to work here.\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\n\r\nA key part of getting tensorflow-directml to work is just to get it to recognise the GPU. Tested on older versions of tensorflow via:\r\n```python\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\nsess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))\r\n```\r\nTo get this to work, I changed the order of installation so that tensorflow-directml dependencies supersede the deeplabcut one. This allowed my integrated and dedicated GPU to be recognised.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when I tried to import deeplabcut I got an extremely large error traceback that ended in ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy.typing'. I assume this is because tensorflow-directml 1.15.5needs a version of numpy that doesn't have numpy.typing. I'll do more tests to see this can be solved with a numpy version that works with both deeplabcut and tensorflow 1.15.5. Below I have the error report, any advice will be appreciated!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: import deeplabcut as dlc\r\nDLC loaded in light mode; you cannot use any GUI (labeling, relabeling and standalone GUI)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-7dc21562c90f> in <module>\r\n----> 1 import deeplabcut as dlc\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     44\r\n     45\r\n---> 46 from deeplabcut.create_project import (\r\n     47     create_new_project,\r\n     48     create_new_project_3d,\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\create_project\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n      1 from deeplabcut.create_project.add import add_new_videos\r\n----> 2 from deeplabcut.create_project.demo_data import load_demo_data\r\n      3 from deeplabcut.create_project.modelzoo import (\r\n      4     create_pretrained_human_project,\r\n      5     create_pretrained_project,\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\create_project\\demo_data.py in <module>\r\n     13\r\n     14 import deeplabcut\r\n---> 15 from deeplabcut.utils import auxiliaryfunctions\r\n     16\r\n     17\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\utils\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n----> 1 from deeplabcut.utils.auxfun_multianimal import *\r\n      2 from deeplabcut.utils.auxfun_videos import *\r\n      3 from deeplabcut.utils.auxiliaryfunctions import *\r\n      4 from deeplabcut.utils.conversioncode import *\r\n      5 from deeplabcut.utils.frameselectiontools import *\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\utils\\auxfun_multianimal.py in <module>\r\n     19\r\n     20 from deeplabcut.utils import auxiliaryfunctions, conversioncode\r\n---> 21 from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset import trainingsetmanipulation\r\n     22\r\n     23\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\generate_training_dataset\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     10\r\n     11 from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.frame_extraction import *\r\n---> 12 from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.trainingsetmanipulation import *\r\n     13 from deeplabcut.generate_training_dataset.multiple_individuals_trainingsetmanipulation import *\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\generate_training_dataset\\trainingsetmanipulation.py in <module>\r\n     22 import yaml\r\n     23\r\n---> 24 from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_tensorflow import training\r\n     25 from deeplabcut.utils import (\r\n     26     auxiliaryfunctions,\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     10\r\n     11 from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_tensorflow.config import *\r\n---> 12 from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_tensorflow.datasets import *\r\n     13 from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_tensorflow.default_config import *\r\n     14 from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_tensorflow.core.evaluate import *\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\datasets\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n     11 from .pose_deterministic import DeterministicPoseDataset\r\n     12 from .pose_scalecrop import ScalecropPoseDataset\r\n---> 13 from .pose_imgaug import ImgaugPoseDataset\r\n     14 from .pose_tensorpack import TensorpackPoseDataset\r\n     15 from .pose_multianimal_imgaug import MAImgaugPoseDataset\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\datasets\\pose_imgaug.py in <module>\r\n     20 import pickle\r\n     21\r\n---> 22 import imgaug.augmenters as iaa\r\n     23 import numpy as np\r\n     24 import scipy.io as sio\r\n\r\n~\\anaconda3\\envs\\dlc_dml2\\lib\\site-packages\\imgaug\\__init__.py in <module>\r\n      5 #
