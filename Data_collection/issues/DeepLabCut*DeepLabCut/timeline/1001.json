Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nHi DeepLabCut!\r\n\r\nWe are having some issues when we run analyze videos on novel videos. \r\nWe are creating a new folder (novel_videos) within the videos folder of the DLC project (so permissions are fine). We are selecting a video and stating how many animals are present and asking to create a video and save results as a CSV. The code runs fine with no errors and videos show tracking throughout the video. All the progress bars shown by the python terminal reach 100%. However, the CSV's are 'giving up' towards the end of videos, showing no tracking at all for any individuals after x number of frames. The excel sheet shows the correct number of frames, but simply stops tracking after X number of frames. \r\n(Also please note for 1 video it has done this at the start, not the end of the video. with the first 2 seconds being completely blank, despite the animal being tracked in the video).\r\n\r\nI tried deleting and re-running but got the exact same issue, with it cutting off at the exact same spot.\r\nI have checked and the videos are not corrupt (using your fix in issue https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1001) \r\nI have lowered my p-cut off and the minimal number of connections. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea why the CSV's are dropping these numbers? \r\nAs always, thank you in advance for your help :)\n\n### Operating System\n\nwindows\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nv2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGPU (hp z book) \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Use GUI to open project\r\n2. Analyze videos tab\r\n3. Select a novel video and tell DLC there are 2 animals present \r\n4. Ask dlc to create video and CSV\r\n5. Code runs without issue \r\n6. Video tracks 'fine' (tracking can be bad for our very noisy data, however points still present across entire video) \r\n7.  Check CSV, 'cuts off' towards end of video giving no more data points\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nUsing snapshot-200000 for model C:\\Users\\cw266\\Videos\\ml_comparison_4-Charlotte-2022-03-11\\dlc-models\\iteration-0\\ml_comparison_4Mar11-trainset95shuffle1\r\nProcessing...
