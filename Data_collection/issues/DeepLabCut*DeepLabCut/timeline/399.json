need to adjust the ``cbrow`` and ``cbcol``. ``cbrow``  and ``cbcol`` represents the number of interior corners (i.e. the intersection of black and white boxes) in the checkerboard. e.g ``cbrow = 8`` and ``cbcol=6`` in our example notebook.\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/DEMO_3D_DeepLabCut.ipynb\r\nSo, in your case, it should be ``cbrow=3`` and ``cbcol=8``. \r\n\r\nThe view from below has some black spots, so it might cause some issues while detecting the corner points of the checkerboard, as corner detection algorithm of OpenCV is a bit sensitive to noise.\r\n\r\nHope it helps!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/521775994/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"meet10may","id":5408796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDg3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5408796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may","html_url":"https://github.com/meet10may","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meet10may/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/521802239","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/399#issuecomment-521802239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/399","id":521802239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTgwMjIzOQ==","user":{"login":"rattey","id":54152231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTUyMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54152231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey","html_url":"https://github.com/rattey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rattey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T21:21:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T21:21:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
