I am using the current version of the provided environment files. \n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nI am not able to `import deeplabcut` so I can't be sure. Might be a good idea to include a txt file that plainly lists the version?\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ncpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Install Anaconda\r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`\r\n3. `cd` into `conda-environments` folder and `conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml`\r\n4. `conda activate DEEPLABCUT`\r\n5. `ipython`\r\n6. `import deeplabcut`\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nIn [1]: import deeplabcut\r\n2021-09-22 11:17:58.256281: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'cudart64_110.dll';
