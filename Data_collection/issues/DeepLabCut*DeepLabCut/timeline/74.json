Our idea was to manually extract some of the frames where DLC made a mistake, mark them by hand, and re-train the network including those frames to the training sample. Is this a good strategy?\r\n\r\nYes, we think this is a good approach, as we discussed in our paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y)\r\n\r\n If yes, what steps need to be taken to manually add marked frames to the training sample? As I understood, currently the training frames are selected algorithmically, and their indices are probably stored in some temporary files, right?\r\n\r\nCorrect, you can at any stage of a project add additional folders with annotated frames and create a new training set. Then you can train your network. You might also want to start from a particular snapshot (to speed up training).\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, we will release code soon with outlier frame detection heuristics + relabeling GUIs (that allow the user to manually correct rare errors and refine the network). This work is currently under review and there are some beta-testers checking it out. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/427955504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1891144024,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg5MTE0NDAyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1891144024","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-08T19:41:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
