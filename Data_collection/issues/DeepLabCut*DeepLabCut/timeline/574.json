@AlexEMG \r\nI think I have a clue on why machine labeled (after selecting outliers) frames have wrong coordinates. \r\n\r\nThe machinelabel.h5 or .csv have the right coordinates, however, somehow, when it gets written in the collecteddata.h5/.csv the indexing are wrong, thus when viewing the frames, the labels have the coordinates of another frame, and also if the right frame doesn't have a body part, in the wrong frame it won't show the body part. \r\n\r\nA minimal working example would just be to select outlier frames, save 5 frames, run refine labels, there is where problems arise, if I am on the 2nd frame [1] and go back to the first [0], I can go back even more to -n frame.\r\nI tried to run it on my mac, and the same problem appeared. \r\nIs that more
