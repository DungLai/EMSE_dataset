deeplabcut team,\r\n\r\nFirst of all thank you for making this great program!  I am encountering some difficulties getting accurate tracking of the shape of a mouse's eyelid. I would like to get some help here. \r\n\r\nMy DLC environment: OS: Windows 10. GPU: NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3080   Cuda: 10.0 . & DLC-GPU environment file. Deeplabcut Version: 2.1.10.4\r\n\r\nI extracted and hand-labeled 90 frames using kmeans method. Then I created the trainingset using RESNET-50 (didn't change other parameters in pose yaml config file). I can normally run all the steps in the program. However, the training results are very poor. The train and test errors are over 200. And based on the inference coordinates, all the 6 markers are located on the corner of the image, which is far- far away from my hand-labeled coordinates.\r\n\r\nDescription of my video: mice are head-fixed so the lighting and position of all the labels are pretty similar across frames. I thought tracking this type of videos should be relatively  easy compared to a freely moving animal. But the results seem to be far from accurate. I am thinking that I'm missing some important step, but I couldn't figure it out. \r\n\r\nI have attached an example image of the video, the training results summary, hand-labeled coordinates, result coordinates, plus the 2 config files down below. Please let me know if other info is needed. Thank you again!!\r\n\r\n![manually labeled video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18105990/120143517-d42f4680-c212-11eb-9ad0-a92b7ee0f01b.PNG)\r\n![combined evaluation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18105990/120143522-d7c2cd80-c212-11eb-862a-77e0aab9dec4.PNG)\r\n![labeled coordinates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18105990/120143533-dabdbe00-c212-11eb-91f3-54b2c3a56a11.PNG)\r\n![results coordinate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18105990/120143543-dd201800-c212-11eb-83b2-feeb088b27af.PNG)\r\n\r\n[configfile.txt](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/6567928/configfile.txt)\r\n[pose_cfgfile.txt](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/6567929/pose_cfgfile.txt)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/879255079","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1142#issuecomment-879255079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1142","id":879255079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3OTI1NTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-13T17:06:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T17:07:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"NOTE: we now support 3090 and TensorFlow 2!
