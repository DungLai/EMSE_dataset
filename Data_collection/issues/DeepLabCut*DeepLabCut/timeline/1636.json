Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI believe I am having an issue that was previously addressed (#1636, #1647), related to moving projects with labeled frames to another computer. I have a project with about 400 labeled frames that I moved on to a computer with the GPU I want to use for training. When I attempt to create the training dataset, I get a 'TypeError'. Below is the full output. I also get an error when trying to view the labeled frames ('Label Frames' function), which is posted below as well. \r\n\r\nI've transferred projects between these same computers before and everything ran fine, so I'm not sure what is different.\n\n### Operating System\n\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\nDLC 2.2.0.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nNVIDIA Quadro P2000\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. On original computer- I ran 'Label frames' in GUI and labeled about 400 frames total\r\n2. The project was transferred to another computer (noted above) and the link was updated in the config file\r\n3. On the second computer- I ran: conda activate DLC-GPU\r\n4. In GUI: I ran 'Create training dataset' or 'Label frames'\r\n5. Relevant errors for either are copied below\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n(base) PS C:\\Users\\SNRC_Z42> conda activate DLC-GPU\r\n(DLC-GPU) PS C:\\Users\\SNRC_Z42> python -m deeplabcut\r\nStarting GUI...\r\n\r\n1.
