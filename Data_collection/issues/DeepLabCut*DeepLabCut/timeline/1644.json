again,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to let you know that retraining on the new version was generally good advice. I made a fresh project and copied in labeled data as instructed, and modified the new config. It also involved going through all labeled videos and essentially resaving, since the structure of the data has changed between the DLC version and the files could not be concatenated since they were incompatible when creating the training data set. Tracking does appear to be better now. \r\n\r\nHowever, the original issue I submitted about persists. Modifying the inference_cfg.yaml file for the current iteration (now 0 in the new project) has no impact on the tracklets. \r\n\r\nEdit: It seems that the only value within the inference_cfg.yaml that is being utilized/is required is _topktoretain_. Not sure if this will help with troubleshooting or not, but I thought I would share.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1021431510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1023269417","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1644#issuecomment-1023269417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1644","id":1023269417,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c48_dop","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T14:30:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T14:30:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Glad to hear tracking is improved!

In short, all 3 relevant tracking parameters work as I would expect.\r\n\r\n- `iou_overlap`: the higher it is, the larger the number of false negatives, MOTA drops, and tracking becomes very slow (e.g., with iou_overlap=1, there is no matching at all between a tracker and an animal, so trackers are being created/deleted in every frame, MOTA=0)\r\n- `max_age` (i.e., the maximal duration—in # of frames—a tracker can stay outdated before being deleted): if set to 0, tracking requires many more trackers overall and creates more fragments (tracking interruptions) than if set to 10 for example\r\n- `min_hits`: the higher it is, the higher the number of false negatives (similar to iou_overlap) with a very marked decrease in tracking accuracy (expectedly, as this is equivalent to filtering sporadic detections in favor of longer, high-quality tracklets). There is an exception though if `min_hits` is set to a number larger than the number of frames: this has no effect because of \r\nthe following line:\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/9ae1d47f437008fea42a41a7d97fb274398fd270/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/lib/trackingutils.py#L506\r\nwhere `self.n_frames <= self.min_hits` then always evaluates to True.\r\n\r\nReflecting back on what you describe though, and in particular \"labeling the grass or a tree instead of the animal\", prompts me to ask: have you tried to run `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections`? If tracklets are \"misplaced\", this has likely more to do with spurious (grouping of) detections than tracking, which only sees already assembled individuals. Another simple diagnosis tool is to reevaluate your network passing `deeplabcut.evaluate_network(..., plotting='individual'): this will create labeled images with detections colored by individuals, allowing you to judge how good your model is at reconstructing poses. I hope that helps! 😊

so much for looking into this for me. I really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nAfter a re-read of the documentation, I came across a little note within the animal assembly and tracking section:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45299786/152564213-306c8a11-1d1f-4283-8127-3c4db71f5369.png)\r\n\r\nI believe this is explaining why the inference_cfg.yaml has no impact in my situation. For my use case, I have a variety of videos, some multi animal, and some single animal. The number of monkeys varies quite a bit. For the project I am working on now, I am only tracking one animal, using a multi-animal project. The way tracking a single animal works now treats the project as a single animal project, which does not use the inference_cfg. This is definitely a new way to do it since I updated DLC last, since before, single animals were tracked using multi-animal methods.\r\n\r\nA quick follow up question: Are there any adjustable parameters besides p-cutoff (in config.yaml) that can be modified to influence single animal tracking within a multi-animal project? I have also been tinkering a bit with filtering methods, but only median filtering seems to work well for me in this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1030147247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1030650804","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1644#issuecomment-1030650804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1644","id":1030650804,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c49bnu0","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-05T16:05:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-05T16:05:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"indeed single animals should not be tracked in the same way, i.e., so this is changed (but since rc versions, which we note were subject to API changes :).
