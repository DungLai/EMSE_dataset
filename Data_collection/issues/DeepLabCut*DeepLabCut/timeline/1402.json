is an example of this. It is not a great example. Just using the windows clip tool on my computer changed what my eyes are seeing. In the GUI the blacks become a little blacker and the low contrast features become subtly more difficult to see. In the video, the tip of the octopuses mantle tip in this frame is easier for me to see than in the GUI. Please trust that there is a difference, any compression makes it more difficult to see. The worst difference is actually between cv2.imshow() during video recording and the deeplabcut GUI. \r\n\r\n![an_alteration_helps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86493327/125672538-3df054fa-54ed-437f-bad5-0442f5e026ca.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a example of how altering a low contrast image can help you see the low contrast features.

This means the network would not work on your original video then... if we don't save, the network can't be asked to really do this - if it's hard for a primate visual system, it's really hard for a

you can do image adjustments to help you find a body feature that means the information to find the feature is within the raw pixel values. NNs seem to be able to handle distorted images E.g., image augmentations can help when training a network. of course more easily seen by eye features will be easier for a NN but do we really know that NNs are not capable of learning low contrast body parts? Especially when other adjacent body parts are clearly visible. The models seem to handle occluded parts well enough. \r\n\r\nLow contrast bad is clearly transmitted in your publications. Unfortunately, data often is just what it is. Tools to help when data is dirty and/or you are using a low-quality screen could make labeling more pleasant. If the adjustment must be manual on every image people will only do it if they think it would help.  \r\n\r\nI do not agree that providing such a tool will lead humans down the dark path (ha! nice pun). I think reducing tool options along this line of thinking is wrong. Provide folks options, let us learn from our mistakes! Who knows maybe providing such tools can help folks come up with more easily described workflows for labeling blob-like objects (from personal experience, describing the method by which we label the edges of a soft-bodied organism is difficult. We have been trying to teach people and the error bars between humans are pretty astonishing). I do totally get not doing it along lines of it being a low priority. \r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI am happy to try hacking it! That GUI code base, to be honest, is pretty intimidating to someone not familiar with wxPython. I have wanted a goal-based reason to learn it for a while so this could be a good one. \r\n\r\nIs the ```labeling_toolbox.py``` a good place to start? Does ```def drawplot(self, img, img_name, itr, index, bodyparts, cmap, keep_view=False)``` initialize the image?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/880948639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weertman","id":86493327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDkzMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86493327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman","html_url":"https://github.com/weertman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weertman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/880987646","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1402#issuecomment-880987646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1402","id":880987646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDk4NzY0Ng==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-15T20:21:08Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T20:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You are welcome to disregard my advice as you like, and of course it's open source code, so please go ahead. 🤗 I was just offering my experience to you.
