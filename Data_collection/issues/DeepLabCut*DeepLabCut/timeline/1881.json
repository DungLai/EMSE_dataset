@netta-hub! The GUI looks flipped (i.e., all elements appear as if they were aligned right): is this due to recording or because of your language settings (like hebrew maybe)?\r\nFor a more modern feel and a smoother labeling experience though, I'd encourage you to look at our new labeling plugin: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/napari-deeplabcut\r\nIt's easy to install, and meant to slowly replace the current labeling GUI. It should work well in your case.
