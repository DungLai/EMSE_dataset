We hope that the DLC GUI provides the best of both worlds, i.e. zero programming experience is needed to use DLC and have access to state of the art pose estimation. For those wanting to learn more Python though, I recommend checking this out: http://DLCcourse.deeplabcut.org \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nMackenzie ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/717158271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3925248104,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkyNTI0ODEwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3925248104","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-27T10:54:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/717240769","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/970#issuecomment-717240769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/970","id":717240769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzI0MDc2OQ==","user":{"login":"nmtimme","id":38138179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38138179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme","html_url":"https://github.com/nmtimme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T13:24:46Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T13:24:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The deeplabcut GUI is very helpful, yes! While I managed to get it working without having to code in Python, it did take me about 15 hours to work through all the dependencies and issues surrounding which system I was running it on. So, I think it is important to remember that your code (which I greatly appreciate!) does come with a cost. It would be nice to offer users a different method of payment (i.e., paying money to Matlab). Furthermore, I think it would dramatically increase the number of users. Thank you again for all your hard work in producing this software!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/717240769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nmtimme","id":38138179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM4MTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38138179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme","html_url":"https://github.com/nmtimme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmtimme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
