Thanks for your answer. \r\nIs that actually so different also from DLC perspective? We`ve been not sure because often the only difference is the antenna with cables on one mouse.\r\n\r\nIdentity was True before Training.\r\nIt seems now more stable and first looked great in one example video.\r\nBut still the problem is, that with some videos the identity is swapped from the begining on and then stable in that wrong labeling, as you can see:\r\n \r\nMulti DLC (Shuffle 2 -- after Training 1 with 40 Labeledframes + Training 2 with Refinement and 20 Outlierframes added)\r\nImportant!! Actually the mouse with the Antenna and Cables should be red, and the other one violet.. \r\nIt seems like its still random, which identity is picked.\r\nWould recommend to do more refinements? Would take a loong time without lasso swapping.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81317771/142791999-36e4a7bd-c1ea-465f-967a-55787ccae410.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIve also tried to use standard DLC:\r\n(Shuffle 2 -- after Training 1 with 20 Labeledframes + Training 2 with 20 Outlierframes

the tracker method: we havent found yet a really detailled explanation, which of \"sk\"/ \"bx\"/ \"el\" works best..\r\n\r\nCheers :)
