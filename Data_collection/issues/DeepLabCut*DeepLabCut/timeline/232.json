You can see what videos the project currently knows to look for by looking at \"_video_sets_\" in your config.yaml. If this is a video you have labeled and trained on previously, and you are just adding **more** frames, you should be fine. If it is new, I *think* that if you want for the **train_network** function to recognize that labeled data, you need to use\r\n> deeplabcut.add_new_videos(\"Full path of config.yaml\",[\"full path of video \"], copy_videos=True/False)\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware the outlier frames *do get extracted* even if you did not add the video to the project ahead of time, so you do not need to re-run the extract_outlier_frames function. You can double-check this by going into the project folder, looking in \"_labeled-data_\", and seeing if there is a \"_machine labels_\" file with the same iteration number as you're currently using. I think this is called \"_iter_\" in the config file (it will be 0 when you start).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/469906374/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oliriley","id":12940380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQwMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12940380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley","html_url":"https://github.com/oliriley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliriley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/470267317","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/232#issuecomment-470267317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/232","id":470267317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDI2NzMxNw==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T20:39:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T20:40:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Videos that contain training data should be added to the list of videosets so that they are included in the training set.
