So, while it's easier for our visual system if you have low quality videos to label to use the time information, the \"best practice\" is to record videos with more resolution  or higher frame rate (if blur is an issue for you). If you can't do that, then I suggest opening the video in Fiji as the frame # at the top will be the same frame # in the GUI for labeling...
