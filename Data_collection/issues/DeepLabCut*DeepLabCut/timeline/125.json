So what you want to do is save the scoremaps, then threshold (find multiple peaks) them to find multiple labels. As we mentioned issue #84 ... and some of this was discussed in the slack group, since it’s not a bug so we like to keep development discussions on slack (anyone is open to join). \r\n\r\nhere is the script that will save the scoremaps when you analyze the videos. https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/1.11/Analysis-tools/AnalyzeVideosAndExtractScoreMaps.py\r\n\r\n(at this stage you need to use DLC 1.1 for this)\r\n\r\nBut we don’t have a plan to push code for this right now... as this is a feature request I’ll close the issue, but feel free to join slack to discuss developments. \r\n\r\nHope that helps!
