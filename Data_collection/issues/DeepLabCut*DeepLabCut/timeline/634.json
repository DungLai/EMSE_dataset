The y-scale (FPS) for the 512x512 image says ~0.5-0.75FPS x batch size of 32-64 per batch would give about ~25FPS overall.  I'm now getting about ~20FPS for 1280x1024 videos on a Titan Xp, so I guess that's good relative these figures.\r\n\r\nMy main concern was whether I was doing something wrong - and that doesn't seem to be the case.  So thanks for clarifying that and for the links.\r\n\r\nBtw: the videos contain multiple animals and I wonder whether resnet101 would be faster on these?  Do you have any recommendations on speed using resnet101?\r\n\r\nThanks so much\r\n\r\n[EDIT:] Actually, my mistake - I think I misread the information and relied on the CPU speed chart (and also misinterpreted the graphs). The GPU speed for 1080Ti I see it now, says ~60FPS for larger batches of 554 video;  So for 1280x1024 videos I think 20-25FPS (what I am getting) seems also in line with your tests.
