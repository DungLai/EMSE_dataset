Thank you. I thought that I had all of those versions sorted out after following https://www.pytorials.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-gpu-with-cuda-10-0-for-python-on-windows/\r\nBut I will work on that to try to figure out why my CUDA went from 10.0 to 10.2\r\n\r\nI had already written the following when I saw your recent comment about CUDA and about batch size: Your most recent comment makes sense in light of what I had found/tried below (changing global_scale and batchsize parameters is A LOT more informed than what I tried below and I will try that now on my project going back to witholding cropping as I had originally -- but I think I don´t understand the impact of the training set cropping properly as per my question below):\r\n\r\n_______what I had written while you posted the two comments above____\r\nA little progress (followed by a question).\r\nI found this post: https://github.com/google/seq2seq/issues/301\r\nIt sounded like the same issue arose from a memory issue in this person´s case, which made me realize that I had denied cropping option in the create training set step. I went back to the GUI and did the create training set step again, this time with default cropping. This time the training seems to be progressing through iterations (it is up to iteration 1000 now). So I guess that was my issue.\r\n\r\nWhich leads to my question (which is probably really naive). From what I could tell in my initial exploration, the cropped frames option in the training set creation leads to a bunch of images with nothing in them and many with only partial views of a single animal. How are whole animal skeletons recognized/learned (and multianimals) learned if they are never in the same image at the same time? How does the training on the cropped frames work if the cropped frames don´t contain whole images of each animal (let alone different animals together)?\r\nDoes that question make sense? I obviously don´t understand the machine learning backend and want to make sure that this is expected behavior and that I am not doing something wrong with the cropping parameters or original video files. \r\n\r\nRE error2 with testscript.py:\r\nsince the error occurred during tests with ResNet50 I would think this would come up with the multianimal training that I now have running from the GUI (though it has not yet). I will keep you posted. Let me know if there are further troubleshooting steps I should take for that testscript.py error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/655769222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"neurologic","id":4777333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzczMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4777333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic","html_url":"https://github.com/neurologic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neurologic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/655774415","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/791#issuecomment-655774415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/791","id":655774415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTc3NDQxNQ==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T21:45:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T21:45:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All good Q's \r\n\r\nfirst, the testscript.py actually might not be working with 2.2beta yet;
