You have partial squares all around. Even a very thin border can help\r\n\r\n![](https://docs.opencv.org/master/calib_result.jpg)\r\n\r\nbut I find that a border as thick as the squares themselves provides the cleanest output.  You also have to make sure you are inputing parameters correctly - i.e. how many rows and columns you declare. For your image it looks like 9 and 6. If rows=6 and cols=9 doesn't work, try rows=9 and cols=6. Sometimes what you call a row vs a column is nonsensical.\r\n\r\nI believe DLC uses the [opencv camera calibration](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html) engine, which I have never used for 3D, so you would have to look there for placement and orientation of origin and axis, but most algorithms use either:\r\n\r\n1. the center of the calibration point cloud in all frames,\r\n2. the first frame digitized in the first camera\r\n3. or the center of the first camera's sensor and its orientation (principal point). \r\n \r\nI'm pretty sure that opencv uses 3 based on a pinhole model. But none of those are very helpful for registering axes among different camera placements. The best strategy for what you want is to have a fixed or temporary registration object to provide axis origin and orientation. Build a physical object like:\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aHe4R.png)\r\n\r\nYou can setup the cameras, place the calibration object, and film a single frame of it (or leave it in view during the animal trials). If your filming volume is inside of a box, and one box corner is visible in both cameras, you can use that as your origin and box edges as axes. If you always place the object in the same global location and orientation, and digitize it for every camera set up, you can translate and rotate your DLC calculated animal coordinates to that global reference frame.\r\n\r\nThere are other DLC compatible systems that are more focussed on 3d. I've used anipose, and helped develop easyWand and Argus. If you need very precise 3D tracking, look at those options (and the DLC cheetah paper).\r\n\r\nIf you need [future help on usage strategies](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut#community-support-developers--help), it's best to ask on the image.sc forum and save GitHub issues for bug reports. \r\n\r\nAlso, the developers are busy with their own research programs and lives, but do their best to develop and support free software. Some of us are just experienced DLC users (with our own busy research programs and lives) who try to help other users. We enjoy helping, but please show patience when requesting help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/863990145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4931014650,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDkzMTAxNDY1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4931014650","actor":{"login":"jonahpc","id":27032080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDMyMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27032080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc","html_url":"https://github.com/jonahpc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonahpc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-23T20:25:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
