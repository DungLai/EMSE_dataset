https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsa8R5J0nQ&ab_channel=DeepLabCut\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating and cross-validating the network, analyzing the videos, and converting to tracklets, I went to Refine Tracklets and launched the GUI. On the GUI, there were no markers, and I could not click/select anything. Hitting Save generated an h5 file where the (x, y, likelihood) values were all NaN.\r\n\r\nI do not get an error message.\r\n\r\nThe generated file cat2DLC_resnet50_CatOct5shuffle1_2000_full.mp4 contains markers so it seems like some tracking was successful.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nRefine Tracklets view.
