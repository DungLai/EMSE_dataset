The code to evaluate MOTA isn't part of the public-facing API; it requires human-annotated videos to evaluate how well animals are tracked, which is a very rare use-case. However, mAP is automatically calculated after network evaluation.\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/ac547cbcdd4f5109b711875b481c1ac86222987c/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/core/evaluate_multianimal.py#L558\r\nYou will need to update DLC though, as it was only formally added after RC3.\r\nYou could call `cross_validate_paf_graphs()` separately too: the only thing you need is to pass your project config, the inference config found under dlc-models/test/inf_config.yaml, and the _full and _meta.pickle that are in the evaluation-results folder. Multiple graphs of increasing size will be evaluated, and mAP for each one will be written to a _map.pickle file. If you'd like lower level access, it is just a bit more complicated: have a look at these two functions https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/ac547cbcdd4f5109b711875b481c1ac86222987c/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/lib/crossvalutils.py#L254\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/ac547cbcdd4f5109b711875b481c1ac86222987c/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/lib/inferenceutils.py#L955\r\nThe latter is to convert your annotated data (typically the CollectedData.h5 in training-datasets) into assemblies, which are then passed to `evaluate_assembly`. I hope this helps
