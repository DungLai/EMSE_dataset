Description**\r\nDirect reference to my recent response to #1413 (reposting as a separate issue because #1413 was closed). When I run testscript.py, as described in the tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s) immediately after installing DLC and then activating the conda environment, the execution of the program seems to throw multiple exceptions and errors which do not appear in the video. A lot of the data and messages about training the network also do not appear for me.
