Dear Alexander@AlexEMG, \r\nThank you for reply. \r\nI am not fully understand what you mean by 'changing it in different shuffle'. \r\nDo you mean that \r\nFirst, i change  '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckp' in the original pose_cfg file to 'init_weights: /content/drive/My Drive/shauyin/dlc-models/iteration-0/#203Nov28-trainset95shuffle1/train/snapshot-44500'. \r\nThen i restart the initial step as '\r\nfrom google.colab import drive\r\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')' ? \r\nor which step should i start after i change the pose_cfg file. \r\n\r\nI mean if i restart from the first step, it later still will produce ''/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt' in the pose_cfg file, then re-training is almost start from zero, rather than on the basis the the last check_point of the training. \r\nCan you please tell me from which step i should follow to make pose_cfg file after being edited  works? \r\nCheers,

If i understand correctly, does it mean that i put the pose_cfg file with the init_weights changed into this directory and then restart the training? \r\nIf i understan correctly for that, then it comes to another question, i can find the directory ' /usr/local/lib/python3.6', but i can not further find the ' /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt'. Can you please help me to figure out what the problem would be?\r\nThanks in advance, \r\nShauyin\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-12 16-32-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40397232/70725895-7ac11800-1cfd-11ea-808f-db95c01341c7.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/565060757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiuxian620","id":40397232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk3MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40397232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620","html_url":"https://github.com/xiuxian620","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2878392352,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg3ODM5MjM1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2878392352","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-12T15:42:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2878392355,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NzgzOTIzNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2878392355","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-12T15:42:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
