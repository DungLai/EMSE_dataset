These should/can be generic (e.g. mouse1, mouse2, etc.). These individuals are comprised of the same bodyparts defined by multianimalbodyparts. For annotation in the GUI and training, it is important that all individuals in each frame are labeled. Thus, keep in mind that you need to set individuals to the maximum number in your labeled-data set, .i.e., if there is (even just one frame) with 17 animals then the list should be - indv1 to - indv17. Note, once trained if you have a video with more or less animals, that is fine - you can have more or less animals during video analysis!_\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/894303533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5123248457,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTEyMzI0ODQ1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5123248457","actor":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-06T14:33:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5123248460,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxMjMyNDg0NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5123248460","actor":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-06T14:33:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/894315793","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1451#issuecomment-894315793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1451","id":894315793,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c41Ti0R","user":{"login":"CalvinLloyd117","id":45299786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinLloyd117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinLloyd117/received_events","ty

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nHi, \r\n\r\nI had trained my multianimal network successfully, but when I evaluate it on GUI, it showed ：“ ValueError : Shape of passed value is (40, 10), indices imply (40, 15)\".  I started to learn Deeplabcut a few days ago. I had trained a single-animal model without this bug. So I wonder whether it was due to the multianimal mode.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, there is another bothering question. Could I continue to work with the network, if training process was accidentally killed? Actually, I had trained a previous model but it stopped at iteration 75000 out of unknown reason. I tried to reload the project and go evaluation, but got the same \"ValueError\" bug. I thought that was caused by the training interruption, so I copied the files and did trained again. This time training completed, but the error was still there.   \r\n\r\nI'm fledgling in deeplabcut and I used mostly default settings. \r\n\r\nMany thanks！\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndeeplabcut 2.2.1.1 GUI\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGPU NVIDIA Quadro P1000\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. launch DeepLabCut GUI\r\n2. everything samed ok till training completed \r\n3. run: evaluate network\r\n4. boom!\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nFile ~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\gui\\evaluate_network.py:270, in Evaluate_network.evaluate_network(self, event)\r\n    268 if len(self.bodyparts) == 0:\r\n    269     self.bodyparts = \"all\"\r\n--> 270 deeplabcut.evaluate_network(\r\n    271     self.config,\r\n    272     Shuffles=Shuffles,\r\n    273     #trainingsetindex=trainingsetindex,\r\n    274     plotting=plotting,\r\n    275     show_errors=True,\r\n    276     comparisonbodyparts=self.bodyparts,\r\n    277 )\r\n\r\nFile ~\\anaconda3\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\core\\evaluate.py:601, in evaluate_network(config, Shuffles, trainingsetindex, plotting, show_errors, comparisonbodyparts, gputouse, rescale, modelprefix)\r\n    598     from .evaluate_multianimal import evaluate_multianimal_full\r\n    600     #
