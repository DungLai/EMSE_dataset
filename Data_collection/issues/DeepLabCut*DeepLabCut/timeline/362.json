You input individual frames that you labeled, not videos. So, \"20 sec video\" doesn't mean anything to me. Also, as we say in multiple places, the size of your network scales with the size of your frames. Thus, if you have large frames, training will take longer. \r\n\r\nThere is a timing section in the protocol paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0176-0#Sec36\r\n\r\n> The time required to train the network (Stage VII) mainly depends on the frame size of the dataset and the computer hardware. On an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, it takes 4 h to train the network for 200,000 iterations (640 × 480 pixels). On a CPU, it will take several days to train for the same number of iterations on the same dataset.\r\n\r\n> Step 9, Stage VII, training the network: ~1–12 h (~6 h on a 1080-Ti GPU, and dependent on frame size)\r\n\r\nYou don't report how many iterations you ran, but 12hrs seems the appropriate amount of time given your frame size of 640x480. \r\n\r\nSeems you are indeed using up all the memory in your GPU card (the task manager is likely just reporting the GPU for your monitor, nvidia-smi is showing you the use of the card for python3): \r\n\r\n> But the dedicated GPU memory was about 7.2/8.0 GB, and this contrast seemed weird to us.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, of course a simple autoencoder is not a comparable speed to a ResNet-50.... \r\n\r\n\r\n>Additional context\r\nWe ran a simple autoencoder that uses keras and its training was super fast with GPU.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to not be making new models all the time, but building a robust network that you can use for video analysis, so a 1 or 2 time 12-hr run seems acceptable. Increasing batchsize > 1 is not supported in training at this time (yet this may change in a future release). \r\n\r\nYou may consider looking at other benchmarks:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/guide/performance/benchmarks\r\nhttps://lambdalabs.com/blog/2080-ti-deep-learning-benchmarks/\r\n\r\nBut, a 2070 is generally not very fast.

We are complete amateurs with these kinds of things, so we apologize for not being knowledgeable enough.\n\nIf we understood correctly, it seems then that the first few times of training the network are supposed to take very long, but as we keep refining it to improve analysis performance, the training time should gradually decrease; so the situation we described is to be expected.\n\nIs the log.txt file attached below what you were referring to? If so, we took this from our first time training the network (iteration-0, under the \"train\" folder):\nlog.txt<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_AlexEMG_DeepLabCut_files_3403727_log.txt&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=1T3tfEiFGe8s3XfVuH5J_XVRpJ48QFn7pZBZ2CAPxPM&s=26iDygJaus0A4fsvhC8Ts9Uom2ADMVNW54yhQuG8vs0&e=>\n\nWe started retraining the network (ongoing as of now) after augmenting the training dataset with extracted outlier frames from a new but similar type of video, and here is the NVIDIA-SMI output:\n\n[NVIDIA_SMI_Screenshot]<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__user-2Dimages.githubusercontent.com_50585879_61409231-2Dca66f900-2Da8af-2D11e9-2D89ea-2Dc0009036885c.png&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=1T3tfEiFGe8s3XfVuH5J_XVRpJ48QFn7pZBZ2CAPxPM&s=R7pqBedOYDN-yXWFtLaUYlPQ9yap6ppPsXQnW3iXA3I&e=>\n\nAnd we now understand that we can terminate the training after 50-200K iterations as the loss plateaus, thank you for the suggestion. That should cut back the training time significantly. We might also try downsampling our videos to make the frame size smaller.\n\nAgain, thank you very much!\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it

Train the network\n\nThank you!\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_AlexEMG_DeepLabCut_issues_362-3Femail-5Fsource-3Dnotifications-26email-5Ftoken-3DAE7CMXSIZKSPECZ5R7OKW3TQADFP3A5CNFSM4IECMHN2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOD2JU7RQ-23issuecomment-2D512970694&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=2BzJmpNp4t-gWJ2IymhnDO_Wmy2sFZRORM0pxXssH2o&s=T_-D9pDgUAV-8Q53R0JVjWTEh7qnHrSOZnfHuiMRrrY&e=>, or mute the thread<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_notifications_unsubscribe-2Dauth_AE7CMXR6KKBYTIRQPLCMWKTQADFP3ANCNFSM4IECMHNQ&d=DwMCaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=11wEEDBv3Ke3n3b8dICjuQC5vgZ23dfGPax018VOZ2g&m=2BzJmpNp4t-gWJ2IymhnDO_Wmy2sFZRORM0pxXssH2o&s=3IYIN8zozsXwf2AXGKqvh4hImM1r5XqAtXUrbSuwmD8&e=>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/512991206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/513261057","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/362#issuecomment-513261057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/362","id":513261057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzI2MTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"donglabimaging","id":50585879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTg1ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50585879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging","html_url":"https://github.com/donglabimaging","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/donglabimaging/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T14:55:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T14:55:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much for helping us, we really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n(And we don't know why but we were getting the \"AUTOMATIC ADDING OF VIDEO TO CONFIG FILE FAILED!
