This is why we recommend using an Anaconda environment/ virtual environments, to not break packages. We already supply pre-installed environments, so it’s very easy to install, and for Linux we supply a Docker container. Please see the installation guide for more tips, thanks. \r\n\r\nAlso I don’t know if it will be straightforward to add as a plug-in for ImagePy, as the backend code is in TensorFlow (so it’s not pure Python), but happy to watch your progress.
