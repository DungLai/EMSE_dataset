for opening this issue, and thanks for using DeepLabCut (we hope you are enjoying it ;). \r\nPlease fill out the template completely, including the full \"TRACEBACK\" and input code that you ran to hit this error.\r\n\r\nI occasionally find that when I run deeplabcut.extract_frames or deeplabcut.label_frames, I get some 'failed to load module' errors.\r\n\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is. \r\nPlease provide the minimal required code to reproduce the error and the full output (please edit ONLY the section below that says `PLACE YOUR CODE HERE!!! `.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):**\r\n- OS: [Linux Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS]\r\n - DeepLabCut Version : 2.1.10\r\n - DeepLabCut mode : single animal tracking\r\n - -iPython\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:\r\n1. the input code you used -\r\ndeeplabcut.extract_frames(configPath,mode='automatic',algo='kmeans',crop='GUI')\r\ndeeplabcut.label_frames(configPath)\r\n\r\n4.

However, this doesn't happen every time I run this code .. sometimes the errors don't appear and I can continue as usual. \r\n\r\nA similar issue happens when I run label_frames\r\ndeeplabcut.label_frames(configPath)\r\nWhere in addition to the module load errors, I get a long list of repeating critical and warning errors:\r\n(ipython:24632):
