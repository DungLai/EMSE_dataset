Thank you!\r\n\r\nWell, the plots for one, show that there is a lot of missing detections of some bodyparts (which is actually a low likelihood detection but in reality the label would be nowhere near where it should be). Do bodyparts disappear a lot - meaning they are not visible to you? If yes, then this is both good and bad news - depends on your use case.  Since the angles are big, I'd go for closer to 100 labeled frames per camera angle (at least, realisticaly more like 150 per video). Not knowing how your videos really look and without knowing the whole use case the best advice I can give is to label far more frames and retrain the model (you can extract outliers and refine those to expand the dataset). Lastly I wouldn't use the same label for the back and abdomen. \r\n\r\nAfter retraining the plots should get a little bit better but if you have too many oclussions they will not change that much. If you need to have the detections every frame cause you're modelling something/doing 3D reconstruction using the pose estimation then interpolation and/or some form of spatiotemporal constrained filtering is probably your best bet since using data with missing values will not work.\r\n\r\nSo, first thing, label more and retrain the model and check it's performance again. Make the plots, maybe create labeled video for each camera angle to visually inspect the performance and get an idea what's going on.

Not knowing how your videos really look and without knowing the whole use case the best advice I can give is to label far more frames and retrain the model (you can extract outliers and refine those to expand the dataset). Lastly I wouldn't use the same label for the back and abdomen.\r\n> \r\n> After retraining the plots should get a little bit better but if you have too many oclussions they will not change that much. If you need to have the detections every frame cause you're modelling something/doing 3D reconstruction using the pose estimation then interpolation and/or some form of spatiotemporal constrained filtering is probably your best bet since using data with missing values will not work.\r\n> \r\n> So, first thing, label more and retrain the model and check it's performance again. Make the plots, maybe create labeled video for each camera angle to visually inspect the performance and get an idea what's going on.\r\n\r\nYes, your guess is correct. There are many occlusion problems in my video, and the extracted frames also have motion blur, so there is inaccuracy when manually labeling. But because my purpose is to perform 3D tracking and there are space limitations, I have to set up four cameras with different orientations. For example, in the video taken by the front camera, the back half of the animal will be completely blocked.\r\n\r\nWhat I am most uncertain of is, for example, when I label the elbow, there are multiple sides of the elbow in the actual video. Should I label the back, side and front of the elbow with the same label? This problem is similar to the back and the abdomen, but it is very different, because the back and the abdomen are the front and back, but the elbow is a 360-degree part.\r\n\r\nYes, I am trying to refine label and extract outlier label, hoping to improve. But is the quality of the video itself, perhaps the cause that most affects network performance?\r\n\r\nFor occlusion and motion blur, do you have any suggestions for improvement?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/782527972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZiyiZhang0912","id":62039483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDM5NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62039483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyiZhang0912","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/782602942","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107#issuecomment-782602942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107","id":782602942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjYwMjk0Mg==","user":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-20T10:32:45Z","updated_at":"2021-02-20T10:33:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe some advice on 3D reconstruction, it will answer your question and maybe help your implementation:\r\n\r\n1.

I have learned how to adjust the shutter speed to correct motion blur. But for my experimental site, lighting is also something to be concerned about. I am working on this, and the experimental environment for 3D tracking is still under construction.\r\n\r\nAt present, I can only try to find the optimal strategy by using videos that are not ideal. This is the evaluation result I got after refine_label on one of the videos:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"563\" alt=\"76ccd9589e14513cf4b2ec9b1bff8d2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/108807548-b8971d00-75df-11eb-8acc-c958235ea6a1.png\">\r\n\r\n![hist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/108808466-ae761e00-75e1-11eb-832d-04fc248bf06b.png)\r\n![plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/108808478-b0d87800-75e1-11eb-8bf0-de9842fb6692.png)\r\n![plot-likelihood](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62039483/108808483-b209a500-75e1-11eb-9b13-7993ac135059.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough the test error is very small, it is even similar to the train error. However, the actual network performance is still not good, with only a slight improvement compared to before. I don’t understand why the test error has reached an acceptable value, but I still don’t get an acceptable network?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am tracking a monkey. Tracking its limbs seems to be a big problem. In the tracking videos I got, the network often loses tracking of the limbs or confuses the left and right feet. This is also a problem I am facing that I hope to be optimized.\r\n\r\nRegarding the interpolation of missing content you mentioned earlier, can you briefly talk about how I would do it?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help! Thank you for your patience for a beginner！\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/783941439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ZiyiZhang0912","id":62039483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDM5NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62039483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyiZhang0912","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyiZhang0912/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/784025252","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107#issuecomment-784025252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1107","id":784025252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDAyNTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-23T09:14:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T09:14:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi Both, I'd ask we move this to the forum (https://forum.image.sc/tag/deeplabcut) , as this is not a git-hub issue; i.e. DLC is working. @ZiyiZhang0912 -- the plots above do show likely good tracking.
