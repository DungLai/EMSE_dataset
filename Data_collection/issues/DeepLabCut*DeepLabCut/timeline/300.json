Alex. Thanks for the prompt response. I am in linux + conda, and here's what worked:\r\n\r\n1.  I chose the 'import from cloned directory option' and that gave me a weird libculbas.so.10.0 error\r\n`ImportError: libcublas.so.10.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n`\r\nSo that seemed to be related to an assumption that I have cuda toolkit 10 (which I don't on this workstation; and not sure it would work with older GPU).  So downgraded tensorflow-gpu to 1.12 to work with cudatoolkit 9.0 (NVIDIA 384.xx) and after manually installing all the missing packages, I was able to import deeplabcut directly through command-line python from the root directory of the cloned github dlc directory.  So thanks for the help with that.\r\n\r\n2.  I also started the docker option, but I noticed that it uses some older tensorflow libraries and other older packages.  Perhaps if all else fails, I could return to that.\r\n\r\n3.  Pip installing dlc is probalby still an option, my guess is that I need a more up-to-date cuda toolkit (and maybe a newer GPU!?).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/497193149/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2377022177,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM3NzAyMjE3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2377022177","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-30T03:57:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
