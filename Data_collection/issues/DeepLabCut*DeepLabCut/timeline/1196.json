Brandon Jackson,\n\nI have currently run a new data set all made within the 2.rc2.1 update\n(labelled all the frames again (200 should in general be enough right?),\ncreated dataset etc) with your proposed batch size but instead with 10.000\niterations to test whether the message regarding 'skipping cancelled\nenqueue attempt with queue not closed' and the following 'Caused by op\n'fifo_queue_enqueue', defined at...' would persist as previously mentioned.\nThis occurred again but the program appears to work, but the quality was\nnot as high at 10.000 (as expected, I will give an update and video once I\nhave trained it at higher iterations because I feel like this problem might\npersist), so is this 'error' that will affect my results or is this just\nthe newest update message stating that it's done with training?\n\nFurthermore, I was wondering if your team is going to do a little\nvideo/blog post on the new settings availability in the refine tracklet and\nanalyze video tabs, I observed various parameters regarding switching etc\nwhich would be quite useful to have more information about the way it\naffects the network.\n\nAlso, it appears that new labeled frames made in the newest update version\ndo not require easydict, while the network I trained before the update\ncannot be evaluated without easydict, do you know what happens there?\n\nKind regards,\n\nCastielFracs\n\n\n\nOp di 1 jun. 2021 om 16:38 schreef Brandon Jackson ***@***.***\n>:\n\n> @CastielFracs <https://github.com/CastielFracs> , yes the 200k iteration\n> limit was set in a
