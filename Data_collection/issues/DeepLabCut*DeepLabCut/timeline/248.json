I'm not sure if when I upload the video into my drive if Google compresses it down. Why I ask is because I had run into an earlier problem with video compression at the extract_frames stage. The video I was trying to load had a compression format of SMB8 and kept returning an error. I used a separate software to uncompress the videos and then was able to extract the frames, when I was doing this I found that .avi files with compression type CRAM and MJPG also worked. \r\n\r\nI recreated an example of the error below:\r\n\r\nuncompressed file (type used in current run that will not create a file during analyze videos):\r\n![Capture - uncompressed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38668004/55432209-eee4d280-5557-11e9-892a-5bba7d4964d0.PNG)\r\n\r\nSMB8 file (original):\r\n![Capture SMB8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38668004/55432216-f1dfc300-5557-11e9-87d0-0318fb0dff3c.PNG)\r\n\r\nSMB8 test project was created using the uncompressed video.\r\nSMB8 test2 project was created using the SMB8 compressed video.\r\n \r\n![Capture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38668004/55432554-c4dfe000-5558-11e9-98e0-d28b6299d49a.PNG)\r\n\r\nWhen I made a call to extract_frames using the project with the SMB8 compressed video it appears as though no video is there with the error \"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'keys'\" being thrown and no frames being extracted.
