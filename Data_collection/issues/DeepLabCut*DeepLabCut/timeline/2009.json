@jeylau, I seemingly am having the same issue (After following the suggestion in #2118 to only use the DLC conda environment with deeplabcut[tf,gui], although I changed the name to DEEPLABCUT-test to avoid conflicts).\r\nI run:\r\n```\r\nconda env create -f DEEPLABCUT-test.yaml\r\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT-test\r\npython -m deeplabcut\r\n```\r\nand it crashes here. I've tried the following as suggested previously in this issue, which doesn't change the error:\r\n```\r\npip uninstall opencv-python\r\npip install opencv-python-headless\r\n```\r\nI have also tried the suggestions [here](https://forum.qt.io/topic/111553/solved-qt-qpa-plugin-could-not-find-the-qt-platform-plugin-xcb-in/2) to no avail. \r\n\r\nI'm running this on Ubuntu 20.04 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 GPU and CUDA 11.4\r\nWhile I can continue using DLC <2.3 I was hoping to incorporate the bug fix from #2036.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!\r\n<details><summary><h4>The log output</h4></summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqeglfs.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqminimal.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqminimalegl.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqoffscreen.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqvnc.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqwebgl.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.core.plugin.loader: In /home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/plugins/platforms/libqxcb.so:\r\n  Plugin uses incompatible Qt library (5.15.0) [release]\r\nqt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\" in \"/home/dgramling/anaconda3/envs/DEEPLABCUT-test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cv2/qt/plugins\"\r\nThis application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.
