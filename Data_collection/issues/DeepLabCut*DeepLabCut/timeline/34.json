There are many methods for behavioral classification as reviewed, e.g., in this [excellent recent article](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-018-0494-7). For many behaviors the output of DLC should be very efficient for classifying simple (kinematic) behaviors without much hassle (e.g. turning, rearing, etc). That said, it would be great to interface with some of the open source software for behavioral classification out there.
