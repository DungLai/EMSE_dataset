not sure we have a back up for the 3d.h5 ....  but you could try running `deeplabcut.analyze_videos_converth5_to_csv`\r\n\r\notherwise, you can just delete only the 3d.h5 and it's very fast to re-compute (~ secs)\r\n```\r\nSignature: deeplabcut.analyze_videos_converth5_to_csv(videopath, videotype='.avi')\r\nDocstring:\r\n    By default the output poses (when running analyze_videos) are stored as MultiIndex Pandas Array, which contains the name of the network, body part name, (x, y) label position \r\n\r\n    in pixels, and the likelihood for each frame per body part. These arrays are stored in an efficient Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) \r\n\r\n    in the same directory, where the video is stored. If the flag save_as_csv is set to True, the data is also exported as comma-separated value file. However,\r\n    if the flag was *not* set, then this function allows the conversion of all h5 files to csv files (without having to analyze the videos again)!\r\n    \r\n    This functions converts hdf (h5) files to the comma-separated values format (.csv), which in turn can be imported in many programs, such as MATLAB, R, Prism, etc.\r\n    \r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    \r\n    videopath : string\r\n        A strings containing the full paths to videos for analysis or a path to the directory where all the videos with same extension are stored.\r\n\r\n    videotype: string, optional\r\n        Checks for the extension of the video in case the input to the video is a directory.\r\nOnly videos with this extension are analyzed.
