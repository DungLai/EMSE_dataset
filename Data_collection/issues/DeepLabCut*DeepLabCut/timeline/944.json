am currently trying with the dev branch and I was able to start training. However, it was far from ideal. First, I learned that TF2.2 does not work with CUDA 11 (let alone 11.1), so it won't recognize the GPU. So, I had to install  CUDA 10.1 which is supposed to be the version that works with TF2.2. That change made the system to recognize the GPU. Then, training took a long time to start but it engaged the GPU as seen in Task manager. A warning message was shown about PTX compiling been done by the driver (I cannot find the original message in the training log), after which training started but it was very slow. Also, the reduction of the \"loss\" value after each iteration seems smaller than I remembered, but I have no objective way to confirm this. In any case, I was able to train for 10000 iterations which is a good progress. \r\n\r\nI think one possible solution is to compile TF2.2 or 2.3 with CUDA 11.1 from sources, but I don't know how to do that in Windows. I found an article on how to do it for Linux (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-compile-tensorflow-2-3-with-cuda-11-1-8cbecffcb8d3).
