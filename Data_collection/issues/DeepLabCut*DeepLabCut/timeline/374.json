thanks. Could you make a short screen video of this, i.e. open the frame in the refinement, move points, save, close, merge, run check labels?

So, could you also share one of the raw imgs that doesn't save properly, and what video type are you generating these from? I.e. do you see the same errors if you converted video to mp4, ran analyze_videos then extracted outliers?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/514812310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/515579817","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/374#issuecomment-515579817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/374","id":515579817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTU3OTgxNw==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T19:56:17Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T19:56:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just for those following along; we could not reproduce the error even on @ericabusch data on our computer, so it's unclear what is the issue in saving the images on their end; i.e. the file is being written correctly from the refinement gui...
