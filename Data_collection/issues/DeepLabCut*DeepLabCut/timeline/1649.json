What `track_method` are you using? Also, if you haven't already, have a look here https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html#optimized-animal-assembly-video-analysis. This § may be relevant in your case:\r\n\r\n> Animal assembly and tracking quality can be assessed via deeplabcut.utils.make_labeled_video.create_video_from_pickled_tracks. This function provides an additional diagnostic tool before moving on to refining tracklets.\r\n> \r\n> If animal assemblies do not look pretty, an alternative to the outlier search described above is to pass the _assemblies.pickle to find_outliers_in_raw_data in place of the _full.pickle. This will focus the outlier search on unusual assemblies (i.e., animal skeletons that were oddly reconstructed). This may be a bit more sensitive with crowded scenes or frames where animals interact closely. Note though that at that stage it is likely preferable anyway to carry on with the remaining steps, and extract outliers from the final h5 file as was customary in single animal projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1076090713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeylau","id":30733203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMzMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30733203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau","html_url":"https://github.com/jeylau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeylau/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6289627811,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c5CU1T-zwAAAAF25Bqj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6289627811","actor":{"login":"advmsbrdn16","id":98295185,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdvdkQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98295185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16","html_url":"https://github.com/advmsbrdn16","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-23T08:39:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6289627821,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c5CU1T-zwAAAAF25Bqt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6289627821","actor":{"login":"advmsbrdn16","id":98295185,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdvdkQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98295185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16","html_url":"https://github.com/advmsbrdn16","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advmsbrdn16/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-23T08:39:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6599621145,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5BM6c5CU1T-zwAAAAGJXjoZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/6599621145","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-12T15:56:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
