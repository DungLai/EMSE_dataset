Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI am trying to do a new install of DLC with the GUI, and every time I try I get an error that prevents installation. Every other topic I can find where someone had this issue seems to be Linux/Ubuntu specific, but I am on Windows 10.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n(trying to install the latest one, not successful yet)\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\ngpu\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn anaconda environment:\r\n`pip install deeplabcut[gui]`\r\n\r\nEverything goes smoothly until the code below.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: wxpython\r\n  Building wheel for wxpython (setup.py) ... error\r\n  ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:\r\n   command: 'C:\\Users\\ckelly\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc\\python.exe' -u -c 'import io, os, sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = '\"'\"'C:\\\\Users\\\\ckelly\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pip-install-l5f7lqo0\\\\wxpython_7860fedbfb274deb8a567c6351fd0ef4\\\\setup.py'\"'\"'; __file__='\"'\"'C:\\\\Users\\\\ckelly\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pip-install-l5f7lqo0\\\\wxpython_7860fedbfb274deb8a567c6351fd0ef4\\\\setup.py'\"'\"';f = getattr(tokenize, '\"'\"'open'\"'\"', open)(__file__) if os.path.exists(__file__) else io.StringIO('\"'\"'from setuptools import setup; setup()'\"'\"');code = f.read().replace('\"'\"'\\r\\n'\"'\"', '\"'\"'\\n'\"'\"');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, '\"'\"'exec'\"'\"'))' bdist_wheel -d 'C:\\Users\\ckelly\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-wheel-3rpx0zve'\r\n       cwd: C:\\Users\\ckelly\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-install-l5f7lqo0\\wxpython_7860fedbfb274deb8a567c6351fd0ef4\\\r\n  Complete output (37 lines):\r\n  C:\\Users\\ckelly\\Anaconda3\\envs\\dlc\\lib\\site-packages\\setuptools\\dist.py:717: UserWarning: Usage of dash-separated 'license-file' will not be supported in future versions.

else?\n\nProgram Versions (if this helps): \r\n- Python 3.9.7\r\n- cudatoolkit 11.2.2\r\n- cuDNN 8.1.0.77\r\n- tensorflow 2.5.0\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting attempts so far:\r\nI have tried installing wxPython separately with both pip and conda install. Using conda-forge I can successfully install wxython on its own but still get the same error when attempting to pip install deeplabcut.\r\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this
