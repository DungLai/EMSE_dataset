They should be under 'init_weights' (see path in the pose_cfg.yaml file). For Windows, also please install GITBASH https://gitforwindows.org/ and OPEN cmd by right-clicking \"run as ADIM\"\r\n\r\nYou can \"cd\" in the terminal to the package location!\r\n\r\ni.e. in linux copy and paste this in: cd usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/\r\n\r\nin Windows: cd C:\\Users\\YourComputerName\\Anaconda3\\envs\\DLC\\Lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut\\pose_estimation_tensorflow\\models\\pretrained\r\n\r\nAnd if you type \"ls\" to see the list of files, you should see the resnet: resnet_v1_50.ckpt\r\n\r\nIf it is not there, run sudo download.sh then change the permissions: sudo chown yourusername:yourusername resnet_v1_50.ckpt\r\n\r\nSee more tips here:
