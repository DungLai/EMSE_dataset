everyone.\r\nSo I finally got my mac running DLC, but as expected, it is taking quite a lot of time to calculate.\r\nTherefore I thought about an input by MMathisLab two weeks ago (https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1343#issue-927612925), mentioning Google COLAB.\r\nWell, because we have to work with confidential data, which isn't allowed to be stored anywhere outside of our research-computers, I wanted to ask, if there might be a way to use COLAB without copying the data onto google-servers. \r\nAll I could find (as someone who's not well versed in IT-topics) sounds like I would have to copy our data, but maybe someone here knows a way to use the processing-power of COLAB while looking at data still only stored on my machine?\r\n\r\nI whish you all a great weekend and thank you for all the help dring the last weeks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
