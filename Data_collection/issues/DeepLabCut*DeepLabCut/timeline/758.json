We get these types of videos where there is a bit of ID switching and even some \"hallucination\" of animals:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1bATx-SkYGNN8cbfYLho4oQSXpjVknsxb/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n2.  Re the animal ID switching,  I know we can use the tracklet GUI to correct these, but for our videos that is a very slow process (it takes multiple seconds every time I press a button or scroll on the tracklet-GUI interface).  I assume that the \"animal ID\" switching occurs at the inference stage and there's not much that can be done other than training on more data and then perhaps fixing offline?  Can you please confirm?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this is a lot of progress, we're getting excited about starting to do analysis.  \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your support and help! \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\naddlikelihoods: 0.15\r\naveragescore: 0.1\r\nboundingboxslack: 0\r\ndetectionthresholdsquare: 0\r\ndistnormalization: 1000\r\ndistnormalizationLOWER: 0\r\niou_threshold: 0.2\r\nlowerbound_factor: 0.5\r\nmax_age: 100\r\nmethod: m1\r\nmin_hits: 3\r\nminimalnumberofconnections: 4\r\npafthreshold: 0.08\r\ntopktoretain: 4\r\nupperbound_factor: 1.25\r\nvariant: 0\r\nwithid: false\r\n\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/649100943/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"catubc","id":4267452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4267452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc","html_url":"https://github.com/catubc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catubc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/649894290","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/758#issuecomment-649894290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/758","id":649894290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTg5NDI5MA==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-26T01:13:21Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T01:13:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"What is the pcutoff in that video - indeed looks wild, but I guess you are plotting everything, even low estimate \"guesses.\"  But I don't have time to optimize your parameters for this, unfortunately that is indeed up to the user ;).
