again.\r\n\r\nI'm still trying to get my test script running [](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1359#issue-930967420) and ran into 3 new errors. Two of them I could find and solve trough other issues on here, but this one I can't find outside of the DLC-forum and I really don't wanna make it worse again, so I rather ask once to often. While trying to generate frames and create a video, the process seems to fork (whatever that exactly means).\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Code output</summary><p>\r\n\r\n(base) UniversitysiMac:~ psydev20$ conda activate DLC-CPU\r\n(DLC-CPU) UniversitysiMac:~ psydev20$ cd /Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut\r\n(DLC-CPU) UniversitysiMac:DeepLabCut psydev20$ cd examples\r\n(DLC-CPU) UniversitysiMac:examples psydev20$ pythonw testscript.py\r\nImported DLC!\r\nOn Windows/OSX tensorpack is not tested by default.\r\nCREATING PROJECT\r\nCreated \"/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/videos\"\r\nCreated \"/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/labeled-data\"\r\nCreated \"/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/training-datasets\"\r\nCreated \"/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/dlc-models\"\r\nCopying the videos\r\n/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/videos/reachingvideo1.avi\r\nGenerated \"/Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples/TEST-Alex-2021-06-30/config.yaml\"\r\n\r\nA new project with name TEST-Alex-2021-06-30 is created at /Users/psydev20/Desktop/DeepLabCut/examples and a configurable file (config.yaml) is stored there.
