We also wondered what the most efficient way is to manually correct labels, and we settled on developing specific GUIs for this. These GUIs that allow us to check the labels and correct them (as well as manually correct DLC labels in case there are errors). \r\n\r\nWe will release the code as soon (currently beta testers are checking it out).
