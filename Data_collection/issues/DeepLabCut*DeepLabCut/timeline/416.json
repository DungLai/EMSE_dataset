(For context, I'm interested in appropriately calibrated uncertainties because I'd like to implement uncertainty-weighted estimation of 3d position from a multi-camera array. For 3d setups w/ freely moving animals, where this kind of occlusion might be present on >25% of frames, w/ partial occlusions even more frequent, properly weighting measurements from different cameras might substantially improve performance?)\r\n\r\n- You can set the `num_parts` during video analysis, which can help with triangulating this. Of course, you would need to have multiple cameras for 3d freely moving behavior. \r\n\r\n> It seems like a simple alternative would be to allow users to specify a level of spatial precision during the manual labeling process?\r\n\r\n- you can set a level of precision for training, i.e. pos_dist_threshold (see Box2), but not per body part. but you could create multiple models, one for course inference, one for fine and combine those results. \r\n\r\n we will also release more code in the future that will help with these issues, but it's an active research area in our lab for now.
