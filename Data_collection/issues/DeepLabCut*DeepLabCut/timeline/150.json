I am not sure what to do about this as I am not the administrator account on this Lab PC. Do I need to ask my PI for access to the Admin user or is there a work around.\r\n\r\n[Image removed by sender. image]<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57931859/92187648-36d3ed00-ee0f-11ea-9b8c-c93533cd97c7.png>\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/150#issuecomment-686839551>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AE7CMXSFIR52PI6TPXOM75DSEA4B5ANCNFSM4GKV7GSA>.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/687204855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
