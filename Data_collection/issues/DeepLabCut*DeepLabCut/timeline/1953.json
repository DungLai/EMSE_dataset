to clarify, what about wxpython==4.1.1 should not work? I ask because this is the version we have been using with the stand alone GUI for months now, on other installations on the same computer without wxpython errors.  These installations were installed when I believe numpy <1.22 was the default.\r\n\r\nI may be misunderstanding, but isn't `pip install deeplabcut` an installation that does not use an anaconda environment? Would this not be problematic given our standard DLC anaconda environments contain downgraded versions of various packages?  Additionally, we have multiple anaconda DLC installations for testing/debugging and undergrad training purposes, unfortunately we have yet to get docker working properly, so that is not an option. We have had so many Linux package issues (both related and unrelated to DLC), that we are wary of installing DLC outside of anaconda.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your feedback, thank you!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1222648978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anpeter1","id":32559387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTU5Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32559387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1","html_url":"https://github.com/anpeter1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anpeter1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1222668615","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1953#issuecomment-1222668615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1953","id":1222668615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c5I4HFH","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T17:24:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T17:24:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`pip install deeplabcut` can be used in a conda env, it is just the headless version (no GUI).
