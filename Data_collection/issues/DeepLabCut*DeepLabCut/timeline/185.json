However, as Mackenzie says (quoting from paper): it is also possible to run the network training steps of DeepLabCut in the supplied Docker, or on cloud computing resources (such as AWS, Google, or on a University cluster). For running DeepLabCut on certain platforms you will need to suppress the GUI support. This can be done by setting an *environment variable* before loading the\r\ntoolbox:\r\n\r\nLinux: ```export DLClight=True```\r\nWindows: ```set DLClight=True```\r\n\r\nIf you want to re-engage the
