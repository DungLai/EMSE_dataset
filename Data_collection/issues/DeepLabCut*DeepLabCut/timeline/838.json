 Thanks so much for the reply.\r\n\r\n1.  Re: the native DLC GUI, it's not working very well for our recordings (25FPS, 1280 x 1024 x 1hr) - it can take up to 1min to just load, and then gets stuck during plotting.  So I've written a different GUI for analysis.  I have explored the \"fill in everything\" and some of the other windows - and it helps merge lot of small snippets, so that's very useful. For example, for our 4 animal recordings, we are initaitlly missing between 18% to 58% of the data, and after connecting some of the snippets, we are only missing between 11% and 47% of the data. So 5-10% additional frames/connections are created.\r\n\r\n2.  Our question is whether this is the best we can do when the inference step looks much better?  Is the animal assembly step  throwing too much good inference information?  Here's the steps for creating tracklets:\r\n\r\ni)  Run DLC-GUI to analyze videos;\r\n\r\nii) drop into jupyter notebook DLC and generate the bx.pickle file with this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconvert_detections2tracklets(config,\r\n    videos,\r\n    videotype=\"avi\",\r\n    shuffle=1,\r\n    trainingsetindex=0,\r\n    overwrite=False,\r\n    destfolder=None,\r\n    BPTS=None,\r\n    iBPTS=None,\r\n    PAF=None,\r\n    printintermediate=False,\r\n    inferencecfg=None,\r\n    modelprefix=\"\",\r\n    track_method=\"box\",\r\n    edgewisecondition=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the inference yaml config like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\naddlikelihoods: 0.15\r\naveragescore: 0.1\r\nboundingboxslack: 0\r\ndetectionthresholdsquare: 0.1\r\ndistnormalization: 1000\r\ndistnormalizationLOWER: 0\r\niou_threshold: 0.2\r\nlowerbound_factor: 0.5\r\nmax_age: 100\r\nmethod: m1\r\nmin_hits: 3\r\nminimalnumberofconnections: 7\r\npafthreshold: 0.1\r\ntopktoretain: 4\r\nupperbound_factor: 1.25\r\nvariant: 0\r\nwithid: false\r\n```\r\n\r\niii) we then convert the pickle to h5:\r\n\r\n`convert_raw_tracks_to_h5(config, picklefile)`\r\n\r\nSo the videos above show the inference works really well, but there are a lot of unlabeled frames / animal.
