I wasn't clear with the request, sorry about that.  What I meant was, when creating a new project (deeplabcut.create_new_project), I would like to point to a folder that contains a sequence of images (in either .tiff format or .numpy format), instead of a video.  \r\n\r\nThis saves the effort of converting a sequence of images into a video format, which will anyways be used to extract back into individual images.  Further, most video formats require a certain amount of compression that decreases image quality.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, deeplabcut.analyze_time_lapse_frames is for analyzing a sequence of images AFTER having already created a training dataset.  This isn't what I wanted.  \r\n\r\nThanks again for all the effort with this!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/1039350742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ashwin-miriyala","id":50625947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjI1OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50625947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwin-miriyala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwin-miriyala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
