If the plots are not closed, then this will just plot over the existing plot (if any), which we don't want (i.e. see https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/generate_training_dataset/frame_extraction.py#L104) . If you want to disable this, you can of course just place a `#` in front of line 91 in your local copy of DLC. To find this, you can use `deeplabcut.__file__` to find the location where the package is installed, and edit your version only. hope that helps.

In the meantime I will comment out the line in my local copy, but I would appreciate a rigorous solution to this problem eventually\r\n\r\nI would also appreciate if you would not close issues before there is at least some consensus that the issue has been resolved.
