We used **TensorFlow 1.0 with CUDA (Cuda 8.0) in the Nature Neuro paper**. Therefore, we recommend this version. Many other versions of TensorFlow have been tested, but use at your own risk (i.e. these versions have been tested 1.2, 1.4, 1.8 or 1.10, but **might require different CUDA versions**! Please check your driver/CUDA/TensorFlow version [on this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30820513/what-is-version-of-cuda-for-nvidia-304-125/30820690#30820690).\r\n\r\nIf you have a GPU, you should then install the NVIDIA CUDA package and an appropriate driver for your specific GPU. Please follow the instructions found here: \\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu} Some tips will follow here:\r\n\r\n**FIRST**, install a driver for your GPU (we recommend the 384.xx) Find DRIVER HERE: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx\r\n- check which driver is installed by typing this into the terminal: ``nvidia-smi``\r\n\r\n**SECOND**, install CUDA (9.0 here): https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive\r\n\r\n**THIRD**, install TensorFlow: \r\n\r\nAvailable packages for pip install:\r\n\r\n``pip install tensorflow`` —Current release for CPU-only (recommended for beginners)\r\n\r\n``pip install tensorflow-gpu`` —Current release with GPU support (Ubuntu and Windows)\r\n\r\nSpecify the version by using: ``pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.10``\r\n\r\n**FOURTH**, Please check your CUDA and [TensorFlow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) with the lines below:\r\n\r\nStart a python session: \r\n`` ipython``\r\n\r\n``import tensorflow as tf``\r\n\r\n``sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))``\r\n\r\nYou can test that your GPU is being properly engaged with these additional [tips](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/using_gpu).\r\n\r\nHere are some additional resources users have found helpful (posted without endorsement):\r\n\r\n- http://blog.nitishmutha.com/tensorflow/2017/01/22/TensorFlow-with-gpu-for-windows.html\r\n\r\n- https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive\r\n\r\n- http://www.python36.com/install-tensorflow-gpu-windows/\r\n\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/431682806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1916862862,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkxNjg2Mjg2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1916862862","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-21T22:18:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
