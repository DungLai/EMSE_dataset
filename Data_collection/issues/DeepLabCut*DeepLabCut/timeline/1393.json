In general we ask that Q's go to the forum, bugs go here. \r\n\r\n train error is 1.42 pixels, and the test error is 73.66 pixels -- compared to my first model which had train error of 1.52 pixels, Test error of 3.85 pixels\r\n\r\n> so, this looks like overfitting - how much more did you train the model, given it was already at 1M iterations? I.e., the train went down (seems very low, most humans are not less that 2 pixel accurate), and the test is very bad as the model is over-trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the workflow, if the model is not performing well you extract outlier frames, these get clustered, and you re-label example bad frames. then you must merge. This changes the iteration #, and you create a new training dataset. Then you train from scratch again, i.e. don't edit pose_cfg.yaml, and then train.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/876577776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4996024876,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDk5NjAyNDg3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4996024876","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T16:26:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4996024882,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk5NjAyNDg4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4996024882","actor":{"login":"rshteyn","id":82400459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDAwNDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82400459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn","html_url":"https://github.com/rshteyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T16:26:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4996024885,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5OTYwMjQ4ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4996024885","actor":{"login":"rshteyn","id":82400459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDAwNDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82400459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn","html_url":"https://github.com/rshteyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshteyn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T16:26:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4996025480,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ5OTYwMjU0ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4996025480","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_
