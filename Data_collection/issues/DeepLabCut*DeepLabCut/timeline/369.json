There are filters included in DLC if this is needed (see below).\r\n\r\nLong answer:\r\nWe have thought about this -- in the original paper [DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y), we write:\r\n\r\n\"As presented, DeepLabCut extracts the posture data frame by frame, but one can add temporal filtering to improve performance (as for other approaches). Here we omitted such methods because of the high precision of the model without these additional steps, as well as to highlight the accurate prediction based on single frames **solely driven by within-frame visual information** in a variety of contexts.\r\n\r\nWhile temporal information could indeed be beneficial in certain contexts, challenges remain to using end-to-end-trained deep architectures for video data to extract postures. Because of the curse of dimensionality, deep architectures on videos must rely on input images with lower spatial resolution, and thus the best-performing action recognition algorithms still rely on frame-by-frame analysis with deep networks pretrained on ImageNet as a result of hardware limitations. As this is an active area of research, we believe this situation is likely to change with improvements in hardware (and in deep learning algorithms), and this should have a strong influence on pose estimation in the future. Therefore currently, in situations where occlusions are very common, such as in social behaviors, pairwise interactions could also be added to improve performance. Here we have focused on the deep feature detectors alone to demonstrate remarkable transfer learning for laboratory tasks without the need for such extensions.\"\r\n\r\nI omitted the references for clarity here - but you can find them in the paper. The package allows filtering as post-processing, after inference. You can use it by:\r\n\r\n```deeplabcut.filterpredictions```\r\n\r\nThe docs state:\r\n```Signature: deeplabcut.filterpredictions(config, video, videotype='avi', shuffle=1, trainingsetindex=0, p_bound=0.001, ARdegree=3, MAdegree=1, alpha=0.01, save_as_csv=True, destfolder=None)\r\nDocstring:\r\nFits frame-by-frame pose predictions with SARIMAX model.\r\n\r\nParameter\r\n----------\r\nconfig : string\r\n    Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.\r\n\r\nvideo : string\r\n    Full path of the video to extract the frame from. Make sure that this video is already analyzed.\r\n\r\nshuffle : int, optional\r\n    The shufle index of training dataset. The extracted frames will be stored in the labeled-dataset for\r\n    the corresponding shuffle of training dataset. Default is set to 1\r\n\r\ntrainingsetindex: int, optional\r\n    Integer specifying which TrainingsetFraction to use. By default the first (note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml).\r\n\r\ncomparisonbodyparts: list of strings, optional\r\n    This select the body parts for which SARIMAX models are fit. Either ``all``, then all body parts\r\n    from config.yaml are used orr a list of strings that are a subset of the full list.\r\n    E.g. ['hand','Joystick'] for the demo Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30/config.yaml to select only these two body parts.\r\n\r\np_bound: float between 0 and 1, optional\r\n    For outlieralgorithm 'uncertain' this parameter defines the likelihood below, \r\n    below which a body part will be consided as missing data for filtering purposes.\r\n\r\nARdegree: int, optional\r\n    For outlieralgorithm 'fitting': Autoregressive degree of Sarimax model degree.\r\n    see https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\r\n\r\nMAdegree: int\r\n    For outlieralgorithm 'fitting': Moving Avarage degree of Sarimax model degree.\r\n    See https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\r\n\r\nalpha: float\r\n    Significance level for detecting outliers based on confidence interval of fitted SARIMAX model.\r\n\r\nsave_as_csv: bool, optional\r\n    Saves the predictions in a .csv file. The default is ``False``; if provided it must be either ``True`` or ``False``\r\n\r\ndestfolder: string, optional\r\n    Specifies the destination folder for analysis data (default is the path of the video). Note that for subsequent analysis this \r\n    folder also needs to be passed.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n--------\r\ndeeplabcut.filterpredictions('C:\\myproject\\reaching-task\\config.yaml',['C:\\myproject\\trailtracking-task\\test.mp4'],shuffle=3,ARdegree=5,MAdegree=2)\r\n\r\nOne can then use the filtered rather than the frame-by-frame predictions by calling:\r\n    \r\ndeeplabcut.plot_trajectories('C:\\myproject\\reaching-task\\config.yaml',['C:\\myproject\\trailtracking-task\\test.mp4'],shuffle=3,filtered=True)\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.create_labeled_video('C:\\myproject\\reaching-task\\config.yaml',['C:\\myproject\\trailtracking-task\\test.mp4'],shuffle=3,filtered=True)\r\n--------\r\n\r\nReturns filtered pandas array with the same structure as normal output of network.```\r\n\r\nHope that helps!
