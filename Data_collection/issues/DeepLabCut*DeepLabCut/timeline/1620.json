Mackenzie,\r\n\r\nI've checked the FAQ page for GPU's, downloaded a new driver (497.29), updated CUDA (11.5) then reinstalled Deeplabcut using the anaconda command prompt. I've also used conda install cudnn -c conda-forge ​after activating the environment but am still having issues. In ipython when I start training, the Dedicated GPU memory usage increases which is correct but there is no activity from CUDA. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as it seems like I've done everything correctly according to GitHub and the FAQ page and only started having these issues when I updated everything from DLC-GPU to your newest version. Thanks again for all the help and hopefully can get deeplabcut up and running again as it's helped me so much with my research.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBrendan\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom:

Mackenzie,\n\nSo updating DLC allows me to use my GPU for all processes except training. I tried both deeplabcut.train_network(config_path) and train_network(config_path,shuffle=1,trainingsetindex=0,gputouse=None,max_snapshots_to_keep=5, displayiters=1000,saveiters=20000, maxiters=200000) all I get is that it starts training then nothing happens after even if I wait days there are no iterations. Sometimes I get the error message:\n2022-01-20 09:47:44.909180: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:366] Loaded cuDNN version 8201\n2022-01-20 09:47:50.465254: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/bfc_allocator.cc:275] Allocator (GPU_0_bfc) ran out of memory trying to allocate 2.22GiB with freed_by_count=0.

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nI have created a project using the GUI. When I switch to Colab to train, there are no errors but it gets stuck on training. I run deeplabcut.train_network, it loads the config and overwrites max_iters/display_iters/save_iters, it says \"Starting training...\" and then nothing happens. The cell appears to be running, but nothing else shows up.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10 Home\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.6\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nColab Pro GPU\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn Google Colab:\r\n\r\n`!pip install deeplabcut\r\n%reload_ext numpy\r\n%reload_ext scipy\r\n%reload_ext matplotlib\r\n%reload_ext mpl_toolkits\r\n\r\n!pip install --upgrade scikit-image\r\n!pip3 install pickle5\r\n\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\nimport pickle5 as pickle\r\n\r\nfrom google.colab import drive\r\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\r\n\r\nProjectFolderName = 'TST-AS-2022-03-03'\r\nVideoType = 'mp4'\r\nvideofile_path = ['/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/'+ProjectFolderName+'/videos/']\r\nvideofile_path\r\npath_config_file = '/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/'+ProjectFolderName+'/config.yaml'\r\npath_config_file\r\n\r\nshuffle = 1\r\ndeeplabcut.create_training_dataset(path_config_file, net_type='resnet_50', Shuffles=[shuffle], augmenter_type='imgaug', windows2linux=True)\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.train_network(path_config_file, shuffle=shuffle, displayiters=10,saveiters=50, maxiters=500000, allow_growth=True)`\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nConfig:\r\n{'all_joints': [[0], [1], [2]],\r\n 'all_joints_names': ['tip', 'mid', 'butt'],\r\n 'alpha_r': 0.02,\r\n 'apply_prob': 0.5,\r\n 'batch_size': 1,\r\n 'clahe': True,\r\n 'claheratio': 0.1,\r\n 'crop_pad': 0,\r\n 'crop_sampling': 'hybrid',\r\n 'crop_size': [400, 400],\r\n 'cropratio': 0.4,\r\n 'dataset': 'training-datasets/iteration-0/UnaugmentedDataSet_TSTMar3/TST_AS95shuffle1.mat',\r\n 'dataset_type': 'imgaug',\r\n 'decay_steps': 30000,\r\n 'deterministic': False,\r\n 'display_iters': 1000,\r\n 'edge': False,\r\n 'emboss': {'alpha': [0.0, 1.0], 'embossratio': 0.1, 'strength': [0.5, 1.5]},\r\n 'fg_fraction': 0.25,\r\n 'global_scale': 0.8,\r\n 'histeq': True,\r\n 'histeqratio': 0.1,\r\n 'init_weights': '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/models/pretrained/resnet_v1_50.ckpt',\r\n 'intermediate_supervision': False,\r\n 'intermediate_supervision_layer': 12,\r\n 'location_refinement': True,\r\n 'locref_huber_loss': True,\r\n 'locref_loss_weight': 0.05,\r\n 'locref_stdev': 7.2801,\r\n 'log_dir': 'log',\r\n 'lr_init': 0.0005,\r\n 'max_input_size': 1500,\r\n 'max_shift': 0.4,\r\n 'mean_pixel': [123.68, 116.779, 103.939],\r\n 'metadataset': 'training-datasets/iteration-0/UnaugmentedDataSet_TSTMar3/Documentation_data-TST_95shuffle1.pickle',\r\n 'min_input_size': 64,\r\n 'mirror': False,\r\n 'multi_stage': False,\r\n 'multi_step': [[0.005, 10000],\r\n                [0.02, 430000],\r\n                [0.002, 730000],\r\n                [0.001, 1030000]],\r\n 'net_type': 'resnet_50',\r\n 'num_joints': 3,\r\n 'optimizer': 'sgd',\r\n 'pairwise_huber_loss': False,\r\n 'pairwise_predict': False,\r\n 'partaffinityfield_predict': False,\r\n 'pos_dist_thresh': 17,\r\n 'pre_resize': [],\r\n 'project_path': '/content/drive/My Drive/DLC/TST-AS-2022-03-03',\r\n 'regularize': False,\r\n 'rotation': 25,\r\n 'rotratio': 0.4,\r\n 'save_iters': 50000,\r\n 'scale_jitter_lo': 0.5,\r\n 'scale_jitter_up': 1.25,\r\n 'scoremap_dir': 'test',\r\n 'sharpen': False,\r\n 'sharpenratio': 0.3,\r\n 'shuffle': True,\r\n 'snapshot_prefix': '/content/drive/My '\r\n                    'Drive/DLC/TST-AS-2022-03-03/dlc-models/iteration-0/TSTMar3-trainset95shuffle1/train/snapshot',\r\n 'stride': 8.0,\r\n 'weigh_negatives': False,\r\n 'weigh_only_present_joints': False,\r\n 'weigh_part_predictions': False,\r\n 'weight_decay': 0.0001}\r\nSelecting single-animal trainer\r\nBatch Size is 1\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer_v1.py:1694: UserWarning: `layer.apply` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

CPU usage is at about 1%, so I don't think it's just a matter of not using the GPU. I can run the test scripts successfully on this machine in this environment. \r\n\r\nThis issue is reminiscent of #536 but not in Windows and terminating much earlier.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
