It's because I wanted to train all the videos with the same number of times(max_iter). You know, if max_iter is high, than overfitting happened. Or max_iter is low, than underfitting happened. And In fact, I feel 1030000(which is the number in existing program, cfg.multi_step[-1][1]) is too big number for our training. Surely I can stop it by interrupting during executing the training, but I don't want to watching the whole iteration step all the time and stop it in same iteration. So I thought manipulating max_iter is needed.\r\n2. Umm.. the error happened in line number 4.\r\n----> 4 deeplabcut.create_new_project(task,experimenter,video, working_directory='C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop', copy_videos=True) #change the working directory to where you want the folders created.\r\nCould you let me know the meaning of \"The path must be a string that is passed for videos and for the working directory.\"? Do you mean that the working directory cannot be a new directory?(should it be existing directory with some file?)\r\nAnd unfortunately, I tried 'C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop' and r'C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop' in line number 4, but the same errors happened.\r\nAlso, as your advice, I changed line number 3 by r'C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\Video_files_Deeplabcut\\\\LinearChamber\\\\20180906\\\\Trial(1).mpg', r'C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Desktop\\\\Video_files_Deeplabcut\\\\LinearChamber\\\\20180906\\\\Trial(2).mpg'\r\nwhich have no spaces.
