Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nThis is related to post on the [forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/labeled-video-without-the-whole-tracking-in-colab/57076/4) by another user, and the second issue raised in #1458 - but not the primary issue raised there so I'm creating a new issue. The forum post is from a mac (dlc version unknown), and I can reproduce on Windows, DLC 2.2.0.1.  \r\n\r\nAfter analyzing video, creating tracklets, and stitching tracklets, trying to load the refine tracklets GUI from the main GUI leads to a file not found error. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the same env, the refine tracklets gui opens fine when called from the command line and passing the path to the h5 or pickle file directly. Therefore, the must be a problem in the automatic construction of the filename when the refine tracklets button is pushed in the main GUI.\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10 (other posts suggest all platforms)\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nN/A\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. In an maDLC project, analyze a video, create tracklets, stitch tracklets\r\n2. From the main Deeplabcut GUI, open the the Refine Tracklets tab\r\n3. Select the video, click the \"refine tracklets\" button\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
