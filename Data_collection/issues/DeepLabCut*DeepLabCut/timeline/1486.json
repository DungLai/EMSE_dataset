The update of the \"deeplabcut\"-package using pip is using the pypi-repository as a source, where only the version you installed is available right now, as this package has to be updated as well. \r\nThis being said, you can unpin numpy in the package you already installed on your own. \r\nIf you go to the `deeplabcut-2.2.0.1.dist-info`-Folder, which lays somewhere like this:\r\n`C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\Lib\\site-packages\\deeplabcut-2.2.0.1.dist-info`\r\nyou can the open the `METADATA`-file in a texteditor and remove the required version behind `numpy`.\r\nIf you then do `pip install --upgrade deeplabcut` it should install the right version of Tensorflow along with the right dependencies for it.\r\n \r\nI hope that works for you. \r\n\r\nP.S. You might encounter the wx.Locale - Issue with matplotlib, as you are working on a Windows-machine. If you do: \r\nAdd this line `locale = wx.Locale(wx.LANGUAGE_ENGLISH)` to the functions \"_load_bitmap(filename)\" and \"_set_frame_icon(frame)\" in the `C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\DEEPLABCUT\\Lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\backends\\backend_wx`-File. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/911698996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anmabu","id":88141543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTQxNTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88141543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu","html_url":"https://github.com/anmabu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anmabu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5247594574,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB5BM6c46ozrLzwAAAAE4x_BO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5247594574","actor":{"login":"quirinkrabi","id":89841165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODQxMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89841165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi","html_url":"https://github.com/quirinkrabi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-02T13:43:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5247594579,"node_id":"SE_lADOB5BM6c46ozrLzwAAAAE4x_BT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5247594579","actor":{"login":"quirinkrabi","id":89841165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODQxMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89841165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi","html_url":"https://github.com/quirinkrabi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quirinkrabi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-02T13:43:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
