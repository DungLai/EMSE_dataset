I think @maryeveh  suggests to literally go to https://github.com/imageio/imageio-binaries/raw/master/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-osx-v3.2.4 (in your browser and download it manually). So that there is no ssl certificate error.

am not an expert in differences between curl and wget, but there are some differences in the way they complete downloads (https://daniel.haxx.se/docs/curl-vs-wget.html). Maybe curl does not download everything that is needed, aka no the ssl certificate. \r\nYou can use wget on Mac (I am using a Mac). You have to install homebrew by typing the following line in your terminal: /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\r\nThen you type brew install wget and it should install it. \r\nI hope this helps.
