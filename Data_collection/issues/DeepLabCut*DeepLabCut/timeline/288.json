There are some things in this installation that are unexpected, but glad you were able to get a working solution. Just for reference:\r\n\r\n## Case 1\r\nI am unable to replicate the issue you ran into i.e. the parent directory of `deeplabcut.__file__` points to an egg file. Usually I install from source with the following commands:\r\n```\r\njchu@ubuntu:~/code$ git clone https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut\r\njchu@ubuntu:~/code$ cd DeepLabCut\r\njchu@ubuntu:~/code/DeepLabCut$ pip install .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen after importing `deeplabcut`, `deeplabcut.__file__` is `/home/jchu/code/DeepLabCut/deeplabcut/__init__.py`, which is the expected output.\r\n\r\nRegarding virtual environment setup, so far docker and conda are the only de-facto methods that are officially supported. Unless you are required to use `virtualenv` or `pipenv`, I would highly recommend `conda`. It solves a lot of the dependency issues people have run into. Also there are advantages of using `conda` packages. For example, `numpy` will already be BLAS-optimized, `tensorflow-gpu` installs cuDNN and the CUDA toolkit so you don't have to use a system-wide installation, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/492690764/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jchutrue","id":14321886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzIxODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14321886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue","html_url":"https://github.com/jchutrue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchutrue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2343607602,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0MzYwNzYwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2343607602","actor":{"login":"afunTW","id":4820492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjA0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4820492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW","html_url":"https://github.com/afunTW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-15T14:56:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2343607603,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDM2MDc2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2343607603","actor":{"login":"afunTW","id":4820492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjA0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4820492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW","html_url":"https://github.com/afunTW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-15T14:56:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/492907055","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/288#issuecomment-492907055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/288","id":492907055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjkwNzA1NQ==","user":{"login":"afunTW","id":4820492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjA0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4820492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW","html_url":"https://github.com/afunTW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afunTW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T03:56:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T03:56:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jchutrue
