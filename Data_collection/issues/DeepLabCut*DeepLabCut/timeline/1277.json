Here is how to do that: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/wiki/How-to-use-the-latest-GitHub-code\r\n\r\nAlso, the first warnings are numpy & tensorflow warning, but all will work; not an issue (if they annoy you, you can run `pip install numpy==1.16.4` and it goes away.\r\n\r\nThe missing file sometimes is a permissions issue (but I normally only see this on windows). Good thing is that if you are to the point in the script where you are at machine labels, everything is working in the install (just this file that gets written into the `test-alex-date` might not be able to write. You can also look at the test folder that is created and see if it's missing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/849043359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4801418585,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDgwMTQxODU4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4801418585","actor":{"login":"pondposaphiwat","id":70335919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzM1OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70335919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat","html_url":"https://github.com/pondposaphiwat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-26T19:04:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4801418589,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4MDE0MTg1ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4801418589","actor":{"login":"pondposaphiwat","id":70335919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzM1OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70335919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat","html_url":"https://github.com/pondposaphiwat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-26T19:04:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/849060585","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1277#issuecomment-849060585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1277","id":849060585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTA2MDU4NQ==","user":{"login":"pondposaphiwat","id":70335919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzM1OTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70335919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat","html_url":"https://github.com/pondposaphiwat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pondposaphiwat/received_
