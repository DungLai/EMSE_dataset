Set `videotype='.mp4'` in each of the function calls and they should work.~~ This is a slightly poor user experience IMO, it would be better to have the extension (if passed) override the `videotype` parameter and/or throw a warning if no videos are found, rather than just silently exiting.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: actually, re-reading your log I see you have passed `videotype='.mp4'`. In that case I'd guess DeepLabCut is not finding your videos for some other reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/573217436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"johnmbarrett","id":19190699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTkwNjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19190699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett","html_url":"https://github.com/johnmbarrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnmbarrett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2940082568,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk0MDA4MjU2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2940082568","actor":{"login":"eleonoreduroyon","id":32446840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ2ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32446840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon","html_url":"https://github.com/eleonoreduroyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eleonoreduroyon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-10T22:41:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
