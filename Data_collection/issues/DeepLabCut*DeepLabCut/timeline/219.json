Generally the accuracy and overall performance are really good. I experienced few corner cases while I'm training model to track rat/rodent in open field test for my CS master's thesis. We have lots of old and heterogeneous video material from open field type settings and noticed that with some of the videos the selection of canditates could have been more restricted. Some body parts were erratically jumping all over the place or switching back and forth with other detected parts. This happened especially with soft, low resolution and bad quality records with Sprague Dawley on white background. Not an easy task for AI, but it worked surprisingly well with more clearer cases.\r\n\r\nIf I understood the DeeperCut paper correctly, pairwise probabilities could restrict plausible poses of the body?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/466066312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lauritk","id":11596043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk2MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11596043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk","html_url":"https://github.com/lauritk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauritk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/466100608","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/219#issuecomment-466100608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/219","id":466100608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjEwMDYwOA==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T17:57:51Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T17:58:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Pairwise could help for jumping, however, in my experience jumping of body parts is due to some errors in the labeling data (flipped label, etc.).
