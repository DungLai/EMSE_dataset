The M1 chip is a big question, though. My wife recently purchased one, so I'm hoping to use some of my holiday \"break\" to test deeplabcut on that since I haven't seen anyone else bring it up.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the developers would also appreciate this kind of question being posted on the image.sc forum instead of as an issue on GitHub, so when I get test results I'll post my findings over there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/750920708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4147746015,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE0Nzc0NjAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4147746015","actor":{"login":"Hydraulic343","id":43321657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzIxNjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43321657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343","html_url":"https://github.com/Hydraulic343","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-24T16:18:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4147746016,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNDc3NDYwMTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4147746016","actor":{"login":"Hydraulic343","id":43321657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzIxNjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43321657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343","html_url":"https://github.com/Hydraulic343","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydraulic343/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-24T16:18:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4148088321,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNDgwODgzMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4148088321","actor":{"login":"ecresp1el","id":56608164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjA4MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56608164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el","html_url":"https://github.com/ecresp1el","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecresp1el/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-24T22:16:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCu

The headless version will be `pip install deeplabcut`, while the full GUI supported version is `pip install deeplabcut[gui]`.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean I will be using `deeplabcut` in the future as I use `deeplabcutcore` now? And the current `deeplabcut` is still the full GUI supported version, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/816718447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Joilence","id":14588641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTg4NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14588641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence","html_url":"https://github.com/Joilence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4574731726,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU3NDczMTcyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4574731726","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T14:21:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4574731739,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NzQ3MzE3Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4574731739","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T14:21:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4574731752,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU3NDczMTc1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4574731752","actor":{"login":"arge-7","id":68198440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTk4NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68198440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7","html_url":"https://github.com/arge-7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arge-7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-09T14:21:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4574731756,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NzQ3MzE3NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/4574731756","actor":{"login":"arge-7","id":68198440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNl
