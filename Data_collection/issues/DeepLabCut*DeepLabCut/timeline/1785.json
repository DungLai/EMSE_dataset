@JianzhiZhang1, like @MMathisLab above, I'd encourage you to use analyze_videos only in the first place, and I'd add that you could then run `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections` to visualize

This way, you'll be able to gauge whether the network has been trained well prior to animal assembly and tracking.
