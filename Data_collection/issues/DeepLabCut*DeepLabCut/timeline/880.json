\r\nMy bad about the version used by the way, a bit of research in our document shows that we use this commit from 2018 specifically [https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/commit/900105b78a6a394bd1cd2a6f63b21f18018804cd](url) without knowing the \"why\".\r\n\r\nWell using your image seems to be quite a long process + it does not support windows environnement which a big constraint knowing that Azure support Linux in a very limited way (i.e. our AppService plan is running on windows only).\r\nI'll try the forum and write the solution that works for me here if I found one.\r\nThank for your time !
