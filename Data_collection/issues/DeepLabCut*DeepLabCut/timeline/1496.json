It's not a problem on colab (as I originally thought with some similar errors), or with a specific ffmpeg installation because you get this error with your local installation and colab. Therefore it must be something with your video format. Just as with the previous issue, the bug occurs with ffmpeg or opencv encoding, which are used by, but are not part of, the deeplabcut code. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[mpeg4 @ 0000020dc9617080] timebase 500/124969 not supported by MPEG 4 standard, the maximum admitted value for the timebase denominator is 65535\r\nCould not open codec 'mpeg4': Unspecified error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat part also suggests that ffmpeg cannot fully read your video. It *can* read it, otherwise analyzing videos wouldn't work, but there's some other problem with the read/write functions. \r\n\r\n```\r\nGenerating frames and creating video.\r\n[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith save frames on suggests a file writing issue - either a permissions problem on the drive, or ffmpeg didn't actually save out individual frames.\r\n\r\nI would suggest reencoding the videos. See [this discussion](https://forum.image.sc/t/analyzing-new-videos-no-data/48313/5) for re-encoding options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/917173846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backyardbiomech","id":9662673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech","html_url":"https://github.com/backyardbiomech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backyardbiomech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5296496313,"node_id":"CE_lADOB5BM6c46-ZgizwAAAAE7sh65","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/5296496313","actor":{"login":"rhgoo","id":86977704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTc3NzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86977704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo","html_url":"https://github.com/rhgoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhgoo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-14T01:31:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
