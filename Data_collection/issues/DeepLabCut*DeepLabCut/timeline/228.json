Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nHi, Dear Alexander @AlexEMG , \r\nI wonder if i gave different label for different bodyparts in different animals, \r\nfor instance, \r\nanimal A: bodypart 1\r\nbodypart 2\r\nbodypart 3\r\nbodypart 4\r\nanimal B: body1\r\nbody2\r\nbody3\r\nbody4\r\nand then label them in the same video meanwhile,\r\nso what the result would be later when we do the training and video analysis: does it mean the data of these two animals will be in the same file and same plot? \r\nAnd another strange question to ask is:\r\ni delete one label in the config.yaml, and the numframes2pick: 20\r\nand then after extracting video and label video, i found the number of frame to label is more than 20. what the problems would be?\r\nAnd another question: i can not really understand what is this in config.yaml: \r\n# Plotting configuration\r\nskeleton:\r\n- - bodypart1\r\n  - bodypart2\r\n- - objectA\r\n  - bodypart3\r\n\r\nif i delete one label, how this would arranged? \r\nThank you for answer, \r\nGreetings, \r\nShauyin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/565444528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xiuxian620","id":40397232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk3MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40397232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620","html_url":"https://github.com/xiuxian620","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiuxian620/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2881398162,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg4MTM5ODE2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2881398162","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T13:40:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2881398163,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4ODEzOTgxNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/2881398163","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T13:40:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/633069087","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/228#issuecomment-633069087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/228","id":633069087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzA2OTA4Nw==","user":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-23T14:49:50Z","updated_at":"2020-05-23T14:49:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Starting
