Any reason as to why this might occur?_\r\n\r\nYes, this can happen with errors in meta-data of the video (see this issue and https://forum.image.sc/t/issue-to-align-detected-frames-with-time-scale/28710/5 for more explanation) \r\n\r\nSo your videos have 71564  according to the metadata, but end up having 72215 when it is decoded. This is very rare, but I'll make fix for this in the next release.
