Locref stands for location refinement layer, scmap - score map, PAF is a part affinity field (which I think in terms of training stats is named limb as it encodes pairwise relationships between bodyparts) . That being said, location refinement tries to find position of bodyparts based on their relation to other bodyparts, score maps look for parts of image that have a wanted feature (it helps to understand when you plot them at the evaluation step), PAF - explained in the brackets before. \r\n\r\nLR stands for learning rate which is a parameter controlling how strongly the weights should shift in pursue of the most optimal solution - hence why at first lr is high (the model gets close to finding where the bodyparts are faster) but then gets smaller to slowly adjust the weights so the model can get as precise as possible (think of it as change in weights shifting the placement of your label, first by 10s of pixels but then on a pixel level to find just the right spot).  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to architectures themselves it's something that is very complicated but generally can be summed up to different solutions to achieve as best result as possible under certain circumstances. \r\nResNets are Residual Neural Networks and they utilize this cool feature of having skip connections which help to solve the problem of vanishing gradient - when changes made to weights become too small to actually change anything. Very precise, not super computationally expensive, generally a good choice for most of the users. \r\nMobilNets have been created for the purpose of running low latency inference (analysis) on - you guessed it - mobile devices, which are constrained by their low computational power and aim at power efficiency. They are great for online (live) inference and can easily be used even on low end hardware to do just that - for instance if your experiment requires you to track the paw of your rat in lever pressing experiment and you want to start optogenetic excitation when the animal touches the lever.\r\nEfficientNets I understand the least of all those but from what I understand they work with compund scaling in mind, meaning instead of trying to make the architecture deeper or wider or using higher resolution images we can find a solution that's a sweet spot for all of those allowing us to get the best performance with least computational power - though from what I understand the problem here is the way they work is actually not optimal for how GPUs process data (albeit this is actually true for image processing generally as we try to move huge amounts of data with not that much computation done on this data).\r\n\r\nHope this helps to clear things up a little and I didn't make any horrible mistakes here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/992701744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KonradDanielewski","id":54865575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODY1NTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54865575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradDanielewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradDanielewski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/998271068","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1610#issuecomment-998271068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1610","id":998271068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c47gGhc","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-20T21:09:06Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T21:09:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@deplabcut
