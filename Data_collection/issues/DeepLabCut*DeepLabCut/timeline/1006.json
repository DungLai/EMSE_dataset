Sorry for the delayed response!\r\nI will definitely post the question in the required format from the next time! Sorry about that. \r\nI evaluated the network first to get those inf and nans in the output terminal. \r\nI included the first post as a background on the issues I was facing with the video labeling. I was able to get through evaluation results but I could see only one marker in the labelled video whereas I had plotted 6 during the labeling frames phase. \r\nI am not able to find the csv file in the evaluation results folder though. As for the labelled images, I am able to see a circular marker only for one of the markers I had labelled. The other markers (circular) are visible only in a few frames). The crosses are also marked for a few images and not marker for the others. \r\nI tried to do a single animal analysis for one of the videos and found a csv file for that but havent been able to find the csv file for any of the multi animal analysis I have done so far. Please let me know how I can do that. \r\nI apologize if I haven't understood the question completely... I am very new to this and would appreciate any help I can get! thanks in advance. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/734410598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Mahathy95","id":73698379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjk4Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73698379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95","html_url":"https://github.com/Mahathy95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/735377426","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1006#issuecomment-735377426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1006","id":735377426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTM3NzQyNg==","user":{"login":"Mahathy95","id":73698379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjk4Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73698379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95","html_url":"https://github.com/Mahathy95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahathy95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-29T11:19:58Z","updated_at":"2020-11-29T11:19:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @MMathisLab , over the weekend, I also tried to run it for 50,000 iterations with a reduced batch size of 1 since I was facing memory issues.
