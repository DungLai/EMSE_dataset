@DanielSanchezDiaz @mem1-create @kesiwilson -- this happens is ffmpeg is not installed, or you don't have permissions (typically a windows issue, i.e. in Windows you must right click and open the

will be for the latest, code, so a simple `pip install --upgrade deeplabcut` is good to run once after you activate `DLC-CPU`. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-02-07 at 10 42 19

Windows 10\r\nDeepLabCut Version: 2.2rc1\r\nAnaconda env used: DLC-CPU\r\n\r\nHi, I'm using deeplabcut as part of a student project.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to install deeplabcut on windows 10 (nvidia geforce RTX 2080) using either gpu or cpu, but I have been having issues trying to run the testscript.py file.\r\nInitially, when I set up my conda environment using the DLC-CPU.yaml file, I tried running the testscript.py and had the known error found here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1106 . \r\nIt was resolved by following the conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg advice. \r\nThen I got a new error similar to this one: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1265 . And so now I am stuck trying to upgrade the deeplabcut version from ‘2.1.10.4’ to ‘2.2rc1’. \r\nAfter upgrading to 2.2rc1 using pip install and trying to import deeplabcut, then I get what is shown in the screenshot below.\r\nI've also tried running ./reinstall.sh file, but it didn't work for windows so I've also tried directly running the following:\r\npip uninstall deeplabcut \r\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\r\npip install C:\\Users\\LabMi\\Documents\\GitHub\\DeepLabCut\\dist\\deeplabcut-2.2rc1-py3-none-any.whl \r\nHowever, I get the same error with import deeplabcut\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nI’ve tried upgrading different ways, but I always get the same error.\r\nHas someone been able to install deeplabcut on windows 10 and can show their steps for an updated clean walk through, with or without gpu?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71452451/120266584-3e2a0900-c270-11eb-85b9-dc6b9ea9ef84.png)\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
