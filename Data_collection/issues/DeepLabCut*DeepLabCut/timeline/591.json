After looking at the pose file within the test folder for the dlc_model iteration 3 the net type is: net_type: resnet_50. So it would make sense why it wasn't working with 101. However, I have previous csv files labeled as \"DLC_resnet101_ ... 300000-results\". \r\n\r\nSo I believe what I may have done is originally trained it on 101 and then retrained it using 50? If I were to retrain it again on 101 I assume it would switch back over.
