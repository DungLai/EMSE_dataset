thank you for the information . Quite strange, it does work for me in google collab but when i want to run it on a video without uploading it into drive it fails to work . \r\n\r\nI had checked the video path and the path is correct.  Is there a specific foler one must save the video  file into , to run it locally? \r\n\r\nFor now we want to analyze the keypoints from different videos on a pretrained model in order to get some statistics.  Perhaps our approach to run videos locally is not the right way but to upload it to drive. Please let us know what is the best approach to tackle the issue .
