Those directions are a lot clearer and flow better.

Then it's a 1 step installation. The Nature Protocols paper, I think, spells this out nicely (or at least our reviewers felt it was fine ;): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0176-0\r\n\r\nSo, could you perhaps be more specific on where we can improve this? I.e. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md\r\n\r\nIn the latest doc updates, we clarify this quite strongly: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md\r\n\r\nAlso, we don't have Docker in this repo because this is for more advanced users. Hence it's open repo and installation guide: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0\r\n\r\nNote, this is not the correct order:\r\n\r\n> One thing I get from that procedure is that Installing the GPU drivers is a separate step that is done after installing Anaconda, Deep LabCut, and before installing TensorFlow as a separate step.\r\n\r\nAnd for fresh ubuntu installations, I use this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeepLabCut/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0/wiki/Installation-of-NVIDIA-driver-and-CUDA-10\r\n\r\nAnd Ubuntu is the easiest to work within, hence why we suggest building your own conda file: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md#creating-your-own-customized-conda-env if you want to use conda. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.

I would like to help with the installation documentation for Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nWhat I do not like about the documentation I have found thus far is there is no explanation as to the overall architecture and the various components and how functionality is partitioned among the various components. My primary impression is a series of steps that are described with little to no background that leads to an understanding of the goal of each step and how each step furthers reaching the overall goal of getting the software installed and ready to use.\r\n\r\nI have found myself doing a lot of link clicking along with searches in order to better understand the installation process.\r\n\r\nAnother problem for me is that I do not know most of the tools involved. Anaconda was a species of snake from the Amazonian rainforest until a few weeks ago. So there is a lot of background information that I am missing which, if I already knew, would make all of this much less mysterious.\r\n\r\nAs an example in the installation.md at Step 3 there is a Please click here with a link followed by an note that says \"*If you have a GPU, you should FIRST then install the NVIDIA CUDA (10 or LOWER) package and an appropriate driver for your specific GPU. ..\" so does this mean this is the first thing to do in Step 3 or not?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what a `conda` file is though I assume it is some kind of an Anaconda script that runs in an Anaconda session. However I am unsure the breadth of that functionality and how much it does and what do I have after it runs?\r\n\r\nThen there is the use of `pip` which seems to be a python package installer which gets into the question of what done with `pip` and what is done with `conda` and what is done in a python shell.\r\n\r\nThere do seem to be decisions I must make such as the GPU driver to use as well as TensorFlow version and CUDA version yet I do not feel I have sufficient information and background knowledge to make an informed decision.\r\n\r\nI do know that with my first install, which did not result in a usable system, I made choices about TensorFlow and GPU driver version and CUDA version which resulted in what appeared to be warnings about incompatibilities as well as warnings that CUDA was already installed and it also looked like the ipython shell crashed when I was doing the TensorFlow installation test step.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with the paper in nature is in order to access it, I must pay for it though I do have access to a copy through the university and found a preprint PDF that looks to be reasonably complete.\r\n\r\nThe paper does have a nice flowchart for the workflow using the software however that made no sense until I worked in the biology lab this afternoon creating a new project, pulling in some of the video footage, extracted frames, and labeled the frames. That was as far as I got in an hour with Dr. Kane as she had other duties.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/591671571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RichardChambers","id":11844326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQ0MzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11844326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardChambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3075635671,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA3NTYzNTY3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3075635671","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-26T22:13:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3075635678,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNzU2MzU2Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3075635678","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-26T22:13:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/591681328","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596#issuecomment-591681328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596","id":591681328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTY4MTMyOA==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T22:39:32Z","updated_

 Here is my understanding of the software stack and some considerations for the hardware. This is just an overview and I have not yet gotten into the actual installation yet. I need to scrap my last install and do it all over again now that I have a better understanding of the process. I also have new equipment coming in so as to build a new DeepLabCut workstation. I chose an Intel i3 9100F CPU and 16GB of motherboard RAM with an NVIDIA RTX 2070 with 8GB of RAM and an NVMe PCIe M.2 drive. The motherboard has 4 slots so I can add an additional pair of 8GB sticks later.\r\n\r\nDeepLabCut is a machine learning application for the automated marking up of video footage to track the position of objects moving within the field of view of the camera. The software was originally created for research in animal biomechanics such as the limb movements of mice, horses, and other animals.\r\n\r\nDeepLabCut is written in the Python 3 programming language and uses the TensorFlow machine learning library. TensorFlow assists with the machine learning functionality required for DeepLabCut to analyze the frames of video footage searching for the desired features to identify the objects being tracked.\r\n\r\nThe preferred installation for DeepLabCut is to use the Anaconda software to manage the installation of the various software components that make up the DeepLabCut application. Anaconda makes the installation and use of DeepLabCut easier.\r\n\r\nThe machine learning software that DeepLabCut uses, TensorFlow, can be used as either a CPU only package or it can use the GPU for processing data. The CPU only approach is simpler however the GPU approach can be much faster in processing data, delivering results quicker.\r\n\r\nAnaconda packages all of the various software tools needed for an installation of DeepLabCut with one exception, the drivers and software libraries for a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) or video card needed for using TensorFlow with a GPU. The GPU software is a separate installation step.\r\n\r\nDeepLabCut can be used on any computer that provides the necessary environment (Python 3 and TensorFlow) since it is written in Python 3. However the most common use is with Ubuntu 64 bit Linux. It can also be used with Windows 10 and MacOS as there are versions of the underlying software, TensorFlow and Python 3, for those operating systems. However MacOS may have problems with using TensorFlow with a GPU.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you have the following. A computer with at least an Intel i5 or comparable multi-core CPU with 16GB of RAM (more is better), a discrete NVIDIA GPU card comparable to the NVIDIA GTX 1080 or better with 8GB of RAM, and a Solid State Drive (SSD) with sufficient space for your data.\r\n\r\nFor the operating system we recommend Ubuntu 64 bit Linux version 16.x or later. A 64 bit operating system is needed for large amounts of RAM to be usable by the operating system and applications.\r\n\r\nTensorFlow is multi-threaded which means it will use a multi-core CPU effectively. This implies that if you are using DeepLabCut with CPU, as opposed to GPU, then the choice of a multi-core CPU is preferred with the more cores on the CPU the better. See [How-to run TensorFlow on multiple core and threads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39415263/how-to-run-tensorflow-on-multiple-core-and-threads). Currently, AMD CPUs are a bit cheaper than Intel and the more expensive versions have more cores than the Intel line of CPUs.\r\n\r\nWhile the CPU choice between Intel and AMD is not as important for using DeepLabCut with GPU, using an NVIDIA GPU rather than an AMD Radeon GPU is preferred as NVIDIA supports TensorFlow better and it is the preferred GPU by the TensorFlow community.\r\n\r\nEach type of NVIDIA GPU has an assigned Compute Capacity score with a higher number being better because it is faster. The Compute Capacity score is derived from the type of processor used in the NVIDIA GPU which NVIDIA has improved over the years just as Intel and AMD have improved their CPUs. Older NVIDIA GPUs have a lower Compute Capacity score so will not process data as quickly.\r\n\r\nThe other consideration for the GPU is the amount of RAM that is on the GPU card. The amount of RAM is a limiting factor on the size and complexity of machine learning processing with more RAM being better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/592057502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RichardChambers","id":11844326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQ0MzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11844326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardChambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardChambers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3078571330,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA3ODU3MTMzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3078571330","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-27T16:41:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3078571334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNzg1NzEzMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/3078571334","actor":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-27T16:41:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/592092881","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596#issuecomment-592092881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/596","id":592092881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjA5Mjg4MQ==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T17:5
