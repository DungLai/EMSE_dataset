The `cropandlabel` by default crops to 400 by 400 (but if your images are smaller, perhaps you get your first error **a**.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is indeed important to create the trainingdataset on colab, but what happens when it runs cropandalablel is you will see your `video_path` in the `config.yaml` changed to append `_cropped.mp4` (etc) which now links to a \"fake\" video. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, what you need to do is:\r\n\r\n(1) fix you config.yaml file back to the original state. You will see at the very bottom, the \"original video_set\" is there, so just copy/paste back to the top. \r\n\r\n(2) run cropandlabel and create-training-set on COLAB (here is a WIP notebook from me - it work through training you can use; you can then, if your images are smaller than 400 x 400 pixels, edit the crop boundaries to be smaller: i.e., edit `size=(400, 400)` to something smaller than your images. Hope that helps!\r\n\r\nEdit to add the notebook is now in the main repo:

you so much for your fast response! I really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nI created a new project today using the GUI to avoid any potential concerns with changing the file names back incorrectly. The original file names were not listed at the bottom of the config file from yesterday, there was only a set of open curly brackets {}. \r\n\r\nMy frame dimensions in the config file (from today) after cropping during manual frame extraction are (339, 905, 37, 322). I tried editing the crop boundaries in the cropimagesandlabels function on the colab script with a range of smaller values going down to (10,10) without any success.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I noticed in the output of the error message with the cropimagesandlabels function on the colab script is that the video path from my config file is being inserted into the path, which then states that the concatenated path does not exist. Could this be part of the problem? \r\n\r\nImage A shows the videofile path specified in the colab script. \r\n![A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65971162/83061781-88f4bd80-a02b-11ea-82cd-bfb4c7feb44d.PNG)\r\n\r\nImage B shows the error message when running the cropandlabels function in colab.\r\n![B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65971162/83061438-f6ecb500-a02a-11ea-9aa8-57cd175bd06e.png)\r\n\r\nImage C shows the video path in the config file. \r\n![C](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65971162/83061452-fd7b2c80-a02a-11ea-97f6-585e54651dc7.PNG)\r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions on how to fix this error!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/634876169/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Kat-8-S","id":65971162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTcxMTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65971162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S","html_url":"https://github.com/Kat-8-S","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kat-8-S/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/634881307","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/704#issuecomment-634881307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/704","id":634881307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDg4MTMwNw==","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-27T19:13:12Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T19:16:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"oh.... this is a windows to linux issue!
