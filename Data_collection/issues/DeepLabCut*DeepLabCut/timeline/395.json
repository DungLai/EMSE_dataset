I did figure it out this morning. Apparently there is an issue with the version of Ipython that is installed with the pip command (pip install deeplabcut). \r\n\r\nI had to update to the most recently version of Ipython and update also numpy since it was giving some errors with tensorflow-gpu 1.14. \r\n\r\nBut problem solved.
