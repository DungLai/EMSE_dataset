I.e. annotate data train and then use this network for months on experimental data until there are some outliers, that then can be added to the training data. Thus one would only train every month or so. That said, you can also start from intermediate snapshots, so training can be as fast as 1h on a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can describe your use case more, so I can understand why you are interested in improving training speed. \r\n\r\nWe are, however, actively working on making inference faster and we will release an update for this next week. Stay tuned...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/431683169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1916730233,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkxNjczMDIzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1916730233","actor":{"login":"kebwi","id":1440529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDA1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1440529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi","html_url":"https://github.com/kebwi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-21T16:31:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1916730234,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5MTY3MzAyMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1916730234","actor":{"login":"kebwi","id":1440529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDA1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1440529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi","html_url":"https://github.com/kebwi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kebwi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-21T16:31:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1920866106,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkyMDg2NjEwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/events/1920866106","actor":{"login":"AlexEMG","id":20850270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUwMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20850270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexEMG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexEMG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-23T15:27:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
