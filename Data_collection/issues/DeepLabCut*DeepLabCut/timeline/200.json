Lets for simplicity only consider one direction (because all others are essentially the same). In a given iteration a random body part is picked, then a number is picked uniformly from (minsize, minsize+ rightwidth). Then the image is cropped with this number as an upper, right boundary. \r\n\r\nA few things should be considered:\r\n- if this is larger than the image itself, then there is no **cropping (or padding)** \r\n- from the body part the cropping will be at least \"minsize\" away. This makes sure that he cropped parts are not too small (and still contain visual + geometric information about other bodyparts)\r\n\r\nBtw:\r\nhttps://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/887814e960ef70d193745c9716c1cf9a871abe33/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/default_config.py\r\n\r\nhas a description:\r\n```\r\n#Parameters for augmentation with regard to cropping\r\ncfg.crop = False\r\ncfg.cropratio= 0.25 #what is the fraction of training samples with cropping?\r\ncfg.minsize= 100\t#what is the minimal frames size for cropping plus/minus ie..
