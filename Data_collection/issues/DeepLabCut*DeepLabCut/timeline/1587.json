You could create a python file (say \"script.py\"), with the following code:\r\n```python\r\nimport deeplabcut\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(\r\n    r'D:\\Users\\multi_dlc\\Desktop\\project1\\multi2-CJ-2021-11-18\\config.yaml',\r\n    r'D:\\Users\\multi_dlc\\Desktop\\vid\\behavCam1.avi',\r\n    track_method=\"ellipse\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\nand run `python script.py` from your terminal. If it works this way, we'll know it was something related to the jupyter environment
