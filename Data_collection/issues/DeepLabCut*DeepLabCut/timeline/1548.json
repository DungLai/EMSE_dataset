Thanks for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nThe pip installation works great! Thank you for making that easy!\r\n\r\nI understand that the \"full project management GUI\" experience is critical to your users. I do not want to take that away in the slightest (I would also be happy to help on that front too looking into the problems I am facing here I found a few places that could use touchups on the GUI front that I am happy to contribute).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as soon as we `import deeplabcut` into an other workflow that might want to use a different backend for matplotlib (for some interactive plotting), the statements in the `__init__.py` change which backend is used and causes very strange behavior. \r\n\r\nPlease see the attached screenshot where a user may want to use matplotlib in a jupyter notebook, but gets strange behavior as soon as they introduce deeplabcut into their analysis pipeline.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90008/137631595-f1bc5db1-ad19-4968-9b15-696115d3da72.png)\r\n\r\nThis leads to rather tricky behavior (bugs or \"features\") to debug.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `try: expect` statement to attempt to detect the wx library is also rather difficult to deal with when working in a larger project. It means that the selected backend of the library now might \r\n\r\nI understand that your users are often running deeplabcut with the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -m deeplabcut\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand how critical this is.\r\n\r\nI can help ensure that this workflow remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nMost of what it will involve is delaying the calls:\r\n```\r\n    import wx\r\n\r\n    mpl.use(\"WxAgg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the desired entry points of the GUI.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't \"easy\" and there are likely many knock-on effects that I cannot appreciate easily. However, if you are willing to review a few targetted PRs, I would be glad to make them.\r\n\r\nThank you again for considering.\r\n\r\n* [deeplabcut_as_library_issues.zip](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/files/7360101/deeplabcut_as_library_issues.zip) <---- notebook file compressed in zip demonstrating a possible issue.\r\n.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/945135057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hmaarrfk","id":90008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk","html_url":"https://github.com/hmaarrfk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmaarrfk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/945145574","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1548#issuecomment-945145574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1548","id":945145574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB5BM6c44Vcbm","user":{"login":"MMathisLab","id":28102185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28102185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab","html_url":"https://github.com/MMathisLab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMathisLab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-17T15:31:53Z","updated_at":"2021-10-17T15:31:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for the further info!\r\n\r\n> However, if you are willing to review a few targetted PRs, I would be glad to make them.\r\n - great, understood, and def. happy to improve this/ review PRs, thanks for the offer!\r\n\r\nAlso just to give you a roadmap, we are dropping wxPython soon (by early Q1 of 2022) - it's been a pain for years, the alpha replacement demo is here, if you want to use (then just use dlc headless) in the meantime: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/napari-DeepLabCut.
