tried running the testscript.py and had the known error found here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1106 . \r\nIt was resolved by following the conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg advice. \r\nThen I got a new error similar to this one: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1265 . And so now I am stuck trying to upgrade the deeplabcut version from â€˜2.1.10.4â€™ to â€˜2.2rc1â€™. \r\nAfter upgrading to 2.2rc1 using pip install and trying to import deeplabcut, then I get what is shown in the screenshot below.\r\nI've also tried running ./reinstall.sh file, but it didn't work for windows so I've also tried directly running the following:\r\npip uninstall deeplabcut \r\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\r\npip install C:\\Users\\LabMi\\Documents\\GitHub\\DeepLabCut\\dist\\deeplabcut-2.2rc1-py3-none-any.whl \r\nHowever, I get the same error with import deeplabcut\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\nIâ€™ve tried upgrading different ways, but I always get the same error.\r\nHas someone been able to install deeplabcut on windows 10 and can show their steps for an updated clean walk through, with or without gpu?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71452451/120266584-3e2a0900-c270-11eb-85b9-dc6b9ea9ef84.png)\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/comments/854009247","html_url":"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1265#issuecomment-854009247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/1265","id":854009247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDAwOTI0Nw==","user":{"login":"lachioma","id":29898879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29898879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma","html_url":"https://github.com/lachioma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachioma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-03T16:32:04Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T16:32:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had the same issue but I could fix it.\r\n\r\nI freshly installed DLC-GPU.
