Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nDear DLC team,\r\n\r\nI have a different issue following #1626 for single point  tracking. \r\n\r\nI also used maDLC to track a single animal (fly) and its interaction with food. Since v2.2.0.3  starts to support single point tracking, I also just labeled fly as \"individual 1\" with only 1 body part and the food dot as a stable object. \r\n\r\nAfter analyzing the video (tracker method: box), I first checked the video generated for detection before building tracklet. It did a perfect job which can stably track the fly dot and food dot (fly and food are always present in the video). However, after \"convert to tracklets\" and \"create tracks\", I saw following error saying that \"tracklets are empty\". \r\n\r\nI have seen this error before when I was analyzing other videos which have multiple animals with multiple bodyparts, but that seems only happen when there are no (or very few) animals present in the video. \r\n\r\nI am just wondering if there is any change of parameter may help this single-point tracking to build the tracklet and get the (x,y) csv file. \r\n\r\nThanks and happy new year.  \r\n\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\n2.2.0.3\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nmulti animal\n\n### Device type\n\nRTX 2080Ti\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn analyze video (GUI), I selected the video I used for training to analyze, and specify the videotype and tracker method (box), \"No\" for \"calibrate animal assembly and identity only\". \r\n\r\nThe inference_config is default:\r\nboundingboxslack: 0\r\niou_threshold: 0.6\r\nmax_age: 1\r\nmethod: m1\r\nmin_hits: 1\r\nminimalnumberofconnections: 1\r\npafthreshold: 0.1\r\npcutoff: 0.1\r\ntopktoretain: 2\r\nvariant: 0\r\nwithid: false\r\n\r\nIn \"refine tracklets\", the specified shuffle and trainingset index is default as \"1\" and \"0\" respectively.  \r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nStarting to analyze %  E:\\flytrack-LJ-2021-12-27\\videos\\flyvideo.mp4\r\nLoading  E:\\flytrack-LJ-2021-12-27\\videos\\flyvideo.mp4\r\nDuration of video [s]:  600.0 , recorded with  29.97 fps!\r\nOverall # of frames:  17982  found with (before cropping) frame dimensions:  416 416\r\nStarting to extract posture from the video(s) with batchsize: 32\r\n17985it [01:44, 172.59it/s]\r\nVideo Analyzed.

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Bug description\n\nHi DLC team, \r\n\r\nI encountered the same error as #1626 .\r\nHowever, it behaves a little differently.\r\n\r\nIf you analyze_video to the original video used for learning, .csv, .h5, .pickle files will be output.\r\nHowever, when I try to apply to other videos, only .csv files are output and there are no .h5, .pickle files.\r\nI get <code>FileNotFoundError: No unfiltered data file found</code> and <code>ValueError: Unrecognized track_method=</code>\r\n\r\nAlso, strangely, you can apply to videos shot with iphone, but you cannot apply to videos shot with GoProb on same config.yaml. \r\nOnly csv files will appear.\r\nIs it still an encoding problem like #1626 \r\nIf so, can you tell me a good way to re-encode?\r\n\r\nThank you\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows10\n\n### DeepLabCut version\n\ndeeplabcut==2.2.1\n\n### DeepLabCut mode\n\nsingle animal\n\n### Device type\n\nGPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. labeling, traning and evaluate network is OK\r\n2. analyze video\r\n    - save csv -> yes\r\n    - save nwb -> yes\r\n    - filter prediction -> no\r\n    - dynamically crop bodyparts -> no\r\n    - plots to pop up -> no\r\n    - plot trajectory -> yes\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nStarting GUI...\r\nUsing snapshot-200000 for
