@jdabbi - I went ahead and tried to install on my Macbook Pro... I did not use Anaconda, I did a direct install on my MacBook. (Using Anaconda is more difficult to get wxPython support...*)\r\n\r\nMacOS Sierra - version 10.12.16\r\nLaunch Terminal, then:\r\n\r\nTo install wxPython you can use homebrew: http://macappstore.org/wxpython/\r\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null\r\n``brew install wxpython``\r\nand/or: ``pip install wxpython``\r\n*NOTE: You may have to troubleshoot wxPython a bit to get it to work, depending on how you installed python, and especially if you are using Anaconda. See more here:\r\nhttps://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMac_\r\n\r\nconda install python.app\r\n\r\nthen, ``pip install tensorflow==1.10``\r\n\r\n``git clone https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut``\r\n\r\ngo to this folder:\r\n``cd DeepLabCut`` \r\n\r\nstart python: \r\n``pythonw`` <--- *using **pythonw** I had  no issues with GUIS, i.e. wxPython! (see more here: https://docs.python.org/2/using/mac.html) \r\n\r\n``import deeplabcut`` (we are building directly from this git cloned folder then... but, I also tried pip install deeplabcut without issues...) I got no errors and intel-openmp installed fine...\r\n![screen shot 2018-11-10 at 5 29 45 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/48307125-864b7980-e514-11e8-9599-064723e3a9a7.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the GUI wasn't designed for Mac, so the spacing is wide (this can be fixed); Maybe for now use an external monitor, as I couldn't see all the labels in my little macbook screen. I will keep this as a \"to do\" in the future, but at least for now, DeepLabCut **does work on MacOS** (although I will continue to advocate for users to use Ubuntu :).
