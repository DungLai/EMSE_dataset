If they look similar, then it generalizes very well. If it does not, that is why provide you with [refinement tools ](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#j-optional-active-learning---network-refinement-extract-outlier-frames) for you to augment the dataset with data that is  similar to the novel videos. We discuss this in the [Nature Neuroscience paper](https://t.co/Grkqck2tka); i.e. we labeled 10,80 frames and show that with even 50 you can get great performance on unseen mice in a simple lab setting (what DeepLabCut is designed for). We also discuss this in the [Nature Protocols paper](https://rdcu.be/bHpHN) about the cheetah dataset, which is much more complicated... \r\n\r\nAlso, **please post questions** on [Image Forum](https://forum.image.sc/tags/deeplabcut), **not** on github, which is only for code bug reports.
