I figured it out but it doesn't make much sense to me. If I run hflip and then vlip on that hflipped video, it saves the video in the original orientation but for some reason imports into DLC in this orientation as well.

It's very curious because the frames extracted from the videos are oriented correctly, but the frames in the output video are inverted. I suspect inference is also happening on inverted images too, as the tracking performance is very poor.\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut 2.2.2\r\nopencv-python version 4.6.0.66 (although a possible issue is whether frames were extracted with a different set of libraries)\r\n\r\nI've run into similar issues in my own code when using video acquired on smartphones due to variations in handling of the rotation metadata. I suspect this is the case for these videos. I've attached the results from ffprobe below, which shows that despite being portrait they have metadata indicating they are rotated (bolded). I've seen quirks between libraries where the rotation is handled backward, which can create the inversion like I'm seeing (which isn't addressed with a hflip or vflip, but requires simply reencoding it without any rotation since ffmpeg handles it correctly).\r\n\r\n@MMathisLab  TL;DR: does DLC use a different video reader library to extract the files for annotation compared to running inference? If you point me at the difference I can try and offer a PR to handle the metadata more robustly.\r\n\r\n> ffprobe \"112006_36wk_3 copy.MOV\"\r\nffprobe version 5.1.1 Copyright (c) 2007-2022 the FFmpeg
