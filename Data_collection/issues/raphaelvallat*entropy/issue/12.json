The ability to calculate join entropies would allow the calculation of additional information measures such as mutual information and conditional mutual information. \r\n\r\nThe [entropy_estimators](https://github.com/paulbrodersen/entropy_estimators/blob/master/entropy_estimators/continuous.py#L276) package, which is estimating entropy using a k-nearest-neighbor approach, calculates the joint entropy of X, Y by concatenating their values with `np.c_[x, y]`. This doesn't apply here because the inputs are all coerced into a 0-dimensional vector, and this approach likely doesn't make sense outside of the k-nearest neighbor approach. Is there an alternate way to think about joint entropies with respect to these estimators? In particular, I'm working with the approximate, sample, and permutation entropies.
