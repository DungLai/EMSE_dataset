I have a small question regarding your implementation below of ApEn:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/raphaelvallat/entropy/blob/77ba71e5039ae2cc4e7876cd1803db20251b36ad/entropy/entropy.py#L254\r\n\r\n```\r\nif approximate:\r\n        emb_data1 = _emb_data1\r\n    else:\r\n        emb_data1 = _emb_data1[:-1]\r\n```\r\nIt seems like here the last vector in the embedded time-series is removed if approximate is False (sample entropy). However, I couldn't find the rationale for this particular removal. Would really appreciate it if you could point me to the right direction.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nTam","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
