You'd get way more users, starting by me. Handling packages manually is not practical by any means. Your code is way harder to use in production than it would be on PyPi.\r\n\r\nThat's just a suggestion, great work on the package !","closed_by":{"login":"raphaelvallat","id":25703792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzAzNzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25703792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat","html_url":"https://github.com/raphaelvallat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphaelvallat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
