I recommend all users to switch to the new package, which can be installed with `pip install antropy`. The current EntroPy package will be progressively deprecated over the next few weeks / months.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raphaelvallat/entropy/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
