@MaxHeuillet!\r\n\r\nOk for the periodogram, could you say a bit more why you think it's unstable and what exactly you would put in the documentation (or please feel free to submit a PR). As for the sampling frequency, why would you put it to 1 Hz? I think it's much better to not use a default value, instead, users should know the sampling frequency of their data.
