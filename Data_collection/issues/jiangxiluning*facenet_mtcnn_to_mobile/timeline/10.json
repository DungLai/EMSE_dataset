as far as I know, the MTCNN detection pipeline involves 3 stages (pnet, rnet, onet). pnet does some rough processing and hands over the results (areas in the input image where faces are potentially present) to rnet. rnet further refines the results and pass them off to onet. Onet finally determines which of the proposed regions contains actual faces, and outputs the bounding box and face probabilities.\r\nSo, you have to actually implement the MTCNN 3-stage pipeline and use the 3 .tflite files to load parameters into pnet, rnet, and onet (which isn't really a trivial process)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jiangxiluning/facenet_mtcnn_to_mobile/issues/comments/646957936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Unturned3","id":36037753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDM3NzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36037753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3","html_url":"https://github.com/Unturned3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unturned3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
