The loss is implemented by Keras and the model will fit both towers at the same time, the loss function should be y0_loss + y1_loss which both are MSE losses. Also for the loss function, you can assign coefficients to each part of the loss if you want, please check out Keras's [implementation](https://keras.io/models/model/ ) (`loss_weights` parameter in the `compile` method).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/comments/562192375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alvin319","id":909071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/909071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319","html_url":"https://github.com/alvin319","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2907435428,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkwNzQzNTQyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/events/2907435428","actor":{"login":"alvin319","id":909071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/909071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319","html_url":"https://github.com/alvin319","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-25T01:43:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
