Both MMoE and tower layer s are single layers in this example. There are 8 experts and 4 hidden units per expert and the number of task here is basically defining how many gate kernels I need to use to weight all of the experts. Of course, the tower layers are just standard Dense layers in Keras and you can modify it pretty easily.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/comments/554524564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alvin319","id":909071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/909071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319","html_url":"https://github.com/alvin319","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvin319/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2803959045,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgwMzk1OTA0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/events/2803959045","actor":{"login":"neil-yc","id":14822992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIyOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14822992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc","html_url":"https://github.com/neil-yc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-15T20:54:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2803959046,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MDM5NTkwNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/events/2803959046","actor":{"login":"neil-yc","id":14822992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIyOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14822992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc","html_url":"https://github.com/neil-yc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-15T20:54:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/comments/554833469","html_url":"https://github.com/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/3#issuecomment-554833469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drawbridge/keras-mmoe/issues/3","id":554833469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDgzMzQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"neil-yc","id":14822992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODIyOTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14822992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc","html_url":"https://github.com/neil-yc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil-yc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T03:17:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T03:17:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thx
