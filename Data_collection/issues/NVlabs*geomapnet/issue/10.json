After setting up the environment as this repo describes, I train MapNet on `loop` dataset from scratch by running\r\n```python\r\npython train.py --dataset RobotCar --scene loop --config_file configs/mapnet.ini --model mapnet --device 0 --learn_beta --learn_gamma\r\n```\r\nAfter that, I get the model `logs/RobotCar_loop_mapnet_mapnet_learn_beta_learn_gamma/epoch_300.pth.tar ` and evaluate the model on `loop` but the result seems not as good as the paper reported. Do you have any suggestions?\r\n```bash\r\n$ python eval.py --dataset RobotCar --scene loop --config_file configs/mapnet.ini --model mapnet --weights logs/RobotCar_loop_mapnet_mapnet_learn_beta_learn_gamma/epoch_300.pth.tar --val --output_dir ../results/\r\n\r\n../dataset_loaders/robotcar_sdk/interpolate_poses.py:143: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide\r\n  (pose_timestamps[upper_indices] - pose_timestamps[lower_indices])\r\nLoaded weights from logs/RobotCar_loop_mapnet_mapnet_learn_beta_learn_gamma/epoch_300.pth.tar\r\nRunning mapnet on VAL data\r\n../common/train.py:339: UserWarning: volatile was removed and now has no effect.
