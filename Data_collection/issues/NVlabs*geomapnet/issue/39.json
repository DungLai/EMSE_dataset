It just happens when I set beta and gamma to a negative value (default is -3) and activate the learning of both.\r\nI also do not understand why beta and gamma are explained as translation and rotation balance weights in the paper, but in the code they are \"saq\" and \"srq\", which mean the absolute rotation weight and the relative rotation weight. \r\nBeta and gamma seem to get more negative without a lower bound in the training which also makes the loss more negative.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
