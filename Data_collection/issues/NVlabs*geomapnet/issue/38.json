It is fantastic. However, I repeated three times, starting all over again (without resume checkpoint), training 0 to 100 epochs with mapnet, and using eval.py to test the trained model.\r\n\r\n  In theory, I train in strict accordance with the provided experimental parameters and compiling environment. The three pieces of training are completely independent and do not affect each other.  \r\n  So the test results (for example, using eval.py to test the 100_epoch.pth.tar of the first, second, and third training respectively), the results should be almost the same. \r\n  Unfortunately, the trained model (e.g. epoch_100.pth.tar) obtained in the second time's training **gave an obviously larger error** than that from the first-time's training. So do the third-time's results comparing with the second and the first time's ones. \r\n\r\nI feel very confused. I'd like to ask for your opinion. Your suggestion will be very helpful to me. Thank you in advance!\r\n\r\nBest\r\nJialu","closed_by":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
