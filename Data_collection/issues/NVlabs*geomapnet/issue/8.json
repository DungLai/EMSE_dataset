I am wondering how can DSO be executed in the first place because there is no camera intrinsics for the RGB images in the 7-scenes dataset. The bad camera trajectory could be due to the wrong camera intrinsics.\r\n\r\nIf you have the RGB camera intrinsics, please let us know. AFAIK, the RGB-D 7-scenes authors do not share the parameters.
