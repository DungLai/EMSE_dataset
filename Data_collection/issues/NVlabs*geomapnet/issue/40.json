I had 2 queries:\r\n\r\n1. From the ground truth files of **7Scenes** and the reference paper, and the code of the **RobotCar** dataset, it seems the label format required is a **Camera Pose Matrix** (for the **common.pose_utils.process_poses** method)? I wanted to confirm this since my own ground truth contains **[X Y Z W P Q R]** where X, Y, Z are the position coordinates and W, P, Q, R the quaternions for each image. \r\n\r\n2. Apart from creating ones own dataloader and adding it to **composite.py**, are there any other scripts that need some addition of code/changes. I feel **scripts/train.py** and **common/train.py** also need changes but are there any other ones?\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
