Or it is ok to use the pre-computed one in your code?\r\n\r\n\r\n\tQ2:\r\nAccording to your home page, scripts/align_vo_poses.py. must be run to generate those xx_vo_stats.pkl files before using VO in MapNet++ training. \r\nIf I **only want to train and test the mapnet module**, will those xx_vo_stats.pkl files be used? Do I still need to use run align_vo_poses.py to generate them? \r\n\r\n\tQ3:\r\n  According to your [comment ](https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/26#issuecomment-537523192), 'For each day (e.g. DAY=2014-05-14-13-46-12) you should download DAY_stereo_center.tar and DAY_vo.tar from the Bumblebee XB3 section, and DAY_gps.tar from the GPS/INS section.' \r\n  However, I found **multiple** stereo_centre.tar files from the full sequence (for 2014-11-28-12-07-13, **there are 6 si,ilar files stereo_centre_01.tar ~ stereo_centre_06.tar** ). **Which one should I download for your code?** Or any one of it would be fine? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nBest wishes！\r\nJialu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jialuwang123321","id":58662114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYyMTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58662114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321","html_url":"https://github.com/jialuwang123321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jialuwang123321/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
