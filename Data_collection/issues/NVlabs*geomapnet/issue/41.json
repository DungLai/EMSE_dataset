MapNet ensures global consistency via its clever relative loss. I'm just having hardtime grasping intuitively why a value of skip defaults to 10. It is a hyperparam and for sure can be optimized but you providing it as the default must mean you had good results for that value. \r\n\r\nTo that extent, skip=10 means if the dataloader picks an index of say 36, given steps=3, the loader would pick the images indexed: [26, 36, 46] with a gap of 10 images. \r\n\r\nBut doesn't it mean you're picking images which are farther apart chronologically, and thus also in translation. (a person collecting the data moving at 1m/sec means the 3 images would be 10 meters apart, so we loose the point of relative loss).\r\n\r\nActually I trained my own model with the default hyperparams and then with skip=1 and I got poorer results so I wanted to clarify the intent of how the images are paired for the loss in case I misunderstand.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","closed_by":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
