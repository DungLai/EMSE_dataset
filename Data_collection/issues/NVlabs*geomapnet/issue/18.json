Learning rate still too big?\r\n2. The parameter of skip is too small? (Because my robot move slow)\r\n3. Data repeatability is too high (It means the image is too close but the poses are different because the path of my training data is close)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34086087/59541522-4201db00-8f34-11e9-9719-d1d821415dc4.png)\r\n\r\nFollowing is the Ground Truth of my training data\r\nwhich do you think is the problem\r\nI really need your help\r\nthanks","closed_by":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
