This matrix `wTc` transforms points from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system: `wX = wTc @ cX`.\r\n\r\n\"raw pose\" in the docstring of `pose_utils.process_poses()` means this `wTc` matrix. And I also call this matrix as \"camera pose\" in my earlier comment.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/854970503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4845013594,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDg0NTAxMzU5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/4845013594","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T20:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4845013597,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4NDUwMTM1OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/4845013597","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T20:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/855671676","html_url":"https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/19#issuecomment-855671676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/19","id":855671676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTY3MTY3Ng==","user":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T07:29:47Z","u
