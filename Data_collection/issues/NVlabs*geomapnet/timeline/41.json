This is true both from the camera pose as well as motions of dynamic objects in the scene. So it might not provide a strong learning signal, because anyway the network will predict a similar pose (since the input images are almost the same).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you connect two far-away images with the relative loss, it provides a stronger learning signal. For example, the network's prediction might jump by a large amount between two images 10 frames apart (let's say because of the large image change from the motion of a dynamic object like a car, or the sudden brightness change from the appearance of a new light).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if `skip` is set to a very large separation, then the two images will not have any overlap in their view frustums.\r\n\r\nSo `skip` needs to be a compromise between all these considerations, and good `skip` values are also likely to be different for different datasets.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/886110735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5064381507,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTA2NDM4MTUwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/5064381507","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-24T20:59:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5064381508,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUwNjQzODE1MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/5064381508","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-24T20:59:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/889779145","html_url":"https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/41#issuecomment-889779145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/41","id":889779145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB6g85841CPPJ","user":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-30T09:52:42Z","updated_at":"2021-07-
