Samarth,\r\n\r\nit seems those intrinsics are for the depth camera. I assume the intrinsics for the RGB camera should be different as the provided RGB images have different field of view as the depth images. I assume the provided GT poses are also for the depth camera.\r\n\r\nBesides, the RGB images are captured by rolling shutter camera (Kinect) which might also be problematic for DSO.\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to the 7Scenes dataset. It would be great if somebody seeing this could share some information on the RGB camera, e.g., are the RGB camera intrinsics and the relative pose between the RGB and depth cameras mentioned in some following up projects or papers?
