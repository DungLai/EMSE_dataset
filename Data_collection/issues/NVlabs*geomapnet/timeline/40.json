The important thing is to ensure that your dataset loader converts the pose to a standard 4x4 homogeneous transform matrix, take the first 3 rows and flatten it row-wise to make a 12-element vector. This is given as `poses_in` to `process_poses()`. \r\n\r\nI have written down some information [in `dataset_loaders/README.md`](https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/tree/master/dataset_loaders#readme). Because some time has passed since I last used this code, it is difficult for me to provide more information unless you post specific error messages along with what you have tried.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/854963458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4844963951,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDg0NDk2Mzk1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/4844963951","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T19:49:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4844963954,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ4NDQ5NjM5NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/4844963954","actor":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T19:49:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/855672398","html_url":"https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/40#issuecomment-855672398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/40","id":855672398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTY3MjM5OA==","user":{"login":"AntiLibrary5","id":48105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiLibrary5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiLibrary5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-07T07:30:42Z","updated
