In that equation, `poses_mat` is a list of absolute poses w.r.t. some world coordinate system `w`.\r\n\r\nDenote the i-th frame by `w_T_i`. So for each frame `i`, it is solving the equation `w_T_0 X = w_T_i` for `X`.\r\n\r\nThe answer is obviously `X = inv(w_T_0) * w_T_i = 0_T_i` i.e. the pose of the i-th frame not w.r.t. world `w`, but the 0th frame. Essentially it is transforming the whole trajectory such that the first pose is identity.\r\n\r\nThey could have done this in a for loop, but chose to speed it up by using `np.linalg.solve()`'s fast linear algebra.\r\n\r\nThe above was an explanation of what that line does. I don't remember exactly why I am not using it, but inside my own code I subtract the mean of the poses of the whole trajectory, so that has a similar effect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/1101979483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samarth-robo","id":2848070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDgwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2848070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo","html_url":"https://github.com/samarth-robo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarth-robo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":6451790243,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB6g8585H464_zwAAAAGAjoGj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/6451790243","actor":{"login":"LZL-CS","id":54640259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQwMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54640259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS","html_url":"https://github.com/LZL-CS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T04:19:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6451790246,"node_id":"SE_lADOB6g8585H464_zwAAAAGAjoGm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/events/6451790246","actor":{"login":"LZL-CS","id":54640259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQwMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54640259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS","html_url":"https://github.com/LZL-CS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T04:19:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/comments/1101995016","html_url":"https://github.com/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/45#issuecomment-1101995016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NVlabs/geomapnet/issues/45","id":1101995016,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB6g8585BrxwI","user":{"login":"LZL-CS","id":54640259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQwMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54640259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS","html_url":"https://github.com/LZL-CS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LZL-CS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T04:29:30Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T04:29:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
