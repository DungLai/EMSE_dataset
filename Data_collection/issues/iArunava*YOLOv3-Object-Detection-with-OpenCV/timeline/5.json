this YOLOv3 tutorial may help you: \r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data\r\n\r\nThe accompanying repository works on MacOS, Windows and Linux, includes multigpu and multithreading, performs inference on images, videos, webcams, and an iOS app. It also tests to slightly higher mAPs than darknet, including on the latest `YOLOv3-SPP.weights` (**60.7 COCO mAP**), and offers the ability to train custom datasets from scratch to darknet performance, all using PyTorch :)\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\r\n  <tr><th><img
