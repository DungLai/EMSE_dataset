having the same issue, tried casting as you suggested:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef show_image(img):\r\n#     img = cv.UMat(img)\r\n    cv.imshow('Image', img)\r\n    cv.waitKey(0)\r\n```\r\n>TypeError: Required argument 'ranges' (pos 2) not found\r\n\r\nI'm reading the documentation on UMat() but I'm unsure if that's actually the culprit. \r\n\r\nStrangely, I'm able to get it working\r\nIn testing I merged the yolo_utils.py with yolo.py, and hardcoded the default flags to point to the paths. \r\n\r\nI commented out the call to show_image()\r\n```\r\n\t\tfinally:\r\n\t\t\timg = infer_image(net, layer_names, height, width, img, colors, labels, FLAGS)\r\n# \t\t\tshow_image(img)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen added these lines to the end of of the script, using your existing functions.\r\n```\r\nimg = cv2.imread(r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\testImage.jpg\")\r\n\r\n#rewrite with fieldnames\r\nblob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image=img, scalefactor=1.0/255.0, size=(416,416), mean=None, swapRB=True,
