The compute capabilities should be around the same for these two SoCs right? \r\n\r\nFor example mobilenetsv2 benchmark runs at `~10ms` for `sdm845` and `47.597ms` for `kirin970` (optimized). I also see big differences in my custom model. On a `sdm845` I get around `75ms`, while on `kirin980` I get around `250ms`.\r\n\r\nIs it because snapdragon is actually that much faster, or because of how Mace ops / kernels are implemented? If it's the latter, what would be a good place to start working on possible optimizations?\r\nWould you expect improvements if ARM Compute is used for ARM SoCs?","closed_by":{"login":"liyinhgqw","id":1586024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODYwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1586024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinhgqw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinhgqw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/XiaoMi/mobile-ai-bench/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/XiaoMi/mobile-ai-bench/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
