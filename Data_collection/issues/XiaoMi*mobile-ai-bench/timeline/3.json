We have successfully used CK-NNTest to optimize the Arm Compute Library for their latest GPU architecture (Bifrost), achieving up to 10x kernel-level speedups, up to 5x operator-level speedups and up to 3x network-level speedups (e.g. see our [ReQuEST@ASPLOS'18 paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3229767)).

That's why we are developing CK together with a growing community across industry and academia to avoid duplication of efforts and fragmentation.
