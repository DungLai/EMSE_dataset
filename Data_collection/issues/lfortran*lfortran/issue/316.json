The user can prevent the warning by specifying precision explicitly, as in:\n```fortran\n  real(dp), parameter :: const = 1.4435435345345_dp\n  real(dp), parameter :: const2 = 1./3._dp\n  real(dp), parameter :: const3 = 1./4._dp\n```\n\n\nRelated issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues/201","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
