It should contain:\n```\n\"Double\" 'Quote'\n'Single' \"Quote\"\n```\nThis should be fixed in the tokenizer itself, as it knows if single or double quotes were used for the string. It should just decode it, and keep it as a string.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/334/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
