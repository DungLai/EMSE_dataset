All symbols must be unique across all LLVM modules. See https://llvm.discourse.group/t/duplicate-symbols-in-separate-modules-no-longer-allowed/1805 for more details\n\n* We have to decide whether ASR or the LLVM backend should track of shadowing and rename the new subroutine/function appropriately in LLVM IR\n\n* The JIT can then be updated to the new LLVM API. See https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/610 how to do it.","closed_by":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
