As such we can't run it to pre-compile the runtime library modules. See https://github.com/conda-forge/lfortran-feedstock/issues/29.\n\nSome solutions that come to mind:\n\n* Compile lfortran twice: once cross-compiled to be included in the Conda package, and once on the host just to compile the runtime library\n* Pre-compile the runtime library at LFortran's CI and put it into the source tarball\n* Compile runtime library when lfortran is executed for the first time","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
