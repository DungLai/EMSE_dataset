That will require to store all the debugging information in the executable. We will have to investigate how to extend DWARF with all the semantic information that we need in order to represent all Fortran features.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
