Similar to f2py, but more robust. It will be able to generate the `iso_c_binding` wrappers and the corresponding `Cython` source code, so that it is easy to inspect the wrappers by hand.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
