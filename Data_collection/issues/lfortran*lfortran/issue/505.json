It seems to me we could use the usual `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3` to control LLVM optimizations, then we can have some kind of option to select individual passes (?) in LLVM.\n\nFinally, we need good control of ASR passes. Perhaps something like `--asr-passes=array_op,flip_sign,for_all`. You list passes in some order (even repeat them). That might be all we needed.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
