Actually I think it is one leading space and a field size of 12.\n\nI don't know if the standard requires the spaces or if it is up to the Fortran processor (compiler). This is in any case a difference between the behaviour of lfortran and gfortran so I thought I'd report it here.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
