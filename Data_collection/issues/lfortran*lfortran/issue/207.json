Or at least it could be used temporarily while LFortran catches up with it.\n\nI hope it can help save time and effort, which are better spent implementing the cool features that set LFortran apart from other compilers.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
