The\n\n```\nDetecting Fortran compiler ABI info - failed\n```\n\nmessage is a bit worrisome, but I'm not sure what it indicates. Also note that without faking the `-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID=LFort` flag, since `lfort` isn't among the [known (by CMake) compilers][1], the configure step prints\n\n```\n-- The Fortran compiler identification is unknown\n```\n\n----\n\nI feel like there is a CMake story already for this project since you use CMake to build `lfortran` (:fingers_crossed:). I'd be happy to help contribute to `docs.lfortran.org` if there is some recommended way to do build projects with CMake + `lfort`.\n\nCheers and thanks for this great project!\n\n[1]: https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/d31f31714bb0b4e027ed99998e5f90ebe52d9304/Modules/CMakeDetermineFortranCompiler.cmake#L46-L64","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
