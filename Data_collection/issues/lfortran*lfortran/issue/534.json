Run, `make`.\n6. You should see the above logs.\n\nReference - https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1689","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
