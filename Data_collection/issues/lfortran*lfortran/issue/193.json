It will forward it to a pipeline in a separate repository (it will forward the whole JSON payload to it via the user variables in the pipeline trigger). This separate repository's pipeline will then analyze the JSON, download the MR from lfortran/lfortran, downloads the MR git, and uploads to azure pipelines. This will get Azure pipelines running for each MR automatically.\n\nFinally, it would be nice to set the Azure build status also, and for that we can follow the same approach as in https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/75.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
