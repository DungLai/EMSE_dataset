That will ensure that all parts of LFortran fully work on those files (including the runtime library, linking, etc.). Then get other larger parts working.\n\nGood candidates to start:\n\n* [ ] `stats/statlib`: https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/581 \n* [ ] `optimize/slsqp`: https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/580","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
