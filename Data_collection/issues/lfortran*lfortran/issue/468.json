It does not compile because of some of the issues I reported earlier. I can compile both `kind.f90 util.f90 xutil.f90` and `kind.f90 util.f90 xxutil.f90` into executables with gfortran, g95, and Intel Fortran. The files are attached. Since they are proprietary I marked this issue confidential. When util.f90 can be compiled by LFortran I will be able to try it on hundreds of complete programs.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
