As we are passing `0.d0` (which seems to be of type `real`), the `dkind()` with the `real(8)` parameter should have been included.\n\nI guess, this is probably because of the following at https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/blob/main/src/runtime/pure/lfortran_intrinsic_kind.f90:\n```fortran\n! Does not work yet:\n!\n!interface kind\n!    module procedure skind, dkind, lkind\n!end interface\n```\n\nMore details (example source code, its `ASR`, etc.) at [comment](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/124#issuecomment-1211875635) and [comment](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/124#issuecomment-1211910302)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
