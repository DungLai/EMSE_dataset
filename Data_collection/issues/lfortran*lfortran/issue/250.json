Type mismatching, when CHARACTER string is trying to be outputted:\n```\nwrite (*,*) \"TEXT\"\n```\nThe error is:\n```\nType mismatch: LHS=_run3 (Integer()), RHS=<lfortran.ast.ast.Str object at 0x7fcb309ab090> (None)\n```\nAt the same time, `print *, \"TEXT\"` is working.\n\n2. Internal bug, it WRITE statement is in any construction. For example, in DO-ENDDO statement:\n```\ninteger i\ndo i = 1, 2\n  write (*,*) i\nend do\n```\nLong backtrace with the output in the end:\n```\nThis is an internal error in fortran_kernel, please send a bug report.\n```\nAt the same time, `print *,i` is working.\n3. WRITE statement unit is not working. I have tried to use different units for writing, and I failed with it: all outputs were in standard output [tested in Jupiter Notebook]. For example:\n```\nWRITE (10, *) 1\n```\n4. In Jupiter notebook, only the latest WRITE statement will be used for output. It means that the following code:\n```\nWRITE(*,*) 1\nWRITE(*,*) 3\n\n```\nprints just `3`.\n5. In continuing `4.`... WRITE statement is overwriting by PRINT statement:\n```\nWRITE (*, *) 1\nWRITE (*, *) 3\nprint *, 6\nprint *, 8\n```\nThe output will be only \n```\n6\n8\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
