Some remaining concerns:\n- The standard appears to accept any constant expression, which would include `ConstantComplex`\n- `e` needs to be checked for and handled\n\nThe relevant section for a Constant expression is quite long; see the ISO Fortran 2018 draft standard's section 10.1.12; p.g. 165.\n\nAdditionally, the standard defines the inquiry function KIND to accept arrays as well; which has not been tested.\n![image](/uploads/a8d347f578c89821644534c12443b8a1/image.png)\nThis a *low priority* issue though.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
