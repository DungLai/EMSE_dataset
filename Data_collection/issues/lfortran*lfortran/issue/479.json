So it will highlight all code across all files in the project.\n\nYou would run it on the main program. I can imagine there being multiple main programs, so one should probably run this across all main programs and ensure the code is not used in any of them.\n\nThis was first requested here: https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/identifying-unused-code-in-large-fortran-projects/2181","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
