It would stop all MPI ranks at the `call embed()` line, and attach to the first image in the command line. Then it would allow to use magics like `%%image_attach 3` to attach to image number 3.\n\nThat would allow to easily Debug a parallel code.\n\nLater, once https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/135 is implemented, one can extend that to handle parallel code also in a similar fashion.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
