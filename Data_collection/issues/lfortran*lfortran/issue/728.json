now the two are represented by exactly the same AST, but they are not the same. `complex*8` is equivalent to `complex(4)`.\r\n\r\nA test example:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram complex3\r\ncomplex*8 :: k\r\ncomplex(8) :: z\r\nprint *, kind(k)\r\nprint *, kind(z)\r\nend program\r\n```\r\nWhich should return:\r\n```console\r\ngfortran a.f90 && ./a.out\r\n           4\r\n           8\r\n```\r\nBut
