I tried to fix that by modifying the scipy's file by changing `IF (IPR2.GE.3. AND. LUNRPT.NE.LUDFLT)` to `IF (IPR2.GE.3 .AND. LUNRPT.NE.LUDFLT)` and it works fine then. After these changes, it was able to show the AST output.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
