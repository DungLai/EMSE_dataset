Here is an example:\n\n```\n$ cat examples/expr2.f90 \nprogram expr2\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: x\n\nx = (2+3)*5\nprint *, x\nprint *, sin(3.5)\n\nend program\n$ ./src/bin/lfortran examples/expr2.f90 \n$ ./a.out \n25\n-0.350783\n$ file a.out\na.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64\n$ otool -L a.out\na.out:\n\t[@ rpath](https://gitlab.com/rpath)/liblfortran_runtime.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)\n\t/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1292.60.1)\n```\nEven the runtime library got linked correctly. \n\nThe only issue I found is that the `re2c` program is missing in Conda on Apple Silicon, so that's why I had to use the release tarball.\n\nI will use this issue to document how to get things up and running and we should document it in our documentation.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
