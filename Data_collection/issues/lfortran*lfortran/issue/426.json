Or alternatively write an ASR pass that transforms the `open`, `write`, ..., statements into our Fortran runtime library calls.\n\nFirst reported in: https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/lfortran-exception-visit-read-not-implemented-error/1803","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
