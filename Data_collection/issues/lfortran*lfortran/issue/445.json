Those libraries have already been installed on your computer, and R knows where to look for them. It would be nice if you could compile source files containing modules with LFortran and then start an interactive session where you start with lines such as\n\n```\nuse m1\nuse m2\n```\n\nand then invoke procedures from those modules.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
