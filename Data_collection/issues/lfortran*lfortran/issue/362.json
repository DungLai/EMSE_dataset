Also, in the longer term, turning purity on and off while debugging causes some hassles typically and maybe there could be nice ways of doing that. In the short term, if some of the easiest to understand rules about purity were checked and then the most strict elemental/pure was added it would be nice.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
