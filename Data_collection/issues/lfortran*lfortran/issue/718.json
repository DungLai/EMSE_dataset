(The Union feature might have some additional implications how the struct is packed in memory, but that's a separate issue I think.)\r\n\r\nSo we need some design in ASR to allow variables to be stored at the same location in memory, and since we need the Union feature in LPython anyway, we should design the ASR to cover both Union and equivalence.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
