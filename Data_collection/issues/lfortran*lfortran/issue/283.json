Therefore we need to use the names of the library instead of CMake variables. - Will explain my point through a PR.\n- All build scripts should be merged into one for less confusion.\n- Separating the build directory and the code directory - Easy to fix, will require minor change in the build command. Removing `pwd` will work.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
