However we had a temporary limitation in LFortran that it didn't allow an `elsecs` variable and it turned out to be a bug in the source code, it was not intended to be such a variable. So LFortran could be giving warnings about such usage.\r\n\r\nIt might be quite a lot of work to actually implement such a warning, because the fixed-form prescanner drops all spaces, so that it is easier to handle in the fixed-form tokenizer. So by the time we notice it is a variable, we do not know if it had spaces in it or not. We would have to either figure out some way to do it, or fundamentally rework the fixed-form tokenizer.\r\n\r\nIt's a question whether it is worth investing into fixed-form, or rather use our resources to focus on free-form and only do the bare minimum needed for fixed-form so that LFortran can compile any older code.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/815/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
