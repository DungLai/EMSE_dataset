Our CI at `lfortran-recipe` will upload automatically, we can use [this](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/GitRelease.html#github.GitRelease.GitRelease.upload_asset) method from [PyGitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) to do so.\n\nI would like to upload the binary releases for every commit. Alternatively, we can just have some tag \"latest\" and keep overriding the binaries there with the latest commit. That would save some space if needed.\n\nAlso, there should be a nice webpage that provides the links, and tagged releases should have a section with links at https://lfortran.org/download/.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
