Especially for using as a formatter the preprocessor cannot be expanded prior to formatting the file and `lfortran` has to deal with a potentially incomplete representation of the source it tries to parse / format.\n\nWhat is the plan for this issue?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
