If the user types \"i = 3\", LFortran would infer that i is an integer. The type would be fixed once inferred, so that later typing \"i = 'foo'\" would cause a syntax error.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
