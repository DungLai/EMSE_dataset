That will allow to use the latest Fortran features (and even LFortran specific extensions such as the custom\n`use` extension https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/44) with any other Fortran compiler.\n\nThis is a similar approach that TypeScript uses, it is able to generate JavaScript that works in all browsers.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
