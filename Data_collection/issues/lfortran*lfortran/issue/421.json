For example, in an expression `a+b+c`, if `b` is a real pointer and `a` and `c` are not, what is the type of the result? My understanding is that the result is `real`, of the same `rank`, but it is unspecified whether it is a pointer or not --- to be exact, an expression is always a `value`. Rather, when you write `r = a+b+c`, then you lookup if `r` is a pointer and if so, dereference `r` first before assigning. Just to make sure, I asked at https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/is-a-variable-exactly-one-of-pointer-value-or-unspecified/1768.\n\nSo `pointer` seems to be on the same level as `value`, which is currently represented in `bool value_attr` in `Variable`. I believe the options are either `pointer`, or `value` or `unspecified`. So we might simply extend it to these three options.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
