But currently it will include the runtime library in each one, which will create duplicate symbols when multiple separate object files are linked. The solution is not to link the runtime library, just user code. The runtime library must then be compiled later.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/578/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
