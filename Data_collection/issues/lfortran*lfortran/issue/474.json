LFortran currently requires\n```\nlfortran -c mod.f90\nlfortran -c main.f90\nlfortran mod.o main.o\n```\nSimilarly, gfortran and other compilers will create `mod.o main.o` with the command `gfortran -c mod.f90 main.f90`. LFortran should too. Maybe this is the first thing to implement since it is a small extension of current behavior.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
