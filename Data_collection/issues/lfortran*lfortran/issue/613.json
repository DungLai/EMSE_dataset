There is the possibility to translate themes, as well as cross-linking between localized versions of the documentation:\r\n\r\n- https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/localizing-your-theme/\r\n- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-language/\r\n\r\nIt explicitly states\r\n\r\n> Translations only apply to text contained within a theme's template, such as \"next\" and \"previous\" links. The Markdown content of a page is not translated. If you wish to create multilingual documentation, you need to combine theme localization with a third-party internationalization/localization plugin.\r\n\r\nThere is a discussion from 2015 at https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/617, which resolved recently for mkdocs. The recommended way for localizing pages is to find a suitable plugin, which is quite similar to the situation we had at the Fortran-lang webpage (see https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues/197).\r\n\r\nA list of localization plugins is available at https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins#internationalization--localization, here is a selection:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/mondeja/mkdocs-mdpo-plugin (po files, early stage)\r\n- https://gitlab.com/mkdocs-i18n/mkdocs-i18n (full page replacement)\r\n- https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n (full page replacement)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf it turns out to be unfeasible to keep mkdocs and support translations (as with jekyll and i18n support for the fortran-lang.org), there seems to be a material based sphinx theme (https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/) which would be similar to the currently used theme with mkdocs. Thanks to @henilp105's great work on the [Fortran-lang webpage](https://fortran-lang.github.io/webpage/en/index.html), we already have a showcase what is possible with sphinx and MyST markdown.","closed_by":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/613/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
