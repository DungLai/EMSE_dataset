The test should test the given feature by adding a file to the `integration_tests` directory and adding it to the CMake build system there, to be executed with `gfortran` (they will typically not work with LFortran yet, but that is a separate issue).\n\nAs an example, to test the `associate` statement, a test was added here:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/blob/2a58d97dc10f16d60cdbc60ab50278c8f590763f/integration_tests/associate_01.f90\n\nand registered in CMake:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/blob/2a58d97dc10f16d60cdbc60ab50278c8f590763f/integration_tests/CMakeLists.txt#L202\n\nOther tests should be added in a similar manner. This issue should stay open until we have tests for every feature there. Adding just one test is easy to fix, so that is why it is labeled as such.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
