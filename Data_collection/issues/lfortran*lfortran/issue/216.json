The examples for the difference page can be more elaborate. It might also be a good idea to add some explanation for why ASR is different and the reasons why it is better. \n* Other useful functions and Classes like the AST and ASR visitors and builders should have explanations and usage examples in the documentation as they can be very useful and a newcomer might have difficulty going through the source code to find the use of the functions.\n* It might also be a good idea to keep a track of what Fortran features and standards are currently being supported and which once are in the working. It will give a platform to track the features better and End Users can also know which features might still be under development and they should submit issues regarding the problems they face which will be convenient for most people. \n\nIf anyone has any other suggestions or better alternatives, please discuss the regarding suggestions. \nThese suggestions might take some time to implement, but the documentation will be better.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
