By pressing the arrows you can navigate the tree and it will highlight the corresponding node and code, so you can quickly see where each node starts and ends in the code. Everything would be nice with colors and syntax highlighting, using [cpp-terminal](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal).\n\nThere can be different modes, such as:\n\n* Highlighting tokens (and some more information about the highlighted token)\n* AST\n* ASR\n* The AST/ASR can have two different forms, the s-expressions and a tree like\n\nPossible extensions in the future:\n\n* LLVM: The IR has line number information, but I don't know if it is easy to hook it up in a browser like this\n* Show compiler errors or warnings\n* Open an editor at a given line / column (Vim, VSCode, ...)\n\nRegarding the CLI, possibly it could be launched by something like:\n```\nlfortran browse a.f90\n```\nOr perhaps `lfortran open`, `lfortran show`, or something like that.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
