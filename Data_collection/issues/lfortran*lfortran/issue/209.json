An example tarball is: `lfortran-0.0+gitb9ebb38.tar.gz` (one can get the full link from https://lfortran.org/download/). This can be installed by:\n```\npip install https://lfortran.github.io/tarballs/dev/lfortran-0.0+gitb9ebb38.tar.gz\n```\nand that works, but the version looks ugly, and the tarball cannot be uploaded to the Test PyPI. A better approach is to use a version like `lfortran-0.1.14.dev3.tar.gz`, where `dev3` means 3 commits from the last `0.1.14` release. Our download page would still link the exact commit for each development release, so that one can go easily between the git commit on gitlab and a tarball.\n\nThen such development releases can be uploaded into Test PyPI, which could be useful for testing, before we tag a commit for a release.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
