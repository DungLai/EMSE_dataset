Maybe a module `lfortran_intrinsics_mod` could be defined with such intrinsics, and people could add lines such as\n\n`use lfortran_intrinsics_mod, only: dot_product`\n\nto their codes to make them compile, until they are added to LFortran proper. Some volunteers might contribute procedures if this were mentioned on Fortran Discourse.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
