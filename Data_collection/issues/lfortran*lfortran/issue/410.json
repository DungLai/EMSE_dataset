Python extension modules for example can include information like `cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu` in their name.\n\nWould it be feasible for LFortran to use a scheme like `<name>-<abi>-<arch>-<platform>.mod` to identify module files?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
