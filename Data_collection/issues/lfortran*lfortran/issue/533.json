What seems to be missing:\n\n* [ ] It compiles in quite a few functions from intrinsic modules, some of them might not work. We might want to run \"unused functions\" (and only keep `bind(c)` and dependents).\n* [ ] Get it working both ways: ASR->C, C->ASR, it currently works in prototype mode, we have to harden it and write tests\n\nOther improvements:\n\n* [ ] Split the C runtime library into LFortran frontend specific things (sin/cos, etc.) and LLVM specific, and C++ backend specific, move the latter to into `src/libasr`.\n* [ ] ASR cleanup: move `asdl_cpp.py` into `src/libasr` and reuse it\n* [ ] Add a flag to emit either C++, or C code.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
