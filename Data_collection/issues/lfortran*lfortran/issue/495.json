Please close if you think it does not belong here.\n\nMatlab recently [blogged](https://blogs.mathworks.com/pick/2021/12/29/20th-anniversary-most-active-fex-entries/?doing_wp_cron=1642610012.5719730854034423828125) about their most active File Exchanges (user-contributed codes), and one of them was [Systemic Risk](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62482-systemic-risk), a toolbox for measuring systemic financial risk from empirical data. Matlab is fairly popular in quant finance (QF), especially among traders who need something easier than C++. Financial data set are often very large, since there are tens of thousands of financial instruments traded, and since individual trade data is often studied. If LFortran can approach the convenience of Matlab or Python but retain Fortran's speed, I think there should be room for it in QF. My role could be to translate some Matlab QF functions to modern Fortran which LFortran and other compilers can use.\n\nOfshoots of APL such as J and K are used by desk quants. Maybe LFortran can be used where they are.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
