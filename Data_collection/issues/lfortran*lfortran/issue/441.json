The pure Fortran part of the runtime library should translate. The C part of the runtime library might translate with Clang, we need to investigate.\n\nWe need to add the proper option to enable Wasm into the main `lfortran` driver, and make sure everything works. Add a demo for something simple.\n\nI have asked about some of these details here: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/549#issuecomment-926915889","closed_by":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
