So compiling LAPACK and running some tests might be a good milestone. In particular I am thinking of the following steps.\n\n# Simple example\n\nCreate a relatively simple example of a main program that would depend on just a few LAPACK files. We compile it and ensure it runs correctly.\n\n# Full double precision LAPACK\n\nThen we would compile all double precision LAPACK to:\n\n* [ ] AST\n* [ ] ASR\n* [ ] LLVM\n\nand then run some tests.\n\n## Issues\n- `sbdsvdx.f` --> `semantic error: Attribute declaration not supported`","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
