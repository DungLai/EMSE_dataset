Since this is the project that depends on the multi-line prompt, I'd like to ask you for help.\n\nI'm currently working on the window class and create a PR on that over at cpp-terminal on github. I'm sure though that this will break the already problematic prompt implementation. It would be cool if you guys could assist me at merging the new window class into the prompt code base when the PR is done.\n\nAlso what about using the current repository version instead of a separate downstream in this this project? That would move the work that is made and especially the bug fixing to the upstream and everyone can benefit from that (if you haven't done that already). I know though that after the last merge of the new prompt some features broken like key combinations. We should fix that first of course, maybe also clean up the code a bit.\n\nSo yeah, what are your thoughts on that?\n\nThank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
