Updates are either scheduled or done manually via the [repository maintenance](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fortran-lang/lfortran-docs/#repository). Once merged a new PR will be opened if further translations are made. Commits will be grouped by language and author chronologically. And that's basically all to it.\r\n\r\nNB, since I usually don't do merge commits with git, I merged weblate PRs via *rebase and merge* so far to preserve the authorship.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1220013209/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"awvwgk","id":28669218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjY5MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28669218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk","html_url":"https://github.com/awvwgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1220338872","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/626#issuecomment-1220338872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/626","id":1220338872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5IvOS4","user":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-19T07:21:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T07:21:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@awvwgk awesome, thanks a lot for setting everything up and the tips.
