all features of the Julia backend have been ported. Many tests have been added. This will close #254.\r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for review. There are a few known issues, though:\r\n\r\n- Rust does not support goto.\r\n- Rust only supports `usize` indices, and the `len()` functions return `usize`, too. We may need a special pass for Rust so as to trigger casts properly.\r\n- Rust is 0-index, this plus the point above makes indexing ugly.\r\n- Should use Fortran order (column-major) for `ndarray`s\r\n- Only support up to 6-D arrays right now\r\n\r\n@certik @czgdp1807

Even a tiny change to ASR would take several hours to update all the backends, just to get the change into LFortran (or LPython). We don't have the team currently to do that.\r\n\r\nThe only way forward is to have each backend in its own repository, just like each frontend (currently LFortran, LPython) is in its own repository.\r\n\r\nWhat remains to solve is how to distribute this to make it easy to use for end users. We make it easy to build LFortran with any of the backends in separate repositories. Then when we do a release, all we need is to update the Rust backend (let's say) to work with the release and document which version to use.

Pandoc is a good example. The readers are 1500 - 2000 lines: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/ad0532244adfbd0ca9596a27506ed6161e4bc225/src/Text/Pandoc/Readers/RST.hs, the writers seem to be a lot shorter, around 800 lines: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/ad0532244adfbd0ca9596a27506ed6161e4bc225/src/Text/Pandoc/Writers/Markdown.hs.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, LPython parser is 1250 lines just the Bison grammar, 700 lines tokenizer (although with a large comment), 1000 lines converting from Bison to AST. The AST to ASR is currently about 7000 lines. I skipped some smaller utility files that I think will later be refactored into libasr. LPython is still in alpha, I expect it to at least double when it reaches production. \r\n\r\nThe LFortran's parser is at about 9000 lines (not counting any generated files), this includes both free-form (pretty much complete) and fixed-form (almost can parse SciPy). The AST to ASR is about 8000 lines currently, and when all is done, I am guessing it might double.\r\n\r\nSo overall the frontend is about 10x larger than Pandoc's frontends.\r\n\r\nRegarding backends, LFortran's AST -> SRC is 4400 lines and should be complete. The ASR->LLVM is about 8000 lines and it will probably still double. The ASR->C is currently 2000 lines, but it will probably also at least double.\r\n\r\nSo backends are also at least 10x bigger than Pandoc's backends.\r\n\r\nRegarding ASR->AST->backend, I thought about this, and initially I used to do that, but lately we just generate source code directly. For Fortran, ASR->AST would be at least 2000 lines, probably more, so ASR->AST->SRC would be over 6000 lines. A direct ASR->SRC backend might be only around 2000 or so lines, probably not more than the AST->SRC. So if we just want to generate the target language, it's better to do ASR->SRC directly, less layers to maintain, most people understand the source code, etc.  If we had to maintain AST->SRC (such as we already have it in LFortran), then it's not clear, but even then it seems it's probably easier to do ASR->SRC. However, one idea that I just got is that if we use a different language to do the ASR->AST transformation (which is just list rewriting), such as in Clojure, and somehow we generated the C++ visitor from it, it might be quite easy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the standard library, which is generally huge (especially for Python). Pandoc doesn't have it.\r\n\r\nOverall, we are dealing with at least an order of magnitude more code for everything, so I would keep things separate in separate repositories. Definitely the frontends, but I think also backends.\r\n\r\nI would say, let's start with separate Rust backend, and we can later decide if it would make sense to merge it to libasr, I think that would be relatively straightforward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1266333192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1266348303","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/816#issuecomment-1266348303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/816","id":1266348303,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5LevEP","user":{"login":"lucifer1004","id":13583761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTgzNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13583761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004","html_url":"https://github.com/lucifer1004","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucifer1004/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-04T03:29:28Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T03:29:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By mentioning `pandoc`, I did not mean that we should put all frontends and backends together.

`share/lfortran/backends/config/name` is a text file and maps the backend library filename to metadata (plugin system version, backend name, architecture, compiler used, lfortran version, function names i.e. `asr_to_rust` and `emit_rust`, etc).\r\n2. `lfortran --list-backends` scans `share/lfortran/backends/config/*` and lists all backends compatible with this lfortran version.\r\n3. `lfortran --backend rust` uses `dlopen` and `dlsym` to open the dynamic library and load `asr_to_rust()` and `emit_rust()`\r\n\r\nNote: `dlsym()` takes a symbol name and thus `asr_to_rust()` and `emit_rust()` would have to be declared as `extern \"C\"` to disable name mangling but would otherwise work the same. \r\n\r\nBuilding: One would just checkout the backend submodule with cmake and compile with `cmake --build . --target rust_target`.\r\nDistributing: Simply distribute through conda or any other package manager and install the necessary files under `share/lfortran/backends/`\r\n\r\nProblems: libasr is not a real library ATM and thus backends would include duplicated libasr code. Hopefully this won't be a problem if backends target a specific lfortran commit.\r\n\r\nCode changes: Some changes to lfortran.cpp and auxiliary functions for scanning and loading plugins. Should take less effort than writing the rust backend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1279475609/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"meow464","id":70211708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjExNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70211708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464","html_url":"https://github.com/meow464","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
