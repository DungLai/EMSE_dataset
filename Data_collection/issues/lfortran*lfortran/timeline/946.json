TODO to public a blog post\r\n\r\n* [x] add CI: https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1182\r\n* [ ] get rid of all the three \"XX\" commits in the minpack repo (by fixing it in LFortran)\r\n* [ ] get all examples working\r\n* [ ] should run at our CI correctly for a few weeks to reach \"beta\" (ideally 2 months, but we can \"overwrite\" this requirement)\r\n* [ ] write up a blog post and announce\r\n\r\n### Tracking examples\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd1\r\n- [ ] examples_lmder1\r\n   - #1150 \r\n   - #1133\r\n- [x] examples_lmdif1\r\n  - #1122\r\n- [ ] examples_primes\r\n   - #967 \r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highest Priority\r\n\r\nThe code now compiles to binary (with just minimal source modifications, see below), but doesn't produce correct answers due to:\r\n\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/971 (fixed by #972)\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/976\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps other issues that we have not identified yet.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### AST->ASR\r\n\r\nThese must be fixed, but the workaround is relatively simple by modifying Minpack sources, so are lower priority than the above.\r\n\r\nKnown TODO items for ASR (we commented out code for now):\r\n\r\n* [ ] equivalence statement\r\n* [x] statement functions (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/911)\r\n* [x] implicit external (#950)\r\n* [ ] implied do loop (#981)\r\n* [x] do loop non-constant integer increment (#909, #946, #979)\r\n* [x] argument callback (undeclared)\r\n* [x] external function declared as \"double precision f\", when it should probably be \"external f\"\r\n* [x] implicit interface failure\r\n* [ ] LFortran also prints several warnings for missing features that are ignored, so we have to fix those\r\n* [x] The -I and -J options (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/930)\r\n* [ ] `format()`: this is not strictly needed to get the correct answer and might not even be needed for SciPy, but it would be good to have it, so that things format on the screen correctly\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/certik/minpack/tree/scipy\r\n\r\n```console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/certik/minpack.git\r\ncd minpack\r\ngit checkout -t origin/scipy\r\nFC=lfortran cmake .\r\nmake\r\nctest\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll files compile to ASR as of 04d5732088ba195865ee9ccf322a4eea55070424, and when compiled sequentially, there is a failure in the LLVM backend:\r\n```console\r\n$ make\r\n[  2%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/minpack.f90.o\r\n[  4%] Building Fortran object

But only one of them will execute at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that it does not handle GoTo correctly, as now the GoToTarget (labels) get duplicated, which is incorrect --- once we add this check to verify(), it will fail verify().\r\n\r\nOne fix is to duplicate all gotos correctly. We should implement that anyway, for loop unrolling and such.\r\n\r\nBut I think we should not create two loops in the first place, we should just add the appropriate logic into one while loop. Although your approach might be faster. \r\n\r\nAnother approach is to just allow variable skips in ASR, and write an optional ASR pass to transform this into either two loops or some while logic depending on what the LLVM backend wants.\r\n\r\nCC @czgdp1807, what do you think is the best design here?\r\n\r\nTo move forward, let's implement a minimal solution that works, and once we know what the best ASR design is for this, we'll converge towards it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: in fact, it looks like we already allow variables in the \"skip\" in ASR, and we handle these in transformations later, based on the above ASR print outs. I think that is the right solution. ASR should be as abstract as possible, but still semantically equivalent to the language. I think in this case it is like that already. So it's just about fixing the ASR passes that transform the do loop into while loops that need to be rewritten. We can have one pass that does just one loop with more complicated logic, and a different pass that does two loops, but must relabel all GoTo. We can use one or the other, or the user can select which one to use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1287861424/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7646613663,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpMuHc5UlIHazwAAAAHHxhCf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7646613663","actor":{"login":"czgdp1807","id":36567889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTY3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36567889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807","html_url":"https://github.com/czgdp1807","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T17:27:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7646613667,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5UlIHazwAAAAHHxhCj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7646613667","actor":{"login":"czgdp1807","id":36567889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTY3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36567889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807","html_url":"https://github.com/czgdp1807","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-22T17:27:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1300685093","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/946#issuecomment-1300685093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/946","id":1300685093,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5NhuEl","user":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-02T15:30:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T15:30:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
