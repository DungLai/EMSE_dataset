I copy & pasted the code and on macOS I can't reproduce this, it works.\r\n\r\nI think this is because of the `\\r\\n` ending. Can you please upload the file somewhere and provide a link here? I'll try to download it and reproduce.\r\n\r\nIn addition, can you please try to create a minimal reproducible example? You do that by removing parts of this file that are not relevant to this bug, until you have the smallest file that still triggers this bug.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1214816326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1214833832","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/404#issuecomment-1214833832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/404","id":1214833832,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5IaOSo","user":{"login":"Pranavchiku","id":85227306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjI3MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85227306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku","html_url":"https://github.com/Pranavchiku","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pranavchiku/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-15T09:50:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T09:50:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Find
