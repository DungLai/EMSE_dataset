For the background: in the last couple days I got our fixed-form parser parse all of SciPy, and I noted a few things that still need fixing, such as the `elsecs` issue, you can see it in my comment here: https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/blob/41532ef8f936b9b7f86d07c3f7a402681eb67f18/src/lfortran/parser/fixedform_tokenizer.cpp#L1181, I am aware of it, but wanted to first parse SciPy, then worry about these corner cases. Due to this, LFortran currently refuses to compile `elsecs`, and it turns out this was an actual bug in SciPy.... \r\n\r\nObviously we'll \"fix\" it in LFortran, as we want to parse code according to the standard.\r\n\r\nHowever, probably adding some optional warnings for such usage might be very helpful to catch bugs. Of course, I don't know if it is worth investing more into fixed-form, as I really want to focus my efforts into free-form, where this particular issue does not happen. The only advantage would be to catch bugs in existing fixed-form code, such as the above bug.\r\n\r\nLet me know your

For the background: in the last couple days I got our fixed-form parser parse all of SciPy, and I noted a few things that still need fixing, such as the `elsecs` issue, you can see it in my comment here:\r\n> ..\r\n> Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing @certik .  Interesting situation and disappointing also since it reminds us all about the certain intransigent positions when it comes to moving forward to overcome the limitations with legacy semantics in `Fortran`.\r\n\r\nFor the immediate situation with `specfun.f` in SciPy, both you and @awvwgk have converged on the right approach.\r\n\r\nFor the longer term, I wonder whether we can review the special functions of interest to SciPy and cross-check against the current Fortran standard (it already includes support for various aspects including Bessel functions) and also the Fortran `stdlib` efforts.\r\n\r\nUltimately it will be good if the base Fortran language includes as much support as reasonable toward special functions followed by robust coverage in the Fortran `stdlib` to arrive at a point where SciPy may feel compelled to do away with the legacy FORTRAN implementation in `specfun.f` and move to modern Fortran solutions instead, notwithstanding their own backward compatibility challenges with their poorly written code in their `FORTRAN` libraries.\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you have any info on the genesis of `specfun.f`?  How did it get authored, under whose influence, and when?  It appears to have been written in not too distant past i.e., after the Fortran 90/95 standard revision and in which case it is disappointing it did not use any of the good coding practices made possible with Fortran 90/95.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1261050194/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FortranFan","id":10634847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjM0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10634847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan","html_url":"https://github.com/FortranFan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7478906398,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpMuHc5SxQwszwAAAAG9xw4e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7478906398","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-28T15:04:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7478906407,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5SxQwszwAAAAG9xw4n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7478906407","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-28T15:04:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7478906417,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpMuHc5SxQwszwAAAAG9xw4x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7478906417","actor":{"login":"FortranFan","id":10634847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjM0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10634847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan","html_url":"https://github.com/FortranFan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FortranFan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-28T15:04:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7478906425,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5SxQwszwAAAAG9xw45","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7478906425","actor":{"login":"FortranFan","id":10634847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjM0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10634847?v=4","gravat
