see. So I thought about. Seems like we can create an LLVM array of `i1` type and store the bit information as is for the Union. The size of the array will be the maximum number of bits occupied by any member of the union. Now, at the ASR level we will know the type of each member of the union and since you can access only when member at a time and in the ASR that information is easily available so just bit cast the data (the `i1` type array we created) in the union to the appropriate type. \r\n\r\nSo for ASR I will create a `Union` symbol same as `DerivedType` (names should be different because in the backend they will mean different). And in the backend I will follow the above approach (if it works, otherwise will think of something else).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1248367471/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"czgdp1807","id":36567889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTY3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36567889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807","html_url":"https://github.com/czgdp1807","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czgdp1807/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T12:21:34Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T12:21:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lcompilers/lpython/issues/1126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lcompilers/lpython","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lcompilers/lpython/issues/1126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lcompilers/lpython/issues/1126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lcompilers/lpython/issues/1126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython/pull/1126","id":1379158425,"node_id":"PR_kwDOGmWS2s4_Qw1T","number":1126,"title":"Supporting
