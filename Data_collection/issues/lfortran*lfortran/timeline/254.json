all features of the Julia backend have been ported. Many tests have been added. This will close #254.\r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for review. There are a few known issues, though:\r\n\r\n- Rust does not support goto.\r\n- Rust only supports `usize` indices, and the `len()` functions return `usize`, too. We may need a special pass for Rust so as to trigger casts properly.\r\n- Rust is 0-index, this plus the point above makes indexing ugly.\r\n- Should use Fortran order (column-major) for `ndarray`s\r\n- Only support up to 6-D arrays right now\r\n\r\n@certik @czgdp1807 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
