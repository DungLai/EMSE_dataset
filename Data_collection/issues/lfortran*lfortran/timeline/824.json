I know LFortran currently allows it, but we should give an error message. GFortran does:\r\n```console\r\n$ gfortran a.f90 \r\na.f90:6:18:\r\n\r\n    6 |       integer :: i\r\n      |                  1\r\nError: Unexpected data declaration statement at (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor other languages, like Python, the easiest is to simply not allow this, as checked by the frontend. We allow shadowing, but not using both variables in the same scope. Just one at a time.\r\n\r\nIf both variables were needed, then we would have to rename one, that should also work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1264249254/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
