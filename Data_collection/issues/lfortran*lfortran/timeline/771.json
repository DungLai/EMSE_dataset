We do not need coarrays, openmp, submodules and bunch of others to compile scipy. Eventually of course we'll add all these, but each is a project on its own.\r\n\r\nFor now I would skip all the checks and simply start compiling. Once all of Scipy works, we can see how to go forward with these checks, whether to submit a PR to meson to skip these when they are obviously not needed for scipy, or to implement enough of these features in LFortran so that LFortran passes them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1260031773/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7473417319,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5Su3s_zwAAAAG9c0xn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7473417319","actor":{"login":"zmoon","id":15079414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDc5NDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15079414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon","html_url":"https://github.com/zmoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zmoon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-28T01:23:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
