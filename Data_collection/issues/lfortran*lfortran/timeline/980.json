If lfortran doesn't support the complex-part-ref construct, then lfortran can go old school with `cmplx(real(x), -aimag(x))`.   The current implementation can raise floating exceptions that should not occur (e.g., FE_INEXACT, FE_OVERFLOW, and FE_INVALID).\r\n\r\nLong term, I would think that lfortran will in-line `conjg()` to avoid function call overhead.  Perhap, link-time optimization can mitigate the overhead.\r\n\r\nEdit: Just looked at the #727,  the one proposed code snippet has a multiplication by `-1`, i.e., `cmplx(real(x), -1*aimag(x)).
