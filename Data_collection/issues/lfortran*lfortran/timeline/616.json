In fact, the print pass is incorrect, it should not transform print *, A to the above loop, but rather to:\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. It will only work for small constant sized arrays. If an array is, `complex(8) :: A(10000)` then `print *, A(1), A(2), ...., A(10000)` isn't a good idea (too many arguments to `_lfortran_printf`). The limit to number of arguments for `printf` depends on the size of the stack. If you want to print arbitrarily large constant sized arrays then I would recommend batching the print statement as follows,\r\n\r\n```fortran\r\nprint *, A(1), A(2), ..., A(32)\r\nprint *, A(33), A(34), ...., A(64)\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nprint *, A(9953), A(9954), ..., A(9984)\r\nprint *, A(9985), A(9986), ..., A(10000)\r\n```
