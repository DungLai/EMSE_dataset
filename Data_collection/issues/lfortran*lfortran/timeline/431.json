I'm still getting these issues and wondering about the status of arrays in interactive mode. I was considering getting a future PhD student of mine involved with modern fortran (e.g. autodiffing of a modern fortran simulation code) and feel like this sort of functionality might help encourage students familiar with e.g. Python, Julia, Matlab style interactive computing.\r\n\r\nI might be able to set aside some small amounts of time to look at this over this issue the next few months or so, but I'm also very much noob when it comes to compilers/software development etc (I do naive scientific computing stuff). Are there any very basic tips for someone like me to be able to help out here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1273966447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"omaclaren","id":7819570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTk1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren","html_url":"https://github.com/omaclaren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaclaren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1273971992","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/431#issuecomment-1273971992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/431","id":1273971992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5L70UY","user":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-11T01:25:38Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T01:25:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, we will fix all these issues in interactive mode.
