see. Yes, we test those backends in integration_tests, so that they run quickly. We only add a test to run_tests.py if we specifically need to test the ASR or LLVM. Otherwise we just test that the given program in integration_tests actually compiles and runs correctly, which means that the ASR and LLVM (as well as obj and x86) must be good enough to work. Adding more tests to `tests/tests.toml` slows down the execution, and thus our development speed. We still have a small team, so being able to move quickly is important.\r\n\r\nYou might be suggesting to test every combination of ASR (let's say) and ensure the LLVM backend can generate code for that. We are in the process of writing such tests, which would greatly improve our coverage. Similarly to how you tested the parser by generating random source code from the AST. If this is what you are suggesting, then I agree we should do that. I am not working on this right now, since it is not stopping us to make good progress and I am focusing on compiling Minpack and other such codes, that's a better use of my time right now, so that we can deliver quicker.

see. The issue is that adding more tests in the tests folder makes the test runner slower. I run tests all the time when developing, so right now at this stage it is essential that they run quickly. In a way, it seems the tests folder is more suited for the frontend tests, which end with producing the correct ASR. For backend tests we currently use the integration_tests. The program1 - 4 should be added to integration_tests if they are not there. We can rethink how to test the backends, I think a good time for that would be once LFortran reaches \"beta\" status (once we can compile Minpack and couple other codes).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1306133610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
