Otherwise you have to store line, column and file (number) for each node, which I think will get quite verbose. Typically one would store a list of files first anyway, and then reference them with an index. So we might as well just use the linear index, and store filenames, line ends, etc. in the \"header\", and then we can provide simple Python functions to convert linear index into line+column+filename.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1364370519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1364428547","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1036#issuecomment-1364428547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1036","id":1364428547,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5RU4cD","user":{"login":"michaelkonecny","id":4976024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzYwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4976024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkonecny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-24T01:04:43Z","updated_at":"2022-12-24T01:04:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm...

Shouldn't it be deleted?\r\nI didn't figure out how this test was supposed to be run, perhaps someone can enlighten me (I figure it's an option I need to pass to cmake or make, but I'm not sure how to find out which one and I'm a bit lazy...).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1367592123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michaelkonecny","id":4976024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzYwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4976024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkonecny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1367874236","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1036#issuecomment-1367874236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/1036","id":1367874236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5RiBq8","user":{"login":"michaelkonecny","id":4976024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzYwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4976024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkonecny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkonecny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-30T11:40:09Z","updated_at":"2022-12-30T11:40:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On

found out today that the JSON isn't valid on Windows because the filenames contain backslashes and they don't get escaped.\r\nA quick fix would be simple - just escape the backslashes, but a better solution would probably be to use a library like [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/) to generate the JSON.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow to generate a non-indented (\"minified\") version of the JSON in order to reduce the output size.\r\nI guess this should happen when a switch like `--json-minify` is present.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say?\r\n\r\nThe library is header-only, which is nice.\r\nDoes you guys
