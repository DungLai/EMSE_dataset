TODO to public a blog post\r\n\r\n* [x] add CI: https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1182\r\n* [ ] get rid of all the three \"XX\" commits in the minpack repo (by fixing it in LFortran)\r\n* [ ] get all examples working\r\n* [ ] should run at our CI correctly for a few weeks to reach \"beta\" (ideally 2 months, but we can \"overwrite\" this requirement)\r\n* [ ] write up a blog post and announce\r\n\r\n### Tracking examples\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd1\r\n- [ ] examples_lmder1\r\n   - #1150 \r\n   - #1133\r\n- [x] examples_lmdif1\r\n  - #1122\r\n- [ ] examples_primes\r\n   - #967 \r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highest Priority\r\n\r\nThe code now compiles to binary (with just minimal source modifications, see below), but doesn't produce correct answers due to:\r\n\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/971 (fixed by #972)\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/976\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps other issues that we have not identified yet.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### AST->ASR\r\n\r\nThese must be fixed, but the workaround is relatively simple by modifying Minpack sources, so are lower priority than the above.\r\n\r\nKnown TODO items for ASR (we commented out code for now):\r\n\r\n* [ ] equivalence statement\r\n* [x] statement functions (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/911)\r\n* [x] implicit external (#950)\r\n* [ ] implied do loop (#981)\r\n* [x] do loop non-constant integer increment (#909, #946, #979)\r\n* [x] argument callback (undeclared)\r\n* [x] external function declared as \"double precision f\", when it should probably be \"external f\"\r\n* [x] implicit interface failure\r\n* [ ] LFortran also prints several warnings for missing features that are ignored, so we have to fix those\r\n* [x] The -I and -J options (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/930)\r\n* [ ] `format()`: this is not strictly needed to get the correct answer and might not even be needed for SciPy, but it would be good to have it, so that things format on the screen correctly\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/certik/minpack/tree/scipy\r\n\r\n```console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/certik/minpack.git\r\ncd minpack\r\ngit checkout -t origin/scipy\r\nFC=lfortran cmake .\r\nmake\r\nctest\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll files compile to ASR as of 04d5732088ba195865ee9ccf322a4eea55070424, and when compiled sequentially, there is a failure in the LLVM backend:\r\n```console\r\n$ make\r\n[  2%] Building Fortran object src/CMakeFiles/minpack.dir/minpack.f90.o\r\n[  4%] Building Fortran object
