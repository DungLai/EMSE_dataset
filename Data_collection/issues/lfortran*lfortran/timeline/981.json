TODO to public a blog post\r\n\r\n* [x] add CI: https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/1182\r\n* [ ] get rid of all the three \"XX\" commits in the minpack repo (by fixing it in LFortran)\r\n* [ ] get all examples working\r\n* [ ] should run at our CI correctly for a few weeks to reach \"beta\" (ideally 2 months, but we can \"overwrite\" this requirement)\r\n* [ ] write up a blog post and announce\r\n\r\n### Tracking examples\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd\r\n- [x] examples_hybrd1\r\n- [ ] examples_lmder1\r\n   - #1150 \r\n   - #1133\r\n- [x] examples_lmdif1\r\n  - #1122\r\n- [ ] examples_primes\r\n   - #967 \r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highest Priority\r\n\r\nThe code now compiles to binary (with just minimal source modifications, see below), but doesn't produce correct answers due to:\r\n\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/971 (fixed by #972)\r\n* [x] https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/976\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps other issues that we have not identified yet.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### AST->ASR\r\n\r\nThese must be fixed, but the workaround is relatively simple by modifying Minpack sources, so are lower priority than the above.\r\n\r\nKnown TODO items for ASR (we commented out code for now):\r\n\r\n* [ ] equivalence statement\r\n* [x] statement functions (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/911)\r\n* [x] implicit external (#950)\r\n* [ ] implied do loop (#981)\r\n* [x] do loop non-constant integer increment (#909, #946, #979)\r\n* [x] argument callback (undeclared)\r\n* [x] external function declared as \"double precision f\", when it should probably be \"external f\"\r\n* [x] implicit interface failure\r\n* [ ] LFortran also prints several warnings for missing features that are ignored, so we have to fix those\r\n* [x] The -I and -J options (https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/930)\r\n* [ ] `format()`: this is not strictly needed to get the correct answer and might not even be needed for SciPy, but it would be good to have it, so that things format on the screen correctly\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/certik/minpack/tree/scipy\r\n\r\n```console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/certik/minpack.git\r\ncd minpack\r\ngit

Roughly speaking, it will take a code like this:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_a\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: x(6), i\r\nx = [(i*2, i = 1, 6)]\r\nprint *, x\r\nend program\r\n```\r\nand transform it into:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_b\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: x(6)\r\nx = implied_do_loop_01()\r\nprint *, x\r\n\r\ncontains\r\n\r\n    pure function implied_do_loop_01() result(x)\r\n    integer :: x(6), i\r\n    do i = 1, 6\r\n        x(i) = i*2\r\n    end do\r\n    end function\r\n\r\nend program\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is one use case.  This will also automatically work for things like:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_a\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: i\r\nprint *, [(i*2, i = 1, 6)]\r\nend program\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other use case is this one:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_a\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: i\r\nprint *, (i*2, i = 1, 6)\r\nend program\r\n```\r\nwhich I am not sure is equivalent to the previous case (especially with regards to formatting, which we have not implemented yet). I think to be on the safe side, this case is equivalent to:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_a\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: i\r\nprint *, 1*2, 2*2, 3*2, 4*2, 5*2, 6*2\r\nend program\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the implied do loop pass, it can handle both cases. It is going over every ImpliedDoLoop, if it is wrapped in an ArrayConstant, it will the do first kind (and since we do not need this in Minpack, we can just keep the original code in there for now), and if ImpliedDoLoop is part of a Print statement, we will transform the print statement to the above last example.\r\n\r\nNote: this will not work for this case:\r\n```fortran\r\nprogram test_a\r\nimplicit none\r\ninteger :: i, n\r\nn = 10\r\nprint *, (i*2, i = 1, n)\r\nend program\r\n```\r\nSo indeed, it looks like we might need to use the first approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1309270203/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":8222938788,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCpMuHc5Vhra3zwAAAAHqIBak","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/8222938788","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cab75931b6f4d385d815c37790d8d8d69a2eae5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/certik/minpack/commits/6cab75931b6f4d385d815c37790d8d8d69a2eae5","created_at":"2023-01-13T17:20:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
