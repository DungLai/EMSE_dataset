Try to use the default clang compiler on macOS. Make sure it works with it first. \r\n\r\nOnly if that works, and you want to use Homebrew compilers, then we need to get it working. It could be that you can't mix those g++ compilers with Conda compiled LLVM which was (I think) compiled with clang. If you really want that, you might need to compile LLVM yourself with the same g++ compilers. Then things should work. You can use Spack for that. Worry about this compiler mismatch later, it gets very complicated and time consuming to debug and resolve. First try to get it working with default macOS Clang, that's what I use and it works for me, so we should be able to quickly figure out a working solution for you. Then you can experiment with another setup, and I can help you debug that too later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1256151972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1256178236","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/738#issuecomment-1256178236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/738","id":1256178236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5K38I8","user":{"login":"Nicholaswogan","id":18489667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDg5NjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18489667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan","html_url":"https://github.com/Nicholaswogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nicholaswogan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-23T12:58:33Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T12:58:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried the default clang compilers and got a similar error.
