gettext the general reference found here is quite helpful: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Preparing-Strings. The main takeway is that a program / library with translatable strings should not use any string concatenation and any reported string should be self-contained enough for translators to make sense of (which is generally a good design decision for user facing messages).\r\n\r\nFor gettext there are two modes, either using `gettext` or using `dgettext`, the former is used for standalone executables and the latter for libraries. The C version will have a global state for using `gettext` / `dgettext`, note that if this global state is not initialized querying the message catalog will *always* yield an empty string. Since the global state is handled outside of the application / library using the message catalog we don't have to worry about passing an additional object around.\r\n\r\nIn the C++ version we get a messages instance which holds all message strings, we don't really care about much other functionality for the time being available with the locale header. This message catalog needs to be available everywhere in LFortran where a string could be produced which will eventually be displayed to the user. This message catalog also must be initialized or we will have similar issues as with the C version.\r\n\r\nThe location of the MO files which are loaded is usually a path determined at configure time, note that this might interfere when the path is relative to the installation prefix and we run LFortran out of the build directory for quick testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1218227652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"awvwgk","id":28669218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjY5MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28669218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk","html_url":"https://github.com/awvwgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awvwgk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1218241496","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/608#issuecomment-1218241496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/608","id":1218241496,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5InOPY","user":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-17T16:25:33Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T16:25:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is

I see your request: say I get some Czech error messages:\r\n```console\r\n$ lfortran a.f90\r\nsemantická chyba: Proměnná 'dp' není deklarovaná\r\n  --> a.f90:19:11\r\n   |\r\n19 |     real (dp) :: x\r\n   |           ^^ 'dp' není deklarovaná\r\n```\r\nbut want to search online if somebody else hit the same error. The way to do that would be to switch to English temporarily:\r\n```console\r\n$ LANG=en lfortran a.f90\r\nsemantic error: Variable 'dp' is not declared\r\n  --> a.f90:19:11\r\n   |\r\n19 |     real (dp) :: x\r\n   |           ^^ 'dp' is undeclared\r\n```\r\nSo it seems the LANG solution would work. (We could of course add a compiler option too for selecting the language, I think that would be easy.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1221242995/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7225939313,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpMuHc5P9sEzzwAAAAGusxVx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7225939313","actor":{"login":"meow464","id":70211708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjExNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70211708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464","html_url":"https://github.com/meow464","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-20T06:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7225939315,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5P9sEzzwAAAAGusxVz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7225939315","actor":{"login":"meow464","id":70211708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjExNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70211708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464","html_url":"https://github.com/meow464","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meow464/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-20T06:26:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
