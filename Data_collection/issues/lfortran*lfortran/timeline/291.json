The merge request https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/610 shows how to do it. The only thing that does not work is function redefinition in interactive mode. But that's a relatively small feature that we can fix later. It's more important to get the rest working, so we should just take the MR 610, polish it, and merge it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1250397750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-18T22:19:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T22:19:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran/pull/12","id":1377192507,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHFd1MM4_KNzR","number":12,"title":"lfortran
