That is, the line `add_generic = x + y` will create a \"restriction\" `@plus`, hook it into ASR as usual. Then at instantiation time:\r\n```\r\ninstantiate add_t(real), only: add_real => add_generic\r\n```\r\nThe `real` type is intrinsic type, and we know how to implement the `@plus` operation on it, so it will implicitly create a function `@plus_real` that implements the `@plus` restriction on reals. And then we just call the existing ASR instantiate facility. Then we should remove the `TemplateBinOp` ASR node.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1284315935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1284317620","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/929#issuecomment-1284317620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/929","id":1284317620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpMuHc5MjSG0","user":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-19T17:03:11Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T17:03:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TODO

Problem\r\n\r\nLinked list is one of the essential data structures beside an array. It allows you to add, insert, or remove elements in constant time, without re-allocating the whole structure. \r\n\r\nFortran doesn't have a linked list. There are 3rd party libraries, but no obvious go-to solution. Fortran stdlib should have a linked list. I would use it.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n* [FLIBS](http://flibs.sourceforge.net/) by @arjenmarkus\r\n* [fortran-list](https://github.com/LadaF/fortran-list) by @LadaF\r\n* [flist](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/flist) by @jacobwilliams \r\n* [PolyCon](https://github.com/cmacmackin/PolyCon) by @cmacmackin\r\n* [Petaca](https://github.com/nncarlson/petaca) by @nncarlson\r\n* Modern Fortran Explained by MRC has an implementation in Appendix C\r\n* Many others?\r\n\r\n## What kind of data can the linked list hold?\r\n\r\nThere's various levels of capability we could pursue:\r\n\r\n1. Single type: Basically just like an array, but allows insertion in constant time;\r\n2. Elements can be of any intrinsic type in a single list;\r\n3. Can take intrinsic type **and** user-defined derived types (is this even possible in current Fortran?)\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nI don't know, something like this?\r\n\r\n```fortran\r\nuse stdlib_experimental_collections, only :: List\r\ntype(List) :: a = List()\r\n\r\ncall a % append(42)\r\ncall a % append(3.141)\r\ncall a % append('text')\r\nprint *, a % get(2) ! prints 3.141\r\ncall a % remove(3) ! a is now List([42, 3.141])\r\ncall a % insert(2, 'hello') ! a is now List([42, 'hello', 3.141])\r\n\r\na = List([1, 2, 3]) ! instantiate a list from an array","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/68/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
