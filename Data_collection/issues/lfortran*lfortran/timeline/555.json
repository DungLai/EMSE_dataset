it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1224757335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7245123788,"node_id":"CE_lADOCpMuHc5PzD4NzwAAAAGv19DM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7245123788","actor":{"login":"certik","id":20568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik","html_url":"https://github.com/certik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/certik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-23T19:55:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Shaikh-Ubaid","id":43722035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzIyMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43722035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid","html_url":"https://github.com/Shaikh-Ubaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shaikh-Ubaid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T20:55:37Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T20:55:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/540","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/540/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/540/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/540/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/540","id":1338783777,"node_id":"I_kwDOCpMuHc5PzDgh","number":540,"title":"GSoC
