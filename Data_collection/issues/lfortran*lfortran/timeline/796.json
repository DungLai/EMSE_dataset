There is `IntegerBitNot` ASR node, and the Julia backend has implemented it. Problem is that in the program above, `not(a)` is not recognized as an `IntegerBitNot` node.\r\n\r\nYes, the LFortran frontend (AST->ASR) should start using this node, instead of linking to the library function. If you can send a PR to fix this, that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"intrinsics\" flag, we are a bit inconsistent, but in general we do have this flag in ASR and you can check it in the backend and provide a specific implementation.
