issue*: https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/708\n\nIf `lfortran` is to be used as a standalone linter (which I would very much like to!), like `gfortran` and `ifort` are in our [VS Code Modern Fortran extension](https://github.com/fortran-lang/vscode-fortran-support), I believe it would need to have a flag similar to `gfortran`'s `-fsyntax-only`, where no actual compilation occurs and only the validity of the syntax is checked.\n\nI would also consider adding a convenience routine for standardising the output of the diagnostics, similar to `gfortran`'s `-fdiagnostics-plain-output`.\n(Note that `-fdiagnostics-plain-output` works on `gfortran` >= 11.0).\n\nLet me know if that sounds reasonable and doable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"gnikit","id":16143716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQzNzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16143716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit","html_url":"https://github.com/gnikit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gnikit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T13:40:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T13:40:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/647","id":1346443176,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCpMuHc49kE27","number":647,"title":"Improves
