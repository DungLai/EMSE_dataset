I see that the function jagged is called but I can't find where you defined it.\r\n\r\n@ansharlubis `jagged` is not a function, it is a variable(array of 2 elements) of type `jagged_type`.\r\n\r\n> Can you explain what the template is supposed to do in this program?\r\n\r\nSure, What I am trying to do is to see how the following code from [jagged array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20jagged,edges%20when%20visualized%20as%20output.) if used in a generic setting would look like. The said code is \r\n```fortran\r\n integer :: i\r\n type :: Jagged_type\r\n     integer, allocatable :: row(:)\r\n end type Jagged_type\r\n type(Jagged_type) :: Jagged(3)\r\n Jagged(1)%row = [1]\r\n Jagged(2)%row = [(i*2, i = 1, 9)]\r\n Jagged(3)%row = [1,2,3]\r\n print '(3i3)', Jagged(3)%row\r\nend\r\n```\r\nHere is the compiler explorer [link](https://godbolt.org/). As it works just fine there.\r\nFor the `row` it is hard coded to `integer` , so i decided to write a template of the form\r\n```fortran\r\n  requirement r(T)\r\n      type :: T; end type\r\n  end requirement\r\n\r\n  template type_t(T)\r\n     requires r(T)\r\n! jagged_type goes in here\r\n end template\r\n```\r\nThis is taken from a paper that I found in the official j3-fortran website numbered [22-182r2](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/22/22-187r2.txt), but there `type  :: T; end type` is simply referred to as `type, deferred :: T` . I initially tried the later but that didn't worked so I changed it to the former. Now we have a derived type `jagged_type` that is parameterized on type ( if I understood the template mechanism). Now I instantiated the template inside the program statement \r\n```fortran\r\ninstantiate type_t(integer) \r\n```\r\nIn principle it should create a `jagged_type` with an allocatable, integer variable `row`, right.\r\nAfter that create a new array variable named `jagged` of the type `jagged_type` \r\n```fortran\r\ntype(jagged_type) :: jagged(2)\r\n``` \r\nAnd assign value to it \r\n```fortran\r\n Jagged(1)%row = [1, 2]\r\n Jagged(2)%row = [(i*2, i = 1, 5)]\r\n```\r\nI used my own thought process through which I wrote the code to explain it and I hope it is clear enough, if not please tell me, will try my best to explain it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/comments/1343852090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DasAniruddha","id":63945875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTQ1ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63945875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha","html_url":"https://github.com/DasAniruddha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasAniruddha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7995381023,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCpMuHc5Ygiv0zwAAAAHcj9Uf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7995381023","actor":{"login":"ansharlubis","id":22386644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg2NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22386644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis","html_url":"https://github.com/ansharlubis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-09T05:03:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7995381027,"node_id":"SE_lADOCpMuHc5Ygiv0zwAAAAHcj9Uj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lfortran/lfortran/issues/events/7995381027","actor":{"login":"ansharlubis","id":22386644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg2NjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22386644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis","html_url":"https://github.com/ansharlubis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansharlubis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-09T05:03:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
