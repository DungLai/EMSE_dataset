I'm wondering how this happened, and more specifically how the scoring algorithm works (the documentation for the score function appears to say that it is a log probability, but somehow we have positive values?). Any indication as to how this one .wav file could have generated negative scores while other similar ones generated positive ones would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"813\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-11 at 12 19 38 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43184225/59289091-42a02600-8c43-11e9-9077-aef57d0387da.png\">\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
