To read more on it, you can refer to this link [log-probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability), but I can see already, how some scores are not abiding to the theory in the link.\r\n\r\nFor the scoring algorithm logic, it is based on the [Reynolds-paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.338&rep=rep1&type=pdf) but you can also refer to this shorter [reproduction/summary-paper](https://github.com/embatbr/speech-verify/blob/master/report/report.pdf).  The papers are about speaker verification/recognition but in a similar fashion, you can drop the UBM-use and consider the same logic for gender recognition. I have aslo written a small blog on this that you can find [here](https://superkogito.github.io/blog/VoiceBasedGenderRecognition.html).\r\n\r\nConcerning your recordings, they should have the same characteristics (sample rate, mono, stereo or poly, etc.) and that's why for example recordings with different microphones can be challenging in similar recognition problems. The database used in the project is normalized and all files have the same sample rate and are all mono. You can verify this using `ffmpeg -i filename.wav`. This should result in something like  `..., 16000 Hz, mono, s16, 256 kb/s`. In case, your recordings do not have similar characteristics like the ones in the [SLR45](http://www.openslr.org/45/), then use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert them and adjust them. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know how this turns out ;)
