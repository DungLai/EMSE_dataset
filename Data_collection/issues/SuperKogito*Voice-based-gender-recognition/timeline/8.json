This is actually related to the way this repository evolved with time. I have been planning to make an update to clear things up, but I kept delaying it. Hopefully by Sunday, I will update to the repository and clear things up. For now here a quick explanation of the structure: \r\n- Code repository: is the original code for voice based gender recognition using Gaussian mixture models.\r\n- hmmCode repository: is the code for voice based gender recognition using hidden Markov models.\r\n- svmCode repository: is the code for voice based gender recognition using Support vector machines.\r\n- nnCode repository: is the code for voice based gender recognition using a basic neural network.\r\n\r\nAll the codes are very similar in structure and concept except for the model and its required data formatting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/comments/632226696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SuperKogito","id":15731839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15731839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperKogito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3361507933,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMzNjE1MDc5MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/events/3361507933","actor":{"login":"SuperKogito","id":15731839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15731839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperKogito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-21T17:03:44Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/comments/632440875","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/8#issuecomment-632440875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/8","id":632440875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjQ0MDg3NQ==","user":{"login":"AnnaWang288","id":48503241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTAzMjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48503241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288","html_url":"https://github.com/AnnaWang288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnnaWang288/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-22T02:18:47Z","updated_at":"2020-05-22T02:18:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm very glad for your reply.
