Assuming you have recorded some speech in real-time and formatted it as an audio array (mono). You can compute the features characterising the audio array and later you can use the features vector in the prediction. This can be done like the following: \r\n```python3\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\r\nfrom scipy.io.wavfile import read\r\nfrom python_speech_features import mfcc\r\nfrom python_speech_features import delta\r\nfrom GenderIdentifier import GenderIdentifier\r\n\r\n\r\ndef extract_features(audio, rate):\r\n        mfcc_feature = mfcc(# The audio signal from which to compute features.\r\n                            audio,\r\n                            # The samplerate of the signal we are working with.\r\n                            rate,\r\n                            # The length of the analysis window in seconds. \r\n                            # Default is 0.025s (25 milliseconds)\r\n                            winlen       = 0.05,\r\n                            # The step between successive windows in seconds. \r\n                            # Default is 0.01s (10 milliseconds)\r\n                            winstep      = 0.01,\r\n                            # The number of cepstrum to return. \r\n                            # Default 13.\r\n                            numcep       = 13,\r\n                            # The number of filters in the filterbank.\r\n                            # Default is 26.\r\n                            nfilt        = 30,\r\n                            # The FFT size. Default is 512.\r\n                            nfft         = 1024,\r\n                            # If true, the zeroth cepstral coefficient is replaced \r\n                            # with the log of the total frame energy.\r\n                            appendEnergy = True)\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        mfcc_feature  = preprocessing.scale(mfcc_feature)\r\n        deltas        = delta(mfcc_feature, 2)\r\n        double_deltas = delta(deltas, 2)\r\n        combined      = np.hstack((mfcc_feature, deltas, double_deltas))\r\n        return combined\r\n\r\n# init gender identifier\r\ngender_identifier = GenderIdentifier(\"TestingData/females\", \r\n                                     \"TestingData/males\", \r\n                                     \"females.svm\", \"males.svm\")\r\n# get audio features vector\r\nfeatures_vector = extract_features(audio=recorded_audio_data, rate=sampling_rate)\r\n\r\n# predict/identify speaker's gender\r\npredicted_gender = gender_identifier.identify_gender(features_vector)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for how to get the recorded audio, I suggest following something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35344649/reading-input-sound-signal-using-python). A few things to mind here are: \r\n - The sampling_rate, it has to be similar to the one of the audio files, that the gender models are based on.\r\n - Your audio data should have the right formatting and data type (similar to the one returned by `scipy.io.wave.read(), which is what I used to pre-process my audio files).\r\n\r\nHope this helps :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/comments/570726166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SuperKogito","id":15731839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15731839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperKogito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperKogito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/comments/570735863","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/4#issuecomment-570735863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues/4","id":570735863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDczNTg2Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T00:10:31Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T00:10:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is hugely helpful.
