No, this is not a GMM-UBM system, I am only using GMMs because I only have two models to compare, so it should be enough. A GMM-UBM could be more accurate but I cannot compute UBMs using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) as this would result in a [memory problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51935550/how-to-solve-memoryerror-in-sklearn-when-fitting-huge-data-to-a-gmm), so if you want to do that I suggest using [bob](https://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/).\r\n2. It depends which code you are using, the code includes two different codes one for Gaussian mixture models (.gmm) and Hidden Markov models (.hmm).
