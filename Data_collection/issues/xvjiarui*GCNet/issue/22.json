Similarly, Kinetics used pretrained ResNet on ImageNet to inflate the Slow-Only model.\r\n\r\nSection 4.1 from SGENet paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09646.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09646.pdf)) also notes that it was difficult to train GCNet from beginning. Have you experimented GCNet by training from scratch?  Is there a reason why you chose not to train from scratch with GC module attached?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tea1528","id":22886085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg2MDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22886085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528","html_url":"https://github.com/tea1528","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tea1528/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
