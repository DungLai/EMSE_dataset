Therefore the final result is much lower than original ResNet50. Note that one difference from the original paper is that the GC modules are embedded in each bottleneck exactly as SE does, for a fair comparison. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have the same problem?\r\n\r\nThis may be the case since the authors report the ImageNet results via a finetuning setting, which is not very common when validating models on ImageNet Benchmarks. At least all other modules (SE, SK, BAM, CBAM, AA) are following a training-from-scratch setting.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/10/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
