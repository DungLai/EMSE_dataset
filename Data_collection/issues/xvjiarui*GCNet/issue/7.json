Since in segmentation task, both OCNet and DANet have shown that spatial attention module (same as non-local block) can learn attention maps that concentrated on pixels with the same category as the query one, rather than query-independent.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/7/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
