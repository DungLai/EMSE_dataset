Using the best setting of GC-ResNet50 and train it from scratch on ImageNet, I found it will be stuck in a high loss in the early epochs before the training loss begins to decline normally.

However, I tried to train the network on ImageNet and GC achieves a worse performance than original ResNet. Then I follow the paper that fine-tune the ResNet50 for other 40 epochs using cosine schedule， and the performance is still bad. Could you please share you fine-tuning code, and I can cite your work in my research. Thanks a lot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/comments/592276968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ma-xu","id":6723062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjMwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6723062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu","html_url":"https://github.com/ma-xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ma-xu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3080197021,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA4MDE5NzAyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/events/3080197021","actor":{"login":"xvjiarui","id":18479688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18479688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui","html_url":"https://github.com/xvjiarui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-28T02:16:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3080197022,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwODAxOTcwMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/events/3080197022","actor":{"login":"xvjiarui","id":18479688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18479688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui","html_url":"https://github.com/xvjiarui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvjiarui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-28T02:16:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/comments/594984166","html_url":"https://github.com/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/10#issuecomment-594984166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xvjiarui/GCNet/issues/10","id":594984166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDk4NDE2Ng==","user":{"login":"Shiro-LK","id":26505641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTA1NjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26505641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK","html_url":"https://github.com/Shiro-LK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shiro-LK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-05T01:46:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T01:46:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@xvjiarui
