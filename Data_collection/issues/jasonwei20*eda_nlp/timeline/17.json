That's probably better, yeah.\r\n1.1 You're right.\r\n2. Yeah I guess that's right, although I don't know if it will actually make a difference in performance.\r\n3. Yep.\r\n4. It looks like `random.sample` works without replacement, so you're right I think. Maybe there was an edge case when I first wrote it, but I don't remember.\r\n5. Sometimes WordNet replaces a single word with a two-word synonym, in which case you need to separate the two words.\r\n6. Yeah so for this one, I did some experiments where I wanted to generate say 1 augmented sentence per 4 real sentences (i.e., `num_aug=4`). Note that the output always includes the original sentence, so in this case, there will be on average 1.25 sentences (original + augmented) back.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to submit a PR with any edits, I would be more than happy to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwei20/eda_nlp/issues/comments/551068420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonwei20","id":26695953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26695953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonwei20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2779235612,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc3OTIzNTYxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwei20/eda_nlp/issues/events/2779235612","actor":{"login":"jasonwei20","id":26695953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26695953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonwei20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-07T12:58:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
