Example - Sometimes, you might just want to apply Synonym Replacement (SR) and Random Deletion (RD), while ignoring the other two techniques (Random Insertion & Random Swap) as it may completely change the label. One dataset I could think of is [Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability(CoLA)](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/), where RI & RS I believe will change the target label.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation the passed argument `alpha` is applied equally for each of the augmentation. Passing `alpha` for each of the technique as command line argument individually would allow fine grained control & will help achieve the desired task.","closed_by":{"login":"jasonwei20","id":26695953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26695953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonwei20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonwei20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwei20/eda_nlp/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasonwei20/eda_nlp/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
