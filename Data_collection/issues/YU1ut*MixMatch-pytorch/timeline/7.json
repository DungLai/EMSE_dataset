For cifar10, the best acc is 0.8982 with 250 labels, 0.9438 with 4000labels. However, these results are based on the model of wideresnet, which is utilized in paper. The accuracy woud be much worse when I alternate it with resnet50. The best acc is 0.7384 with 250 labels, 0.8219 with 4000labels.

\r\n\r\n> Firstly, thanks for you great work.\r\n> I have done several experiments using your codes, and most experimental results are satisfied. For cifar10, the best acc is 0.8982 with 250 labels, 0.9438 with 4000labels. However, these results are based on the model of wideresnet, which is utilized in paper. The accuracy woud be much worse when I alternate it with resnet50. The best acc is 0.7384 with 250 labels, 0.8219 with 4000labels. I wonder why different models produce such different results ？\r\n\r\nCould you share us with the hyper-parameters?

hyper-parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/comments/565306338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dddzg","id":15963514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTYzNTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15963514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg","html_url":"https://github.com/dddzg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dddzg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2880233279,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg4MDIzMzI3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/events/2880233279","actor":{"login":"shuxjweb","id":25083505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDgzNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25083505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb","html_url":"https://github.com/shuxjweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:30:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2880233280,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4ODAyMzMyODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/events/2880233280","actor":{"login":"shuxjweb","id":25083505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDgzNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25083505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb","html_url":"https://github.com/shuxjweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuxjweb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:30:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/comments/580036738","html_url":"https://github.com/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/7#issuecomment-580036738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/7","id":580036738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDAzNjczOA==","user":{"login":"berzentine","id":8656336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTYzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8656336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine","html_url":"https://github.com/berzentine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/berzentine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T01:04:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T01:04:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Has
