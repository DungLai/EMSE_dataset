Now, if, one keeps forwarding the small labelled dataset through NN, again and again, these BN parameters get biased. Interleave method avoids that. \r\n\r\nOne can definitely avoid this by passing both labelled and unlabeled data together (after concatenating) in a single forward pass, but then due to larger batch size learning rate needs to be adjusted. \r\n\r\nI am closing this issue.
