When I run the code you give, it just uses 1325MiB GPU. I want to accelerate the speed,  so I change the hyper-parameters of batch_size=256or512(default 64) and val_iteration=256or128(default 1024), but I didn't get the ideal result.  What should I do? Must val_iteration be 1024?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/11/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
