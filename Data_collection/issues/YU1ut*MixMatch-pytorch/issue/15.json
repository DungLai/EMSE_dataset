For verify the accuracy of your work, I repeat these configurations and get satisfying results.\r\nHowever, I find an amazing result, that is the accuracy under  T = 1 ( Mixmatch without temperature sharpening) is larger than T = 0.5. ## I only change parameter T, and other parameters are the same as yours.\r\n\r\nSo, can I get an inference that temperature sharpening operate does not work?
