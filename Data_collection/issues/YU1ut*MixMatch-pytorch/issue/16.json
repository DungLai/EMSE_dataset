Additionally, If I don't use mix-up trick in your code framework(I think it should equals to Mean-Teacher), But I can't get ideal result as Mean-Teacher(1000 labels 77%(mine) < 79%(mean-teacher)， 4000 labels 87% < 88%(mean-teacher ).\r\n@YU1ut ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
