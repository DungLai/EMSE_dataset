It doesn't convert speech to text.\r\n\r\nWhen the `\"please talk\"` is printed on your console, then you should start expressing an emotion using the microphone, it'll automatically stop recording when you stop speaking.\r\n\r\nHope this removes the ambiguity,\r\nThanks,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/753222451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4160452994,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE2MDQ1Mjk5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4160452994","actor":{"login":"OkicB","id":55504119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTA0MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55504119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB","html_url":"https://github.com/OkicB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-31T23:06:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4160452995,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNjA0NTI5OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4160452995","actor":{"login":"OkicB","id":55504119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTA0MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55504119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB","html_url":"https://github.com/OkicB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OkicB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-31T23:06:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
