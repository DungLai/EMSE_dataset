Note that you'll need to have [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed in your machine in order to properly convert the audio files.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Let me know when this solves your issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/800162152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4463826262,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ2MzgyNjI2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4463826262","actor":{"login":"maximtolea","id":44133771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTMzNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44133771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea","html_url":"https://github.com/maximtolea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-16T11:01:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4463826270,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NjM4MjYyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4463826270","actor":{"login":"maximtolea","id":44133771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTMzNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44133771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea","html_url":"https://github.com/maximtolea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximtolea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-16T11:01:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/913168624","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/20#issuecomment-913168624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/20","id":913168624,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCvQ9A842bdjw","user":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-05T14:50:46Z","updated_at":"202
