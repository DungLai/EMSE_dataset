Here is the first example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom emotion_recognition import EmotionRecognizer\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\n# init a model, let's use SVC\r\nmy_model = SVC()\r\n# pass my model to EmotionRecognizer instance\r\n# and balance the dataset\r\nrec = EmotionRecognizer(model=my_model, emotions=['sad', 'neutral', 'happy'], balance=True, verbose=0)\r\n# train the model\r\nrec.train()\r\n# check the test accuracy for that model\r\nprint(\"Test score:\", rec.test_score())\r\n# check the train accuracy for that model\r\nprint(\"Train score:\", rec.train_score())\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nThanks,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/806837137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4508127694,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDUwODEyNzY5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4508127694","actor":{"login":"jwcen","id":45908358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTA4MzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45908358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen","html_url":"https://github.com/jwcen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T14:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4508127700,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1MDgxMjc3MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4508127700","actor":{"login":"jwcen","id":45908358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTA4MzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45908358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen","html_url":"https://github.com/jwcen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwcen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T14:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4508134253,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUwODEzNDI1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4508134253","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-25T14:20:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
