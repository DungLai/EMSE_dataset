@eduardblumental ,\r\n\r\nSorry for not getting to you back sooner,\r\n\r\nI've added/deleted some samples from `data` folder and didn't update the README results, I'm also getting 69% accuracy on test set with regular `SVC()` model.\r\n\r\nAfter I ran `rec.determine_best_model()`, the resulting model is a tweaked `SVC()` with `C=10` and `gamma=0.001`, and got 88.4% accuracy with it!\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\nThanks,\r\nRockikz","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/752147863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4155132813,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE1NTEzMjgxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4155132813","actor":{"login":"eduardblumental","id":57115587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTE1NTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57115587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental","html_url":"https://github.com/eduardblumental","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-29T16:31:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4155132815,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNTUxMzI4MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/4155132815","actor":{"login":"eduardblumental","id":57115587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTE1NTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57115587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental","html_url":"https://github.com/eduardblumental","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eduardblumental/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-29T16:31:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
