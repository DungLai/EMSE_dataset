can use custom data only as mentioned in `README.md`, after deleting my own custom data in `data/train-custom` and `data/test-custom` folders, you can add your own there.\r\nAfter that, you need to disable default datasets, here is the code for that:\r\n```\r\nfrom emotion_recognition import EmotionRecognizer\r\nrec = EmotionRecognizer(None, emotions=[\"sad\", \"neutral\", \"happy\"], tess_ravdess=False, emodb=False, custom_db=True)\r\nrec.get_samples_by_class()\r\n```\r\n**Outputs: (in my case)**\r\n```\r\n         train  test  total\r\nsad         21    16     37\r\nneutral     21    16     37\r\nhappy       21    16     37\r\ntotal       63    48    111\r\n```\r\nYou can find the best model suited automatically:\r\n```\r\nrec.determine_best_model()\r\n```\r\n**Outputs:**\r\n```\r\n[+] Best model determined: MLPClassifier with 77.083% test accuracy\r\n```\r\nTo add your custom data, all you need to do is converting your audio samples to 16000 sample rate as mentioned in `README.md` (please read it) and then labeling each sample by its emotion at the end of its name, here is an example: `20190615_014359_sad.wav` will automatically classified as sad sample.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/541198488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/617765335","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/4#issuecomment-617765335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/4","id":617765335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzc2NTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"Tanish18","id":41122262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTIyMjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41122262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18","html_url":"https://github.com/Tanish18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-22T13:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T13:02:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,

Now I fixed it and it set it to `False` when there are no samples on some emotion classes.\r\n\r\nSo please pull the latest updates.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/comments/685697577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3719503006,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzcxOTUwMzAwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/3719503006","actor":{"login":"x4nth055","id":37851086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37851086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055","html_url":"https://github.com/x4nth055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x4nth055/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-02T12:23:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3719503022,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcxOTUwMzAyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/3719503022","actor":{"login":"Tanish18","id":41122262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTIyMjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41122262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18","html_url":"https://github.com/Tanish18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-02T12:23:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3719503026,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MTk1MDMwMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech/issues/events/3719503026","actor":{"login":"Tanish18","id":41122262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTIyMjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41122262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18","html_url":"https://github.com/Tanish18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tanish18/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-02T12:23:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
