buddy, I think this is not the place to discuss this, please consider emailing me... xD\r\n`test.py` script was designed just to test the project and the models, the model used in `test.py` isn't even optimal, try testing Example 1 that is mentioned in `README.md`.\r\n- Note that this project is recognizing emotions using the speech tone ( not from speech to text and then analyzing the text ), so try being sad or happy ( or even change the set of emotions ) in your tone. please check the data used and you'll understand ( in `data` folder ).\r\n- Also note that if `test.py` is bothering you,

again !!\r\nIs there a way to integrate text analysis as well ? or do you think that is not a good idea?\r\nAs per your knowledge, can we add GUI around this ? which can show what person is speaking
