I've been using converted youtube audio clips (in the final form of .wav). For some reason, basic predictions aren't being done on these files. I wanted to know if you could explain how one should properly test these new WAV files. For the time being, I've just been following example 2 in the README, downloading the files, and putting them in their own folder within the emotion-recognition-using-speech one. Is there anything in the code I should modify to be able to use this program on wav files converted from Youtube?
