@goerch - thanks for raising this issue. \r\n\r\nIt is hard for me to debug this without a minimal reproducible example (as I don't have access to your data).\r\n\r\nLooking at your code, I wonder if the `VarianceThreshold` step is the cause for the different shapes in the output of _fit_bootstrap_sample. Depending on the bootstrap sample, this transformer may drop different variables which will result in a different data matrix that is passed to `SelectFromModel`. Perhaps you can log the shapes of the input and output data to `VarianceThreshold` and compare that to the shape of `selected_variables`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/comments/550400398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thuijskens","id":10687691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjg3Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10687691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens","html_url":"https://github.com/thuijskens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thuijskens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2776093593,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc3NjA5MzU5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/events/2776093593","actor":{"login":"goerch","id":3709434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch","html_url":"https://github.com/goerch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-06T16:53:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2776093594,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NzYwOTM1OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/events/2776093594","actor":{"login":"goerch","id":3709434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch","html_url":"https://github.com/goerch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-06T16:53:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/comments/550420445","html_url":"https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/29#issuecomment-550420445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn-contrib/stability-selection/issues/29","id":550420445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDQyMDQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"goerch","id":3709434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch","html_url":"https://github.com/goerch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goerch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T17:40:01Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T17:40:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
