@sshkhr and @cpsxhao, thank you for your question and explanation related to the \"real early exit\" issue. I am also very curious about this, and I am wondering if I can implement the \"real early exit\" for a dynamic neural network using current DL frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow? It would be great if you can give me some clues or show me some example codes for that. Thank you very much!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/comments/830811195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"binqi-sun","id":80131832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTMxODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80131832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun","html_url":"https://github.com/binqi-sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binqi-sun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4674803127,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY3NDgwMzEyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/events/4674803127","actor":{"login":"sshkhr","id":10473376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDczMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10473376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr","html_url":"https://github.com/sshkhr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-02T13:38:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4674803131,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NzQ4MDMxMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/events/4674803131","actor":{"login":"sshkhr","id":10473376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDczMzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10473376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr","html_url":"https://github.com/sshkhr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshkhr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-02T13:38:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4674803133,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY3NDgwMzEzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/events/4674803133","actor":{"login":"cpsxhao","id":17894850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17894850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cpsxhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-02T13:38:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4674803135,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NzQ4MDMxMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/events/4674803135","actor":{"login":"cpsxhao","id":17894850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u
