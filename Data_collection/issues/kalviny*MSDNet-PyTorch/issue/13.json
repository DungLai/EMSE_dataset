It has been extremely helpful for my work.\r\n\r\nReading through validate() in main.py and dynamic_evaluate() in adaptive_inference.py it seems to me that the model processes the entire input in both anytime prediction and budgeted batch classification setting: \r\n\r\nIn main.py in validate() function in Line 227\r\n`output = model(input_var)`\r\n\r\nIn adaptive_inference.py in calc_logit() function in Line 53:\r\n`output = self.model(input_var)`\r\n\r\nwhich returns an array for results from each block. And then the accuracy calculations for early exit are done in hindsight considering whether the model would have been right or wrong if we consider the output from the intermediate classifiers. Could you please confirm that my interpretation is correct?","closed_by":{"login":"cpsxhao","id":17894850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk0ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17894850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cpsxhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpsxhao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/13/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kalviny/MSDNet-PyTorch/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
