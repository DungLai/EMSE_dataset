(Guess audio wav file is input and ply mesh data of each subject is output?)\r\n\r\nAm I just put these data only and run 'run_training.py' script? Additionally if i want to train my own datasets, it's same as vocaset? (of course I will change 'config_parser.py' script for new dataset) \r\n\r\nSorry for poor English and thank you for your answer.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/80/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
