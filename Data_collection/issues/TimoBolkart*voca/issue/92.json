I am manipulating the output mesh into flame params to know better how the flame model works by using compute_flame_param.py.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am confused about the pose component of the flame model. I found the original pose to be shape size 12 ([link here](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME/blob/5c6b7fa9e21405058007289275efc10668da57dc/sample_FLAME.py), and explanation as 「- articulation of neck (paramters: pose[0:3]), jaw (paramters: pose[3:6]), and eyeballs (paramters: pose[6:12])」) while the pose component from the flame model used in voca demo is 15 (where jaw movement is controled by [6:9]). \r\n\r\nCould you please give a detailed explanation on each of pose params? Thanks !!
