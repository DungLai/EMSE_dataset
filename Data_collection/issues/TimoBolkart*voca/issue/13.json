I found that the result of the model contain the static face information in the training data(I downloaded on the  MPI-IS/VOCASET) when i try to trained the model according to your paper:\r\nsuch as the out put of '.obj' in the 'animation_output' folder will contain the face static features which  in the training data,the face static feature is change and is not the same as 'template/FLAME_sample.ply' when i set  '--condition_idx 3', \r\nCould you please tell me the reason of the question?\r\nAnd I found the template as input such as \"input_template: np.repeat(template.v[np.newaxis, :, :, np.newaxis], num_frames, axis=0)\" when i  run run_voca.pyï¼Œis it use to initialized the weights or it has another purpose?Could you please tell me the use of the template in training?","closed_by":{"login":"zxc210","id":20534540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTM0NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20534540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210","html_url":"https://github.com/zxc210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxc210/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
