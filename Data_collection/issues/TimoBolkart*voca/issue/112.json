So, these vertex displacements are computed due to expression changes in the training meshes or they are generic and capture the overall vertex displacements of the meshes? \r\n\r\nThe name of the file **init_expression_basis.npy**, so why it is named as expression basis, and also if I explore the shape of the tensor it is (5023*3,100). Can you please provide more idea on this initialization technique?
