Therefore,  each window includes window_size/2 frame before the current frame and window_size/2 frame after the current frame. \r\n\r\n```\r\nzero_pad = np.zeros((int(self.audio_window_size / 2), network_output.shape[1]))\r\nnetwork_output = np.concatenate((zero_pad, network_output, zero_pad), axis=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm trying to re-train the model without gathering the future data with the intended application in real-time animation. Therefore, I modified the padding zero section as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nzero_pad = np.zeros((int(self.audio_window_size), network_output.shape[1]))\r\n network_output = np.concatenate((zero_pad, network_output), axis=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the result became much worse.\r\n\r\nMay I know if there is any reason the audio window has to be padded as that? \r\nIs there any specific pre-processing for the target vertex that has relationship with the window?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":{"login":"wuxx1624","id":23463792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDYzNzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23463792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxx1624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxx1624/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
