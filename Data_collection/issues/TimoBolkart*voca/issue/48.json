When I tried the Ringnet repository many of the meshes looked similar with another. Hence as you know, the texture is really important for identifying a person. How can I add texture to the meshes for using them in VOCA. I have tried with TF_FLAME for creating texture for the mesh using the image file but it was not usable in VOCA. Can you suggest how I can do this?\r\nIt will be really grateful if you can help me with this.
