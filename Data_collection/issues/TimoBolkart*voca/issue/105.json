Similarly, using TF_FLAME's 'generate VOCA template' also produces random face shape meshes that work perfectly.\r\n\r\nHowever, a mesh generated (in FLAME topology) using TF_FLAME's 'fit registered 3D meshes' produces an output animation that has the rendered model mesh displayed, but only distortions to the mouth and various face regions (but no comprehensible lip sync motions). \r\n\r\nI initially thought this was due to the mesh not being in 'zero pose', however a zero pose FLAME topology mesh I have generated using FLAME's Blender add-on also has the same distortions when used as the template mesh in `demo.py`. Similarly, meshes aligned using ICP (Iterative Closest Point) to be in zero pose have the same distortions.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to convert an arbitrary model in FLAME topology to a VOCA-compatible template mesh?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot and great work :)\r\n\r\n[Edit] I've just tried importing and exporting the default VOCA-compatible template model from Blender to use as the template mesh in `demo.py` as a sanity check, however this creates the same artefacts, so perhaps exporting from Blender is what is causing the problem.
