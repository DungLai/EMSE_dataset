For indices outside of the range it provides a zero vector. The model is not trained with conditions outside of the range and hence I would not recommend usage of out-of-range indices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/544592386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2730337082,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjczMDMzNzA4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/events/2730337082","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-21T16:20:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/544782887","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/19#issuecomment-544782887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/19","id":544782887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDc4Mjg4Nw==","user":{"login":"chaiyujin","id":10378898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc4ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10378898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin","html_url":"https://github.com/chaiyujin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaiyujin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T02:31:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T02:31:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have to apologize for this question, because I'm not familiar with tf.one_hot.
