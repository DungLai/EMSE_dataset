But we cannot include the eyeblink information to this texture data.\r\nwe use the command: _python edit_sequences.py --source_path './animation_output_textured/meshes' --out_path './FLAME_eye_blink' --flame_model_path  './flame/generic_model.pkl' --mode blink --num_blinks 2 --blink_duration 15_\r\nthen we use the command:\r\n_python visualize_sequence.py --sequence_path './FLAME_eye_blink/meshes' --audio_fname './audio/test_sentence.wav' --out_path './FLAME_eye_blink'_\r\n when  we try to do the eyeblink operation it shows the animation result without the texture data. \r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/701159589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkolaf","id":39689495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg5NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39689495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf","html_url":"https://github.com/rkolaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkolaf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/701258772","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/51#issuecomment-701258772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/51","id":701258772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTI1ODc3Mg==","user":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T08:56:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T08:56:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hi, that sounds reasonable.

for the late reply, you are right, edit_sequences.py and visualize_sequence.py unfortunately ignore the texture of the meshes. An easy workaround is to run the visualize_sequence.py with the  flags `--uv_template_fname` and `--texture_img_fname` as you also do for the run_voca.py demo. This adds the fixed texture then to the meshes before rendering.
