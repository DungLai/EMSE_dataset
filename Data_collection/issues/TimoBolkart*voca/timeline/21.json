Timo,\r\n\r\nFirst thanks for sharing the code for VOCA, very impressive work.  I am wondering why  VOCA does not output FLAME parameters (at least expression parameters).  Can the current VOCA network be modified such that the model will output expression parameters?\r\n \r\n\"VOCA outputs meshes in FLAME mesh topology. However, it does not directly output FLAME parameters but you can easily compute this using this code [TF_FLAME](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/TF_FLAME). The demo to fit the 3D model to registered 3D meshes should do the job\"\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @TimoBolkart in https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/21#issuecomment-554553279_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
