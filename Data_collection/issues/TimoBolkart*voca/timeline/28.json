The resulting data are denoted as **Registered Data**. \r\nWe then unpose all registered meshes. This is done by fitting FLAME to each mesh, followed by removing effects of global rotation, translation, and head rotation around the neck. These data are denoted as **Unposed Data**. \r\nFinally, to get the **Unposed Cleaned Data**, we fix for each sequence (within the Unposed Data) the neck boundary vertices and the ear vertices to a fixed locatio, and apply to the region around the eyes a Gaussian filtering (across the sequence) to mitigate capture noise. \r\nDoes this answer your question?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/573715661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/573956660","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/28#issuecomment-573956660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/28","id":573956660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Mzk1NjY2MA==","user":{"login":"fastcode3d","id":42864265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODY0MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42864265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d","html_url":"https://github.com/fastcode3d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastcode3d/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T01:34:49Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T01:34:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes,
