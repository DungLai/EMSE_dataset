Therefore, the output vertex offset (i.e. the animation offset for the particular window) is reconstructed from some speech information before and after the actual frame. As a consequence we need to pad the sequence in the beginning and end by half a window size such that reconstruction get a complete feature window as input. Some temporal context is actually important to get a smooth animation while the model effectively predicts results only in a frame-by-frame manner.
