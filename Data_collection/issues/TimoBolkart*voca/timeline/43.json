scan with the FLAME model`\r\nMy question relates to using a mesh which is **not a scan** but a **3D mesh modeled by a 3d artist**.\r\nIn the paper, I can read: `the authors provided us with a static mesh, to which we aligned the FLAME topology`.\r\nBut how can you align the FLAME topology over a 3D model?\r\n\r\nYou also mention: `Then you need to undo the effects of pose`\r\nA handmade 3D model should already by in a neutral pose, from my understanding it just need to have it's transform reset so that the mesh position overlays one of the FLAME ply meshes.\r\nI think I can do it using

The basic idea is to replace the vertex to vertex distance from the fit_3D_mesh demo with a general point to surface distance and minimize this instead. This is often referred to non-rigid ICP. \r\n\r\nAnother option could be using the provided [FLAME Blender plugin](https://github.com/TimoBolkart/FLAME-Blender-Add-on) to output a mesh in FLAME topology that then can be animated by VOCA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/693590805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/comments/744066560","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/43#issuecomment-744066560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TimoBolkart/voca/issues/43","id":744066560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDA2NjU2MA==","user":{"login":"TimoBolkart","id":26549953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ5OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26549953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart","html_url":"https://github.com/TimoBolkart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimoBolkart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-13T20:50:51Z","updated_at":"2020-12-13T20:53:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We also just added some demo code to fit FLAME to a scan of arbitrary topology in the [flame-fitting repo](https://github.com/Rubikplayer/flame-fitting).
