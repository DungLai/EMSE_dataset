seems there is some confusion about the mesh input to VOCA. As described in the readme, VOCA animates static templates in FLAME topology. Such templates can be obtained by fitting FLAME to scans, images, or by sampling the FLAME shape space. This means the input mesh must be in semantic correspondence to the FLAME template. Sampling the FLAME shape space for instance can give you an almost infinite amount of templates that can be animated by VOCA.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get a particular scan into FLAME topology (as we did for the scan on Winston Churchill), you can for instance read [Section 4.2 of the FLAME paper](https://www.is.mpg.de/uploads_file/attachment/attachment/400/paper.pdf) how this is done.  Long story short, this is an optimization problem where one minimizes the difference between the mesh surface of the FLAME surface and the scan. \r\n\r\nWe could potentially release VOCA compatible meshes for 1200 subjects obtained by scanning them.

I checked that the output of the voca model is an obj file containing only the values ​​of v and f. If I have an obj file (containing only the values ​​of v and f) and then convert it into a ply file, can I do anything about it  You can rewrite the obj file containing vf, vn, etc. into the obj file output by the model.  At this time, I also have the corresponding mtl file and texture png.  Is there any method for reference?
