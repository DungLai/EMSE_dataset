(Guess audio wav file is input and ply mesh data of each subject is output?)\r\n> \r\n> Am I just put these data only and run 'run_training.py' script? Additionally if i want to train my own datasets, it's same as vocaset? (of course I will change 'config_parser.py' script for new dataset)\r\n> \r\n> Sorry for poor English and thank you for your answer.\r\n\r\nI have the same question, it seems nobody response in this repo.
