I'm not 100% sure, but there are a few things you can try.\r\n\r\n1. The device should appear as `/dev/hidraw#` where # is a number that you'll need to figure out.  You should be able to `sudo cat /dev/hidraw#` and have nonsense data printed to the screen.\r\n2. Depending on the ubuntu version, you may require udev rules.  Try adding `SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ACTION==\"add\", MODE=\"0664\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"` to a file `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbdevice.rules`\r\n3.
