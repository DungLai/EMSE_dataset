Normally it requires a dedicated 1Gbps network connection.  Are you sharing network bandwidth with ROS (and especially streaming camera images)? Depending on your networking equipment, it can saturate and fail. \r\nI would recommend having one network connection for ROS/internet etc, and a separate, dedicated network link to the panda. I believe this is also what is recommended by Franka.  This is the setup that we use and it works reliably. \r\n\r\nRelevant Franka FAQ is here which has a lot of other troubleshooting tips for this error:\r\nhttps://frankaemika.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#motion-stopped-due-to-discontinuities-or-communication-constraints-violation","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dougsm/mvp_grasp/issues/comments/579471067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dougsm","id":26375098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Mzc1MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26375098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm","html_url":"https://github.com/dougsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougsm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dougsm/mvp_grasp/issues/comments/579726856","html_url":"https://github.com/dougsm/mvp_grasp/issues/9#issuecomment-579726856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dougsm/mvp_grasp/issues/9","id":579726856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTcyNjg1Ng==","user":{"login":"seivazi","id":4396080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTYwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4396080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi","html_url":"https://github.com/seivazi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seivazi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T12:07:41Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T12:07:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You are right!
