I was able to track this down this morning. It appears that sports-reference.com changed the name of the table I was pulling the player's rushing and receiving information from `rushing_and_receiving` to `receiving_and_rushing`. Since I was looking for the wrong table name, it made it appear it didn't exist, causing those statistics to be empty as you saw. Luckily, it's an easy fix where I now search for both of the table names I listed above. I will create a PR shortly and get this merged in master.\r\n\r\nBTW, this is what I'm seeing now:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nfl.roster import Player\r\n\r\njones = Player('JoneJu02')\r\nstats = jones.dataframe[[\"games\", \"receptions\"]]\r\nprint(stats)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n        games  receptions\r\n2011       13          54\r\n2012       16          79\r\n2013        5          41\r\n2014       15         104\r\n2015       16         136\r\n2016       14          83\r\n2017       16          88\r\n2018       16         113\r\nCareer    111         698\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething's obviously wrong if it's saying both Julio Jones and Wes Welker had zero receptions. :smiley:\r\n\r\nI will get this resolved shortly!
