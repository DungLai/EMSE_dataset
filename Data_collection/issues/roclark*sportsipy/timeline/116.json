@alokpattani, I think we can both agree that my response here is _way_ overdue. My apologies! I greatly appreciate you opening this issue as well as your other (which I will comment on shortly). This is very well written and provides everything I need to get this taken care of!\r\n\r\nSpeaking specifically about this issue, it appears that the games you listed (and there are probably others buried on the site) don't have a time associated with them as you mention, which forces Python to throw an error while attempting to create a `datetime` object for the game. I think the safest thing to do is to create a handler for this scenario so that the code can continue safely. My planned fix is to create a default game time of 7:00PM for games that don't have a time listed as this appears to be the most common start-time for NCAAB games. Since the lack of a listed time is a relatively rare occurrence, I feel this will only be encountered a few times, and likely won't be a dangerous assumption since we aren't changing anything specific to the game itself (ie. changing the score, or 3-pointers or some other field that would be used in a statistical analysis).\r\n\r\nI already have a fix for this, and am able to run all of the sample code you listed with the new updates. I am performing some final tests now, but will create a PR for this shortly to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am incredibly sorry for my delay here, but thank you so much for creating the issue as it really helps shape this project and make it better than ever!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/527224344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2601707533,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwMTcwNzUzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2601707533","actor":{"login":"alokpattani","id":51244947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjQ0OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51244947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani","html_url":"https://github.com/alokpattani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T18:56:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2601707534,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDE3MDc1MzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2601707534","actor":{"login":"alokpattani","id":51244947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjQ0OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51244947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani","html_url":"https://github.com/alokpattani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alokpattani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T18:56:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2601740644,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYwMTc0MDY0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2601740644","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T19:31:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
