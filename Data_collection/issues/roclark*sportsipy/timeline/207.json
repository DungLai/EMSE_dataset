an update, it looks like the team at sports-reference.com either added more places where the score is displayed on the page, and/or changed the IDs for the existing points totals, throwing off the indexing I was using while grabbing the home and away scores. Luckily, this is an easy fix as I can just query the first and last score that is retrieved as those will be the away and home, respectively. As mentioned, I will create a small patch for this, but am in the process of migrating from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions for my testing suite, and will probably want to merge that prior to any new updates since the project is in an interesting transition period between the two at the moment (shouldn't be long).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/536794614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/536968792","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/207#issuecomment-536968792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/207","id":536968792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjk2ODc5Mg==","user":{"login":"joaonobre","id":26253489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjUzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26253489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre","html_url":"https://github.com/joaonobre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaonobre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T10:12:37Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T10:12:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"No problem!
