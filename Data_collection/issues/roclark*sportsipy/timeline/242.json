@pringithub, thanks for bringing this up! I have a couple of questions for you:\r\n\r\n1. What sport are you referring to? I would assume NCAAB and/or NCAAF?\r\n2. Do you have an idea of how you would ideally like this to be implemented? For example, do you want something like a Boolean operator which specifies whether a team made a tournament? ie:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nteam.made_tournament = True\r\n```\r\nAlso, same goes for having won the championship - I would assume a Boolean is appropriate here?\r\n\r\nThanks again for opening this issue! This sounds like a great enhancement and I will put it on my roadmap!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/553206764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2793669321,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc5MzY2OTMyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2793669321","actor":{"login":"pringithub","id":10574422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc0NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10574422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub","html_url":"https://github.com/pringithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T02:17:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2793669323,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3OTM2NjkzMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2793669323","actor":{"login":"pringithub","id":10574422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc0NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10574422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub","html_url":"https://github.com/pringithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T02:17:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/553987352","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/242#issuecomment-553987352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/242","id":553987352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mzk4NzM1Mg==","user":{"login":"pringithub","id":10574422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc0NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10574422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub","html_url":"https://github.com/pringithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pringithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T17:14:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T17:14:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure\r\n\r\nSo
