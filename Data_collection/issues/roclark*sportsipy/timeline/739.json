I did not pull down the fix that I posted earlier.\r\n\r\nIf you navigate to where you have your modules stored on your local machine, find the 'sportsipy' module and got into it. Then go into the 'nfl' module and click on the 'constants.py' scripts.\r\n\r\nWithin that script navigate to line 81 and change this line of code:\r\n'home_name': 'a[itemprop=\"name\"]:first',\r\nTo this:\r\n'home_name': 'div[class=\"linescore_wrap\"] table tbody tr:last td:nth-child(2)',\r\n\r\nNext go to line 84 and change this line of code:\r\n'away_name': 'a[itemprop=\"name\"]:last',\r\nTo this:\r\n'away_name': 'div[class=\"linescore_wrap\"] table tbody tr:first td:nth-child(2)',\r\n\r\nAfter changing it, save the script, navigate to your script that was throwing the error and run it again.\r\nIt should work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything was not clear or if it does not work, I will try and help more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1193724160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RichardSJTotten","id":29128043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTI4MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29128043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardSJTotten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7054136716,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB-gj585NzHTWzwAAAAGkdZWM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/7054136716","actor":{"login":"westaa","id":14284316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg0MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14284316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa","html_url":"https://github.com/westaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T08:08:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7054136721,"node_id":"SE_lADOB-gj585NzHTWzwAAAAGkdZWR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/7054136721","actor":{"login":"westaa","id":14284316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg0MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14284316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa","html_url":"https://github.com/westaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/westaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T08:08:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7054136730,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB-gj585NzHTWzwAAAAGkdZWa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/7054136730","actor":{"login":"RichardSJTotten","id":29128043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTI4MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29128043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardSJTotten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardSJTotten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-25T08:08:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7054136737,"node_id":"SE_lADOB-gj585NzHTWzwAAAAGkdZWh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/7054136737","actor":{"login":
