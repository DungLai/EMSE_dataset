Thanks for the question! To help me better understand, are you wondering if it is possible to get the schedule of a team for seasons outside of the current or most recent (as in, get a team's schedule during the year 2000)? If so, the `Schedule` class has an optional second parameter which can be used to specify a particular year. The following code grabs Michigan State's basketball schedule from the 2011 season:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.schedule import Schedule\r\n\r\n# Grab MSU's schedule from the 2010-11 season\r\nmsu_schedule = Schedule('MICHIGAN-STATE', year='2011')\r\nfor game in msu_schedule:\r\n    print(game.date)  # Prints the date the game was played\r\n    print(game.result)  # Prints whether the team won or lost\r\n    # Creates an instance of the Boxscore class for the game.\r\n    boxscore = game.boxscore\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this what you are looking for? Or is there further functionality that you desire?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/473277610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2206383733,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIwNjM4MzczMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2206383733","actor":{"login":"tylerjlawson","id":26290074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjkwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26290074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson","html_url":"https://github.com/tylerjlawson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-15T13:03:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2206383736,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMDYzODM3MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2206383736","actor":{"login":"tylerjlawson","id":26290074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjkwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26290074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson","html_url":"https://github.com/tylerjlawson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-15T13:03:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/473399237","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56#issuecomment-473399237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56","id":473399237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM5OTIzNw==","user":{"login":"tylerjlawson","id":26290074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjkwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26290074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson","html_url":"https://github.com/tylerjlawson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T18:38:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T18:38:31Z","author_association":"N

found out where this issue originates from. The code pulls the team's gamelog (ex. for the [Celtics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2019/gamelog/)) which only includes information up to the most recently completed game for the team. I originally chose the game log since it contained more information for each game which could be included without going down to the `boxscore` level. Unfortunately, since I wrote the code during the offseason, I didn't realize they only show part of the schedule instead of the entire slate of games.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, I think it is preferred to have the entire schedule instead of just the completed games (and this is the functionality of most other sports in the API), so I will change the affected sports to use the schedule page (ex. schedule for the [Celtics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2019_games.html)). This will lower the amount of information that is presented in the `Game` class in the `schedule` module, but that information is still accessible by going down to the `boxscore` level if desired, so I think that's an OK tradeoff.\r\n\r\nI will work on updating this code and creating a patch.

attention!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/473482251/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/474056815","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56#issuecomment-474056815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56","id":474056815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDA1NjgxNQ==","user":{"login":"tylerjlawson","id":26290074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjkwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26290074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson","html_url":"https://github.com/tylerjlawson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T19:00:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:00:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If

So, nothing is wrong with how you are using the code, but just wanted to give a warning that the actual date output looks different now.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any concerns with this, otherwise I will get you a new release!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/475091984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2218643438,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIyMTg2NDM0Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2218643438","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-21T02:11:38Z","milestone":{"title":"Release 0.4.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/475474034","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56#issuecomment-475474034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/56","id":475474034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTQ3NDAzNA==","user":{"login":"tylerjlawson","id":26290074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjkwMDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26290074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson","html_url":"https://github.com/tylerjlawson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylerjlawson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T02:39:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T02:39:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you!
