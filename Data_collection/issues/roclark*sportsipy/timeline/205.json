Thanks for bringing this to my attention! I was unaware that some players had different formats for their Player ID. This is a puzzling one, as I'm not sure what the best way to resolve this would be, outside of updating the documentation to indicate the different formats an ID can take on. In general, the Player ID is either referenced from the player's unique page, or pulled programmatically through a team's roster, so there's flexibility with how it can be supplied, but I would like to address this scenario in case any user supplies what they believe is a valid ID when the website uses a different format. Perhaps a good way to resolve this would be to mention the 10-character format in the documentation, and also add a more useful error message which suggests the other format in case the user supplies an invalid one. Any thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nThanks again for writing this up! This is a very important clarification and I want to sort out a lot of the usage semantics prior to the official 1.0.0 release (which is very much TBD at this point).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/536322946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2671349004,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3MTM0OTAwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2671349004","actor":{"login":"jtrueblood","id":2021876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2021876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood","html_url":"https://github.com/jtrueblood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T17:29:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671349005,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NzEzNDkwMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2671349005","actor":{"login":"jtrueblood","id":2021876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2021876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood","html_url":"https://github.com/jtrueblood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrueblood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T17:29:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671349094,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNjcxMzQ5MDk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2671349094","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T17:29:51Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https:

Thanks for replying so quickly.  I'm sure revising the documentation would help others in the future.  I think this issue may be more fundamental than just documentation though.  In another example, when I just print out the whole team roster -- for instance the Falcons for this season...\r\n\r\n`team = Roster('ATL')\r\nfor player in team.players:\r\n\tprint(player.name, player.player_id)`\r\n\r\nMatt Bryant returns the longer form player_id (same as his profootball ref URI) and the name comes back as 'None'.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/caa8z97zesaxs3a/screen-shot.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nAnd if you pass back that URI that is listed in the Roster response for Bryant, you get the error I mentioned above.  So even calling the roster for the proper player_id doesn't seem to work either.  It appears that the player data for players with this id format is inaccessible.  \r\n\r\nThanks again for your work on this.
