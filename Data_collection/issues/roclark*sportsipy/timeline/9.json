I can see many valuable reasons to include the ability to read offline content and think this is a good feature to include in the future. I have to admit, I never considered this when I first thought up the project, but it makes a lot of sense now that you mention it.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to discuss the implementation part further to make sure I fully understand your ideas, and to ensure we do this the right way. I agree, I think adding something in `utils.py` that is able to determine where to read the HTML from would be wise. Using the current class structures, do you envision having a user add a parameter to specify the HTML location while instantiating a class? For example, to get the NCAAB teams using local HTML files, run something like the following?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.teams import Teams\r\n\r\nfor team in Teams(html=\"path/to/local/html\"):\r\n    print(\"I read %s's info from a local file!\" % team.name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny more advice or thoughts would be much appreciated! Or, feel free to mock up an example or create a pull request and I'd be happy to check it out! Otherwise, I will keep this here and add it to my roadmap for inclusion in a future release.\r\n\r\nThanks again for using this repository and opening this issue, I greatly appreciate all of the feedback I can get!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/435717227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1945068530,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk0NTA2ODUzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/1945068530","actor":{"login":"hodger","id":10540084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10540084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger","html_url":"https://github.com/hodger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-04T23:06:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1945068531,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NDUwNjg1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/1945068531","actor":{"login":"hodger","id":10540084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10540084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger","html_url":"https://github.com/hodger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-04T23:06:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/435732364","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/9#issuecomment-435732364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/9","id":435732364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTczMjM2NA==","user":{"login":"hodger","id":10540084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10540084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger","html_url":"https://github.com/hodger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hodger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T01:54:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T01:54:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
