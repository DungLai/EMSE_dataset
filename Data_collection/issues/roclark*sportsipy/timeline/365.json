@denutza! Thanks for creating the issue! I just took a look, and there's something weird going on with Bryant University around that year. Apparently, they started their transition to Division-I basketball a couple years before, and fully converted a couple years later (at least, according to their [basketball Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant_Bulldogs_men's_basketball)). Looking at sports-reference.com, they are listed in the school stats sections for 2010, but they don't have an individual school page that year, causing them to not be populated in the dictionary containing conference details, and throwing the `KeyError` you ran into.\r\n\r\nI was able to make a quick patch to check if the school contains valid information before attempting to create a `Team` instance and it appears to be working correctly now. I will create a new PR with the patch shortly and get this merged in for the next release.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/606997458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3185958003,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE4NTk1ODAwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3185958003","actor":{"login":"denutza","id":14910352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTEwMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14910352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza","html_url":"https://github.com/denutza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-01T02:53:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3185958005,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxODU5NTgwMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3185958005","actor":{"login":"denutza","id":14910352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTEwMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14910352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza","html_url":"https://github.com/denutza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-01T02:53:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3186020465,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE4NjAyMDQ2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3186020465","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-01T03:29:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/607115587","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/365#issuecomment-607115587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/365","id":607115587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYw
