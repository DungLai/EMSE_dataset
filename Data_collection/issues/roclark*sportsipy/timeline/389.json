I just initiated a publishing task which should complete in a few hours, then you can update to the latest binary and try again where it should work for you. I will update here when I've tried out the new binary and let you know.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/611764657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3220054487,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIyMDA1NDQ4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3220054487","actor":{"login":"Maths-Lad","id":63360288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzYwMjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63360288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad","html_url":"https://github.com/Maths-Lad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-09T21:36:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3220054491,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMjAwNTQ0OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3220054491","actor":{"login":"Maths-Lad","id":63360288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzYwMjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63360288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad","html_url":"https://github.com/Maths-Lad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maths-Lad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-09T21:36:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/611774469","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/389#issuecomment-611774469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/389","id":611774469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTc3NDQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T22:02:24Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T22:02:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Looks
