@cvauclair, thanks for creating this issue and bringing this to my attention! I apologize for the delay here, and fortunately/unfortunately, it appears this has resolved itself as I am able to run your code and get the Hornet's 2018 roster without errors. My guess is the page on sports-reference.com was invalid for a time, causing the error here, but has since been restored by the sports-reference team.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling though since we are prone to future issues like this if another roster becomes invalid at some point. As such, I created a little patch that should handle this error if a similar situation comes up. THANK YOU for the detailed report as I was able to track this down and create a patch, even though it isn't reproducible anymore.\r\n\r\nI will merge the patch shortly so we can get this resolved for the future, but please let me know if you are still running into issues and I will take a deeper look into this.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/605217255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3173695254,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE3MzY5NTI1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3173695254","actor":{"login":"cvauclair","id":3653954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTM5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3653954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair","html_url":"https://github.com/cvauclair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:07:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3173695256,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNzM2OTUyNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3173695256","actor":{"login":"cvauclair","id":3653954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTM5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3653954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair","html_url":"https://github.com/cvauclair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvauclair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:07:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3173786230,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE3Mzc4NjIzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3173786230","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-27T19:34:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
