Yes, this is an issue that was raised in #393 and has been patched with #399. With the latest master branch, the following now works:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nfl.roster import Player\r\n\r\nweight = Player('DorsKe01').weight\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince he doesn't have a weight listed on his page, `weight` will be `None`.\r\n\r\nOnce I drop the next release, scheduled for version 0.6.0, this will be included with the new binaries. In the meantime, feel free to use the latest source code.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/619427377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3272206157,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI3MjIwNjE1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3272206157","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-25T19:12:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3272206162,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3MjIwNjE2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3272206162","actor":{"login":"calebrichards","id":47101747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTAxNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47101747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/calebrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-25T19:12:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3272206163,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzIyMDYxNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3272206163","actor":{"login":"calebrichards","id":47101747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTAxNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47101747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/calebrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-25T19:12:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3272206275,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyNzIyMDYyNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3272206275
