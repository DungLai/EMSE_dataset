From what I've found so far, the website I am scraping from doesn't necessarily have the best contract/salary information, but I can do some more digging. Any particular sport you are interested in getting this info for? If so, perhaps that will motivate me to work on that sport first. :smile:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/407622334/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/407624365","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/1#issuecomment-407624365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/1","id":407624365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzYyNDM2NQ==","user":{"login":"weallwegot","id":13176059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot","html_url":"https://github.com/weallwegot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weallwegot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-25T03:46:37Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T03:46:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"oh awesome sounds good!

I can certainly add this to a future release. Are you thinking of a specific page? Perhaps the [all NHL current salaries](https://www.hockey-reference.com/friv/current_nhl_salaries.cgi) or [individual team salaries](https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/2019_salary-cap.html)? Or is there a different page that you desire?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/459761566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2112483211,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjExMjQ4MzIxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2112483211","actor":{"login":"romainmartinez","id":17710617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzEwNjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17710617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez","html_url":"https://github.com/romainmartinez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T15:32:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2112483212,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxMTI0ODMyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2112483212","actor":{"login":"romainmartinez","id":17710617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzEwNjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17710617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez","html_url":"https://github.com/romainmartinez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romainmartinez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-01T15:32:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
