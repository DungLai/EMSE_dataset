It might be of use to you all.\r\n\r\nI just worked my way through this issue -- I believe the format for boxscore pages has changed on sports reference. \r\n\r\n@roclark I have it running locally by updating the `away_record` & `home_record` parts of the `BOXSCORE_SCHEME` to `div#boxes div[class*=\"assoc_box-score-basic-\"] h2`. I also updated `_parse_record`  in boxscore.py to \r\n```\r\n        records = boxscore(BOXSCORE_SCHEME[field])\r\n        records = [x.text for x in records if x.text != ''] \r\n        \r\n        if len(records) > index:\r\n            return records[index]\r\n        else:\r\n            return ''\r\n ```\r\n\r\nNot positive this is the _correct_ way to fix the issue, but it's working for me. Great project by the way! I'd been trying to parse manually prior to finding it. \r\n\r\nEdit: apologies for the double @, roclark!
