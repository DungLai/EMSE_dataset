Thanks for creating this issue, and for the great ideas! A lot of the suggestions you requested here are now part of the standard `sportsreference` package, and it should be easier to determine what each object represents, and to access specific teams. I am going to close this as this is now complete, but thanks again for the great suggestions, and apologies for not getting to this sooner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/699656268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3811798641,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzgxMTc5ODY0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3811798641","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T16:25:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3811798643,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgxMTc5ODY0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3811798643","actor":{"login":"baogorek","id":2700556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDA1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2700556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek","html_url":"https://github.com/baogorek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T16:25:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3811798644,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MTE3OTg2NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3811798644","actor":{"login":"baogorek","id":2700556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDA1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2700556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek","html_url":"https://github.com/baogorek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baogorek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-27T16:25:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3811798801,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4MTE3OTg4MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3811798801","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent
