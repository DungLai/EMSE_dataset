I’ve had lots of issues parsing the game meta information for all sports. I can confirm that I’m seeing what you see on my end as well. I will try and dig deeper tomorrow to see if the bowl games interfere with the parsing scheme, or if this also appears in other sports. I will let you know what I find and create a fix for this and include it with a patch release of

created PR #49 which updates the parsing scheme to properly pull boxscore information from sports-reference.com. I originally used a scheme that had an expected layout of information on the page, but whenever that changes, the incorrect information would be populated in the class properties. This problem just became visible since it appears sports-reference.com removed the game time from the boxscore page, which threw off the scheme. The new scheme is much more flexible, but unfortunately it looks like the time will no longer be applied for some games since it was removed from the site.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/450502959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2048149121,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA0ODE0OTEyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2048149121","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-29T16:52:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2048150310,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIwNDgxNTAzMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2048150310","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-29T16:56:37Z","milestone":{"title":"Release 0.3.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
