The table ID's on the website changed and it was unable to pull any information as many of you found. I was able to create a patch and pushed PR #644 which should resolve the issues here. Targeting that branch, I am now able to run the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsipy.nba.teams import Teams\r\n\r\nteams = Teams()\r\nfor team in teams:\r\n    print(team.name, team.abbreviation)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich has the following output\r\n\r\n```\r\nMilwaukee Bucks MIL\r\nBrooklyn Nets BRK\r\nWashington Wizards WAS\r\nUtah Jazz UTA\r\nPortland Trail Blazers POR\r\nIndiana Pacers IND\r\nPhoenix Suns PHO\r\nDenver Nuggets DEN\r\nNew Orleans Pelicans NOP\r\nLos Angeles Clippers LAC\r\nSacramento Kings SAC\r\nGolden State Warriors GSW\r\nAtlanta Hawks ATL\r\nPhiladelphia 76ers PHI\r\nMemphis Grizzlies MEM\r\nBoston Celtics BOS\r\nDallas Mavericks DAL\r\nMinnesota Timberwolves MIN\r\nToronto Raptors TOR\r\nSan Antonio Spurs SAS\r\nChicago Bulls CHI\r\nLos Angeles Lakers LAL\r\nCharlotte Hornets CHO\r\nHouston Rockets HOU\r\nMiami Heat MIA\r\nNew York Knicks NYK\r\nDetroit Pistons DET\r\nOklahoma City Thunder OKC\r\nOrlando Magic ORL\r\nCleveland Cavaliers CLE\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for the patience and the debugging efforts!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/903392599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5191671330,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ1MTkxNjcxMzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/5191671330","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T02:16:42Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5191671388,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUxOTE2NzEzODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/5191671388","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-23T02:16:44Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5191671466,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUxOTE2NzE0NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/5191671466","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gist
