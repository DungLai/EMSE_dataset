As mentioned in #254, the latest wheel released on PyPI (version 0.4.6) does _not_ have the fix yet, but the upstream master should be working now as the patch has been merged with that branch. Once I cut another release (which will be very soon at this point), you should be able to use the latest wheel, but in the meantime, source should work (I just ran the code below using the latest master code):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nfl.teams import Teams\r\n\r\nteams = Teams()\r\nfor team in teams:\r\n    print(team.name)\r\n    print(team.margin_of_victory)\r\n\r\nBaltimore Ravens\r\n14.5\r\nKansas City Chiefs\r\n4.7\r\nSan Francisco 49ers\r\n14.0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you try the upstream code, however, and find that it too doesn't work, please let me know. Otherwise, I will close this as the fix should already be working.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/556001601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2815234325,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgxNTIzNDMyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2815234325","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-20T13:23:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2815234346,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgxNTIzNDM0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2815234346","actor":{"login":"oneshotbob","id":53715473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzE1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53715473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob","html_url":"https://github.com/oneshotbob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-20T13:23:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2815234347,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MTUyMzQzNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2815234347","actor":{"login":"oneshotbob","id":53715473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzE1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53715473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob","html_url":"https://github.com/oneshotbob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oneshotbob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-20T13:23:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
