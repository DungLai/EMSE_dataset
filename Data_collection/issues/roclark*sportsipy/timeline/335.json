@llrantzll, thanks for the request! That's awesome that you work as a performance coach! And even better to marry that with programming! ðŸ˜ƒ\r\n\r\nI've been eagerly following the development of FBref on sports-reference.com and wanting to support it in this package, but both didn't have time and also wanted to wait for the site to mature a bit.
