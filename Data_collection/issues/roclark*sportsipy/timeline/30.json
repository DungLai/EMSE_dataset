I was thinking the same. I will have to think of a way to be able to query the data from the `Team` class since it relies on the `Teams` class pulling data, but I think I can create a way to get the information straight from the `Team` class and populate the properties from that page. I will add this to my roadmap and include it with a future release.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!\r\n\r\nBTW, it looks like there are a ton of duplicates for this issue.

- I’ve been looking at this further, and after several tests, I’ve found that it actually isn’t efficient to query a single team from the `Team` class as opposed to pulling all of the teams, then calling the desired team from the `Teams` class. The reason being, the critical path in getting the information is pulling the page from sports-reference.com. Since this is a one-time hit for each page, it is easier to pull multiple teams with the data that is already captured instead of going to individual team pages and pulling there. In order to implement this, a major refactor if not complete rewrite of the `Team` class would be required. Lastly, the individual team’s page contains different stats than what’s currently presented from the class.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I think it’s best I keep the code as-is for now. I will continually monitor the code and determine whether or not it can benefit from a rewrite, but in the meantime, I will close this issue. If I come up with a way to make this more efficient while still exposing the same properties, I will re-open this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the
