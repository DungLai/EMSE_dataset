Looks like none of the NCAAF player pages contain a position in the career stats field, so all players show as having no position by default. I created a fix for this by pulling the most recent season's position whenever the career position cannot be found. From my testing, this is the same as the position listed in the information panel at the top of each page, so it should be consistent.\r\n\r\nI pushed a fix to the repository just a bit ago, but I want to take care of some other un-related tests that are failing at the moment before I merge it. Thanks again for the help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/517703098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2529687104,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUyOTY4NzEwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2529687104","actor":{"login":"soySmelliot","id":17421205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDIxMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17421205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot","html_url":"https://github.com/soySmelliot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T13:35:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2529687105,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1Mjk2ODcxMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2529687105","actor":{"login":"soySmelliot","id":17421205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDIxMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17421205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot","html_url":"https://github.com/soySmelliot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T13:35:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2529689426,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI1Mjk2ODk0MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2529689426","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T13:36:20Z","milestone":{"title":"Release
