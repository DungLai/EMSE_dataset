To make sure I understand correctly, are you wanting to find a particular player’s season or career stats on a particular day, such I as Tom Brady’s stats after week 3 (ie. games 1-3, but no others)? If so, this package doesn’t support that functionality unfortunately as the website is updated daily with the latest information.\r\n\r\nOne way to potentially get around this, however, is to pull all relevant stats in the morning on a daily basis and run any algorithms or append a dataset with changes. Not a perfect solution, but it could work depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you could check the player’s stats for every game in a particular range and sum the stats. Perhaps that would work?\r\n\r\nGiven how the website updates, I won’t be able to add this feature, sadly, unless they make changes to viewing data in more of a time-series format or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/604209432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3166562098,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE2NjU2MjA5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3166562098","actor":{"login":"gabespound","id":16771310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzcxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16771310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound","html_url":"https://github.com/gabespound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T03:34:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3166562100,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNjY1NjIxMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3166562100","actor":{"login":"gabespound","id":16771310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzcxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16771310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound","html_url":"https://github.com/gabespound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabespound/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T03:34:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/609471292","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/345#issuecomment-609471292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/345","id":609471292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQ3MTI5Mg==","user":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-05T19:42:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T19:42:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing
