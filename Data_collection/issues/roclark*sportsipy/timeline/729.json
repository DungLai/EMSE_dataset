to fix the problem that I had, which seems almost identical to yours, is I changed the sportsipy module directly on my hard drive. I did not pull down the fix that I posted earlier.\r\n\r\nIf you navigate to where you have your modules stored on your local machine, find the 'sportsipy' module and got into it. Then go into the 'nfl' module and click on the 'constants.py' scripts.\r\n\r\nWithin that script navigate to line 81 and change this line of code:\r\n'home_name': 'a[itemprop=\"name\"]:first',\r\nTo this:\r\n'home_name': 'div[class=\"linescore_wrap\"] table tbody tr:last td:nth-child(2)',\r\n\r\nNext go to line 84 and change this line of code:\r\n'away_name': 'a[itemprop=\"name\"]:last',\r\nTo this:\r\n'away_name': 'div[class=\"linescore_wrap\"] table tbody tr:first td:nth-child(2)',\r\n\r\nAfter changing it, save the script, navigate to your script that was throwing the error and run it again.\r\nIt should work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything was not clear or if it does not work, I will try and help
