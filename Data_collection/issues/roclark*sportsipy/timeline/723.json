but if you dig into a player object it has all stats populated*.  \r\nSo I added another change around those lines to populate the names also; I added `player_instance._name = self._get_name(player)` after the Player instance is created in line 1876 of the same file.  \r\nThis is obviously not the best solution, `_name` was supposed to be set in `_parse_player_information`, but it's a quick and dirty fix to get us unstuck :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\* `'_most_recent_season'` wasn't set correctly in the one I checked:\r\n```\r\n>>> player\r\nNone (AdamMi21)\r\n>>> player.__dict__\r\n{'_most_recent_season': '2011', ..., '_player_id': 'AdamMi21', '_season': ['2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', 'Career'], ...}\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1126602198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cbdm","id":5800179,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDAxNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5800179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm","html_url":"https://github.com/cbdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbdm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
