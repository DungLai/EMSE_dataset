had this issue as well, it appears that any 2021 boxscores have different HTML than previous seasons at least from looking at it myself.  If you look at the API, def _parse_record(self, field, boxscore, index) in boxscore.py tries to return the records of the teams that played but it isn't able to find any records from the PyQuery object, so there is an empty list that it is trying to index (at least this is where mine gets stuck).  If you don't need the records, you can edit this function locally as a temporary fix, the path for me on linux is: /home/insertUsernameHere/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sportsipy/ncaab/boxscore.py","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/962339139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshbliss","id":51925076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTI1MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51925076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbliss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbliss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
