Thanks for notifying me of the issue, and especially thanks for the follow-on debugging. You are absolutely right about the page being valid but empty, throwing the error. I think given this scenario just before the start of a season when the pages are live but empty, it would be wise to print a message that no information is available yet for the requested season and handle the errors gracefully. I think this would be preferable to reverting to the previous year in this scenario as some users might want to just know if no information is ready yet. I will get working on a fix for this.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/522275802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2564180766,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU2NDE4MDc2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564180766","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T22:40:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564180767,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NjQxODA3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564180767","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T22:40:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564180775,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNTY0MTgwNzc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564180775","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T22:40:43Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564180788,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NjQxODA3ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564180788","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T22:40:45Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"p
