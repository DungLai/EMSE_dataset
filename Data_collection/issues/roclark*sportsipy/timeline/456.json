@jdcarbon, thanks for creating this! I looked into the code, and it appears that in cases where there isn't any player info, such as for Jontay Porter in the recent season, the section where many of the common `Player` attributes (such as `minutes_played`, `points`, etc.) does not get initialized when there isn't any data to parse from the player's page, which is why you ran into this issue. I made a very small change to the code and will create an update to resolve the issue soon once the tests pass. This will allow your code above to continue as expected while filling in the missing values with `None` as intended.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/710640819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3888209112,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4ODIwOTExMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3888209112","actor":{"login":"jdcarbon","id":25761590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzYxNTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25761590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon","html_url":"https://github.com/jdcarbon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T21:11:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3888209117,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODgyMDkxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3888209117","actor":{"login":"jdcarbon","id":25761590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzYxNTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25761590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon","html_url":"https://github.com/jdcarbon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdcarbon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T21:11:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3888680653,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg4ODY4MDY1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3888680653","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-17T01:20:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
