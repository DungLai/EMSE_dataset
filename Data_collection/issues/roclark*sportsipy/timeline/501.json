you both for the feedback! You are both spot-on about the abbreviations being the cause of the issue here, and I agree that it will continue to be an issue as various teams change their names and/or move. I found a fairly quick fix to this and will push an update soon once all of the tests pass. Essentially, I do a secondary pull of the abbreviations shown on the actual page (as opposed to just the URIs) and compare those abbreviations with the ones listed in the tables. In my testing, this works both for the code that @mdekarske provided above, as well as previous seasons that I tested and the correct number of players are returned for both home and away.\r\n\r\nThanks again!
