This is a puzzling issue, but it appears this is caused by the `Boxscore` class pulling the wrong record for the home team. It looks like the code is actually pulling the away team's record for the older games, which is why the numbers look off in the 2017-18 season. Luckily, I believe this is a pretty straightforward fix to get the right record. I will let you know when this is resolved. Thanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/553208426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2793680373,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc5MzY4MDM3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2793680373","actor":{"login":"Renaldas55","id":56148524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTQ4NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56148524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55","html_url":"https://github.com/Renaldas55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T02:24:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2793680375,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3OTM2ODAzNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2793680375","actor":{"login":"Renaldas55","id":56148524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTQ4NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56148524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55","html_url":"https://github.com/Renaldas55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T02:24:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2793680419,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNzkzNjgwNDE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2793680419","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-13T02:24:44Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"htt

I looked into this further, and I think I misinterpreted the question a bit. I found that the indexing was indeed incorrect in some scenarios (and have a fix coming), but I had to take another look at the definition of `home_wins`:\r\n\r\n> Returns an `int` of the number of games the home team has won after the conclusion of the game.\r\n\r\nWhile this is similar to a counter, it won't monotonically increase given it will show the season wins for the _home_ team after every game, and not just the team that is being queried. With this in mind, here's a breakdown of the beginning of Orlando's schedule in the 2017-18 season:\r\n  * **Game 1:** Home Team: Magic, Home Team's Record: 1-0, `home_wins`: 1\r\n  * **Game 2:** Home Team: Nets, Home Team's Record: 1-1, `home_wins`: 1\r\n  * **Game 3:** Home Team: Cavaliers, Home Team's Record: 2-1, `home_wins`: 2\r\n  * **Game 4:** Home Team: Magic, Home Team's Record: 3-1, `home_wins`: 3\r\n  * **Game 5:** Home Team: Magic, Home Team's Record: 4-1, `home_wins`: 4\r\n  * **Game 6:** Home Team: Hornets, Home Team's Record: 3-3, `home_wins`: 3\r\n\r\nNotice that the number went down after game 6 in the Magic's schedule after they played the Hornets (with a worse record at the time) on the road. `home_wins` in this case refers to the Hornet's 3 games they've won during the season.\r\n\r\nWith all this being said, as I mentioned at the top, there's still an issue with the indexing that I need to fix in some scenarios and I will get something out shortly.\r\n\r\nThanks again for creating this issue and bringing it to my attention!
