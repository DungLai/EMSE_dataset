I used NFL and now using NBA.\r\n\r\nI am encountering the same issue with a caveat. every so often, I get a home_win of 76. otherwise, all are set to 0.

I'm not good enough to follow the scraping code, but I suspect it is the regular expression is catching the 76 in 76ers team name. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny boxscore for a non-76ers team I get 0 for the value.\r\n\r\naway_wins works as expected and appears to have correct values.\r\n \r\nany help would be appreciated.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/921407921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DoubleBarrelBirds","id":90881876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODgxODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90881876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds","html_url":"https://github.com/DoubleBarrelBirds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
