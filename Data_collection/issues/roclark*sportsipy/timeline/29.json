Sorry you ran into this, but I'm grateful you are a Bama fan and tried this out, because it identified a bug in the code that won't showup for most other schools. :smile: While troubleshooting this, I found that the code was able to parse _some_ players on Alabama's roster, but not all. The specific culprit appears to be Javian Davis-Fleming. If you look at his [player page](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/javian-davis-fleming-1.html), it contains no stats, and the code threw an error while trying to parse certain stats tables from the page when they don't exist. I will add some more error checkers to the `Roster` and `Player` classes to prevent this error from being thrown, and attempt to pull as much information from each player as I can, regardless of how little that may be.\r\n\r\nSince this is a bug that limits functionality of the code, I will work on a patch release to fix this immediately. Thanks again!\r\n\r\nBTW, best of luck to the Crimson Tide this weekend!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/450206598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2046282434,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA0NjI4MjQzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2046282434","actor":{"login":"jcurrey","id":6664595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey","html_url":"https://github.com/jcurrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-27T18:35:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2046282435,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNDYyODI0MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2046282435","actor":{"login":"jcurrey","id":6664595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey","html_url":"https://github.com/jcurrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcurrey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-27T18:35:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2046282499,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyMDQ2MjgyNDk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2046282499","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-27T18:35:19Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.
