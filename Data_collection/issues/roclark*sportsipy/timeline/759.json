One consideration you might want to make, is dumping the dictionary into a stringified JSON and including it as a field in the output dataframe. \r\n\r\nThat said, this repo appears to be abandoned by the admin. I have a [fork](https://github.com/bveber/pysportsref) that I'm using for my own purposes and I'm in the process of updating the codebase to accomodate several changes that have been made to the website that have broken some features. If you implement this change you might be better off forking it yourself. But I'm interested in seeing your changes when you make them and I'd be happy to collaborate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1322350080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bveber","id":7477173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NzcxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7477173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber","html_url":"https://github.com/bveber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
