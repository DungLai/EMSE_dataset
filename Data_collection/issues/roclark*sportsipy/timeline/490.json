all, thanks for bringing this to my attention and for offering to support! This has actually been fixed as of #480 as the tables on sports-reference.com were updated and the old method of pulling information was broken. With the latest version of the upstream code, both the `Schedule` and `Roster` (plus `Team`) classes should work as expected with valid output. These updates will be included with the 0.6.0 release which I hope to put out relatively soon. If you desire to use the updated code now, you can pull/build the source according to the README. I will be closing this given the mentioned update, but if there are further issues, feel free to re-open or create a new issue and I will look into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/710179554/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3887225708,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg4NzIyNTcwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3887225708","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-16T16:28:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1372230452","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/490#issuecomment-1372230452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/490","id":1372230452,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-gj585RypM0","user":{"login":"ericmk52","id":47303868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzAzODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47303868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52","html_url":"https://github.com/ericmk52","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericmk52/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T13:42:28Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T13:42:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, \n\nI am not sure if you have used the sportsipy package recently, but when I try to run the current schedules for teams, I am receiving the same error.
