This is not currently possible in this API, but I think it would be nice to add. I don't know if it would be wise to fully integrate the two, as that would add a lot of overhead, but perhaps linking the NFL/College `player_id` as you mention, then users can use that ID to pull the College/NFL stats (if they exist).\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing! I will try and include this with a future release!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/623026503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3296884878,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI5Njg4NDg3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3296884878","actor":{"login":"calebrichards","id":47101747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTAxNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47101747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/calebrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-02T22:58:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3296884880,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyOTY4ODQ4ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3296884880","actor":{"login":"calebrichards","id":47101747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTAxNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47101747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/calebrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebrichards/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-02T22:58:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
