As of one of the more recent updates, the `Boxscore` class now includes both a `home_players` and `away_players` property which is a list of `BoxscorePlayer` instances of every player on the home and away teams, respectively. This allows you to find per-player stats during a particular game. I am planning on updating all interfaces down the road to make it easier to work between and find various players, as I feel this part is a little clunky, but you can get the desired information with the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscore\r\n\r\ngame = Boxscore('2019-03-23-20-purdue')\r\nfor player in game.home_players:\r\n    print(player.name, player.field_goal_attempts)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will print the name and number of field goal attempts for every player on the home team (Purdue) for the game. If you only desire Carsen Edwards' stats, you could add an `if` statement in the loop, but as mentioned, I hope to make this easier down the line.\r\n\r\nIs this along the lines of what you are looking for?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/604419929/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3168160153,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE2ODE2MDE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3168160153","actor":{"login":"kmedved","id":17412221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDEyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17412221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved","html_url":"https://github.com/kmedved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T13:06:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3168160155,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxNjgxNjAxNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3168160155","actor":{"login":"kmedved","id":17412221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDEyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17412221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved","html_url":"https://github.com/kmedved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-26T13:06:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/604671075","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/341#issuecomment-604671075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/341","id":604671075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDY3MTA3NQ==","user":{"login":"kmedved","id":17412221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDEyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17412221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved","html_url":"https://github.com/kmedved","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmedved/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T20:35:40Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T20:35:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is
