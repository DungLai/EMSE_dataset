@arun1125, thanks for filing this issue! Apologies for not getting to this sooner. Sadly, it looks like this is a result of the continued pandemic as the delays in the NBA season have caused the logic used in the default season selector invalid, as the package assumes the 2021 season should be getting ready to begin at this point. @scaratozzolo gave an awesome workaround in the meantime (thanks Scott!!!) which looks like it is working for you, but I am finalizing a patch that handles the logic for this scenario and will push it out shortly.\r\n\r\nThank you both for working together to identify the issue and find a workaround!
