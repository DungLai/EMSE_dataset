I also updated `_parse_record`  in boxscore.py to \r\n```\r\n        records = boxscore(BOXSCORE_SCHEME[field])\r\n        records = [x.text for x in records if x.text != ''] \r\n        \r\n        if len(records) > index:\r\n            return records[index]\r\n        else:\r\n            return ''\r\n ```\r\n\r\nNot positive this is the _correct_ way to fix the issue, but it's working for me. Great project by the way! I'd been trying to parse manually prior to finding it.
