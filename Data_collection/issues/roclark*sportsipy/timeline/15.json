This sounds like a great idea! To make sure I understand correctly, for your examples, _all_ boxscores would be returned for those date ranges, regardless of which teams participated? If so, that sounds quite useful to me and would reduce a couple of layers in the querying as you mentioned, both speeding up processing, and reducing the memory footprint of running code. I think this makes sense as an extension to the `Boxscores` class, but am open to other suggestions. I was planning on expanding that class for one of my next updates, so this would probably be the time to incorporate this feature. I will add this to my roadmap for an upcoming release (I will post a new milestone in the coming days).\r\n\r\nThanks again! I really appreciate the feedback!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/440316516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1977682440,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5Nzc2ODI0NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/1977682440","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-20T15:36:20Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1977682482,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxOTc3NjgyNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/1977682482","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-20T15:36:22Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/441054560","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/15#issuecomment-441054560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/15","id":441054560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTA1NDU2MA==","user":{"login":"morelandjs","id":3160459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjA0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3160459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morelandjs","html_url":"https://github

that sounds good. Ideally boxscores should return a single dataframe, with the games ordered by date in one of the axes of that dataframe.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the underlying code is constructed, but one option is to have boxscores return everything by default, then it widdles down the query based on the function inputs, e.g. date range, team name, etc.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the API limits are on sports reference though. Have you ever used nflgame and/or nfldb?
