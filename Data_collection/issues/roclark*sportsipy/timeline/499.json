Do you mind explaining a bit more about the issue? I see what you mean about the extra `tr` with the date on those boxscores, but is this throwing an issue on your end? I can pull Boxscores for both 9/12 and 9/13 without errors with the latest upstream code. I'd be happy to look into this and fix something if needed.
