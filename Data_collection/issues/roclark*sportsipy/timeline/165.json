I looked over the code and the docs again and found that you are correct, there is no `pass_attempts` attribute for the NCAAF players. Looking further though, I notice that there _is_ a `attempted_passes` attribute which has the expected number of passes a player attempted during the game. For example...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaaf.boxscore import Boxscore\r\n\r\ngame_data = Boxscore('2018-01-08-georgia')\r\nhome_team = game_data.home_players\r\nfor player in home_team:\r\n    print(player.name, player.attempted_passes)\r\n```\r\nprints the number of pass attempts for every player as well as their name. In this specific example, it will print `32` attempted passes for Georgia's Jake Fromm, and `None` for all other players.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, after looking at the docs again, and especially the other attributes you mentioned, I have to admit that I'm not crazy about my original decision to name it `attempted_passes`. While the name is accurate, you generally hear it referred to as \"pass attempts\" in game or in reports after the fact. Also, it would align with `rush_attempts`. To resolve this, I think I will add a `DeprecationWarning` to `attempted_passes`, and create a duplicate attribute named `pass_attempts`. In a future release down the line, I will remove `attempted_passes` and move forward with `pass_attempts`. Is that fair?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the issue! All of these reports help to make the package as good as it can be!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/522256851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2564072262,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU2NDA3MjI2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564072262","actor":{"login":"refekt","id":39246154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39246154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt","html_url":"https://github.com/refekt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T17:35:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564072263,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NjQwNzIyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564072263","actor":{"login":"refekt","id":39246154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ2MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39246154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt","html_url":"https://github.com/refekt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refekt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T17:35:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564072287,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNTY0MDcyMjg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564072287","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T17:35:53Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/
