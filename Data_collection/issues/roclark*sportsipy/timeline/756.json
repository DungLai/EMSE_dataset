problem with Teams is it quickly fires off as many requests as there are teams, which almost immediately violates the new request limit at sports reference. I fixed it on my fork. You can see the change [here](https://github.com/bveber/pysportsref/pull/1/files#). I just created a new [utility function](https://github.com/bveber/pysportsref/blob/e6882b2d49fc2d6c2f64ad4786de6a5979f304d9/sportsipy/utils.py#L27)  that adds a time.sleep after each url request via pyquery.\r\n\r\nAs long as you don't run multiple sportsipy commands in parallel this fix should guarantee you won't exceed the new limit. Obviously it's not ideal for NCAAB since fetching 300 teams will take ~15 minutes, but at least it works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1318180771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bveber","id":7477173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NzcxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7477173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber","html_url":"https://github.com/bveber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1318824639","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/756#issuecomment-1318824639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/756","id":1318824639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-gj585Om6q_","user":{"login":"jrclegg2","id":32072035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDcyMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32072035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2","html_url":"https://github.com/jrclegg2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrclegg2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T15:41:21Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T15:41:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I mean I'm also having an issue to boxscores, which is more concerning.\r\n\r\nMy teams fix is a `time.sleep(13)` in `_retrieve_all_teams`, around line 1130.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to train a model with boxscores back to '07.

out this [PR](https://github.com/bveber/pysportsref/pull/1/files#) for specific details). I don't think your use case of bulk downloading data for several years at once is really an option anymore unless you're willing to wait a really long time for the results. You'll be better off scheduling a long running job and caching all the historical data you intend to re-use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1322360349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bveber","id":7477173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NzcxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7477173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber","html_url":"https://github.com/bveber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bveber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/1343622053","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/756#issuecomment-1343622053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/756","id":1343622053,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-gj585QFgul","user":{"login":"kankshat","id":52341392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzQxMzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52341392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat","html_url":"https://github.com/kankshat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kankshat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-09T00:21:54Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T00:21:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Going to try adding time.sleep(60) in between requests for roster/boxscore data, let me know if you have any success with workarounds as well\r\n\r\nJust ran into this problem as well.
