You have a great idea in enhancing the documentation. I’ve received a few suggestions on adding more in-depth examples and plan on doing that in the future. It would be good to show how to manipulate data, save to a database, and even do things like find the tallest player on a roster, etc. To @jcurrey’s point, I wouldn’t say this is completely within the bounds of `sportsreference`, but it would be great to show others a few ways that you can actually use the package to solve more complex problems.\r\n\r\nLastly, @jcurrey and @kbrahm, do either of you have further questions or suggestions? Are there any features I could/should add here outside of expanding the documentation? If so, I will create a new issue for those features and keep this one open for the documentation update.\r\n\r\nThanks again to
