@refekt, sorry for not getting to this sooner (been caught up with other projects). @soySmelliot is correct, `sportsreference` was able to retrieve a perfectly valid page for the upcoming season, but there wasn't any actual data on the page, preventing any information from being parsed and players being retrieved. As a result, you are unable to get any players for the current season at this time. Once the team at www.sports-reference.com adds information to the roster pages, you should be able to query it according to the example. Thanks for the great question!\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks @soySmelliot for the response as well! It's greatly appreciated!
