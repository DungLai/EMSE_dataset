@bpisaacoff, thanks for the suggestions! As you already gathered, those features are not presently included with the package, but I would be very happy to include them with a future release! My next non-patch release (0.5.0) is currently shaping up to add a bunch of features like these, so I think it makes sense to include them there. For easier tracking, I might split these core features into separate issues as it makes it easier on my side.\r\n\r\nThanks again!

@bpisaacoff, I realize my response here is nearly a year old at this point, but just wanted to follow-up that I added the NFL game info yesterday and will include it with the next release of

Additionally, I've been tracking the salary info for NFL, and I found that the sports-reference.com team doesn't really maintain player salaries anymore, and all links to the player salaries are broken. At this point, since the other main part of this issue is merged, I think I will go ahead and close this issue and mark it as complete. If you find that there is a good, reliable location on sports-reference.com which has player salary, I would be very happy to include that with the package!
