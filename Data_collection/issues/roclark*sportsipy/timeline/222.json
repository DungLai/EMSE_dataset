@Renaldas55, thanks for reaching out! I just did some digging here and found that sports-reference.com changed the table ID format for on the NBA boxscore pages for some older games (but strangely not all as you pointed out). The ID format went from `box_TEAM-game-basic` to `box-TEAM-game-basic` and the code here only catches the former. Luckily, if I check for both ID formats, this should resolve the issue which is a straightforward fix. I will create a patch shortly and get this working properly!\r\n\r\nThanks again for the issue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/538481057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2688084937,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY4ODA4NDkzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2688084937","actor":{"login":"Renaldas55","id":56148524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTQ4NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56148524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55","html_url":"https://github.com/Renaldas55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-04T17:04:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2688084939,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2ODgwODQ5Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2688084939","actor":{"login":"Renaldas55","id":56148524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTQ4NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56148524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55","html_url":"https://github.com/Renaldas55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renaldas55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-04T17:04:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2689023592,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY4OTAyMzU5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2689023592","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-05T01:59:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/538860302","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/222#issuecomment-538860302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/
