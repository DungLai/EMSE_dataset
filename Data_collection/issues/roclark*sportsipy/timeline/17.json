There’s a lot of valuable information that can be gained from individual player stats within each game (like the dominance of NPOY candidate Carsen Edwards). I’ve been waiting to include this until I finished both the `Boxscore` and `Player` classes, but now that both are complete, I think it would be wise to flag this as a higher priority.\r\n\r\nI think I agree with your first suggestion, it would be good to include it in the `Boxscore` class at the very least, but perhaps each player will have a sub-class instance within the Boxscore. I will do some more thinking on this, but I really like the idea and will include it with a future release. I’ve been meaning to get out version 0.3.0 with some other boxscore updates, but I will see if I can include this with that release, or prioritize it for the next one.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the suggestion and for the kind words! Always happy to see people finding the program useful and love getting suggestions to improve it!

one!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/446069003/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2017684118,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjAxNzY4NDExOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2017684118","actor":{"login":"j-andrews7","id":10225716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10225716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7","html_url":"https://github.com/j-andrews7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-11T04:32:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2017684119,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwMTc2ODQxMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2017684119","actor":{"login":"j-andrews7","id":10225716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10225716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7","html_url":"https://github.com/j-andrews7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-11T04:32:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2017684179,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyMDE3Njg0MTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2017684179","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-11T04:32:56Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https

just want to second the request - I was trying to easily get individual stats by game to do a comparison.\r\n\r\nNo FSU players finished the game today against UVA in double digits for points.

It looks like the best place to find it is through the game logs (https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/terance-mann-1/gamelog/2019/) or the box scores (https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2019-01-01-14-florida-state.html) - I don't know which would be easier to scrape, because the game logs would have to be done for each player, but OTOH, the box scores have to be done by game.  \r\n\r\nBTW - the answer is that this was the first time this season.

Just wanted to share that I've been working on this a bit more lately and finally have some code that I'm satisfied with. You can see my work in the [add-player-stats-to-boxscore](https://github.com/roclark/sportsreference/tree/add-player-stats-to-boxscore) branch if you want an early preview. As mentioned above, I created another class in the `boxscore` module, but I went a step further and created an abstract class in a different module which contains all of the duplicate properties between the two classes. That way, I figured I would reduce the amount of redundant code possible and make it easier to create future changes in a single place instead of having multiple copies that can get out-of-sync. Another priority of mine was to keep the method of calling the `Player` class in the `roster` module the same between the existing implementation and the new method to ensure any existing code that utilizes that class doesn't break.\r\n\r\nI won't merge this with master until I have finished doing something similar for all 5 of the other sports and add documentation, but the NCAAB code is working and I am not planning on changing it from its current state unless needed or requested.

So I'm curious, is there any particular game that you are having troubles with? I am able to get _most_ of the advanced stats (more on that later) from the new code. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscore\r\n\r\ngame = Boxscore('2019-01-23-19-ohio-state')\r\naway_team = game.away_players\r\nfor player in away_team:\r\n    print(player.name)\r\n    print('eFG:', player.effective_field_goal_percentage)\r\n    print('TS%:', player.true_shooting_percentage)\r\n    print('3PAr', player.three_point_attempt_rate)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this work on your end?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, I am pulling _most_ of the advanced stats. Currently, I'm missing both the offensive and defensive ratings. Since these weren't a part of the `Player` class, I didn't originally add them in, but I should do that now for completions sake (I'm having to do this for the other sports, so I will go back and add it here). Perhaps the fact that the offensive/defensive ratings weren't included threw things off?\r\n\r\nBTW, that's a fantastic article! Though I personally don't follow Louisville (Purdue grad myself and otherwise house-divided with KU and Michigan State grads), I always love seeing these articles and learning more about players on teams that I don't pay as close of attention to. And, of course, I love the fact that this package helped make that article possible! That's the whole reason I started this project, so I'm glad to know that this is being utilized. Thanks for the shout out at the end BTW. 😃\r\n\r\nLet me know if things aren't working for you and I will include the ratings in the meantime. I hope to make more progress on the other sports over the next few days and get a new release out.\r\n\r\nThanks as always!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/457384385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2095826826,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5NTgyNjgyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2095826826","actor":{"login":"j-andrews7","id":10225716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10225716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7","html_url":"https://github.com/j-andrews7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:35:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2095826827,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTU4MjY4Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2095826827","actor":{"login":"j-andrews7","id":10225716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10225716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7","html_url":"https://github.com/j-andrews7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:35:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/457387587","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/issues/17#issuecomment-457387587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/17","id":457387587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzM4NzU4Nw==","user":{"login":"j-andrews7","id":10225716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI1NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10225716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7","html_url":"https://github.com/j-andrews7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-andrews7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:46:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T22:46:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yeah,
