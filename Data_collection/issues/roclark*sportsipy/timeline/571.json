have encountered the same issue - home_wins being incorrect. \r\n\r\nthere are 2 defects. First, the default query has a defect, so all teams display 0. Away_wins works as expected. Second, when modified to to use the proper index into the item list, if the team is the 76ers, the findall will fail as it matches the 76 in the team name. \r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Python, but I took a go at trying to find a fix. I got it working, but not sure if this is proper Python code, and I'm not familiar with github. I'll try to clone and apply a fix and send in a pull request to share. in the mean time, this is what I did in case it helps someone. \r\n\r\nBTW, the code in this project is well written. \r\n\r\nto reproduce both defectss:\r\n```\r\nx1 = Boxscore(\"201810200PHI\").dataframe['home_wins']\r\nx2 = Boxscore(\"201810200POR\").dataframe['home_wins']\r\n```\r\n\r\nboxscore.py\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodify def home_wins to try\r\n             if \"76ers\" in self._home_record:\r\n                print (f\"found 76ers\")\r\n                name, wins, losses = re.findall(r'\\d+', self._home_record)\r\n            else:\r\n                wins, losses = re.findall(r'\\d+', self._home_record)                \r\n            return wins\r\n```\r\n\r\nin _parse_game_date I commented out the strip\r\n````\r\n            #if short_field == 'home_record':\r\n            #    strip = True`\r\n```\r\n\r\nin _parse_field\r\n ```\r\n   if field == \"home_record\":\r\n        index = 8\r\n        print (f\"home_record items index is: {index}, {items[index]}\")\r\n        \r\n    if field == \"away_record\":\r\n        index = 0\r\n        print (f\"away_record items index is: {index}, {items[index]}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use of index 0 looked wrong to me. the template looking for the table and <h2> matches 16 times on the page. the buttons for Q1, H1 and so on all match the same pattern. turns out our score is in the 8th position.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90881876/133742811-d5b2e3d3-c066-42dd-be62-26cd9a469399.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/921578407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DoubleBarrelBirds","id":90881876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODgxODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90881876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds","html_url":"https://github.com/DoubleBarrelBirds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoubleBarrelBirds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
