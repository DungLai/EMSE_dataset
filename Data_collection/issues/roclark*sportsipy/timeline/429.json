I didn't check your source code but I think it might be that it only checks when the games were scheduled and if it is in the past. And if so, it tries to get the boxscore. If the game did not happen, there is still a boxscore item, but it is completely empty, except for the date. So you might need a check, whether the game really happened or not before creating a boxscore item or before even creating the game in team.schedule\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48493592/83615153-7546db00-a586-11ea-97c5-a397b7825ed0.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/638052341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AnanasPizza","id":48493592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDkzNTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48493592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza","html_url":"https://github.com/AnanasPizza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnanasPizza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
