Looks like the `passing_yards` attribute was just in the `BoxscorePlayer` class but not a part of the `AbstractPlayer` class. Since both the `BoxscorePlayer` (part of the `boxscore` module) and `Player` (part of the `roster` module) classes inherit `AbstractPlayer`, any properties under the `AbstractPlayer` will be included in the two former classes. With `passing_yards` only under `BoxscorePlayer`, it was not showing up with `Player` objects when querying rosters, hence the missing attribute. I made a change already and am undergoing some final tests, but I will create a PR with the fix shortly. In the meantime, I can now run the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaaf.roster import Roster\r\n\r\nnebraska = Roster('Nebraska', year=2018)\r\n\r\nfor player in nebraska.players:\r\n    print(player.name, player.passing_yards)\r\n```\r\nwhich outputs...\r\n```\r\nAdrian Martinez 2617\r\nAndrew Bunch 320\r\nNoah Vedral 305\r\nMatt Masker None\r\nMaurice Washington 0\r\nDevine Ozigbo None\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again for reporting this and for your help in other issues, I greatly appreciate it! Also, as a fellow Big Ten fan, I wish your team all the best this coming season!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/522389521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2564881962,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU2NDg4MTk2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564881962","actor":{"login":"soySmelliot","id":17421205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDIxMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17421205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot","html_url":"https://github.com/soySmelliot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:33:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564881963,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NjQ4ODE5NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564881963","actor":{"login":"soySmelliot","id":17421205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDIxMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17421205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot","html_url":"https://github.com/soySmelliot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soySmelliot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:33:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2564882022,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNTY0ODgyMDIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2564882022","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:33:23Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/rocl
