@denutza, thanks for the issue! I actually just ran into this myself and created a small patch to resolve this issue. It looks like this is due to some player pages being invalid/missing/incomplete, especially for some of the earlier seasons, which causes the `ParserError` as there is no information to pull. I will create a PR and get the patch merged shortly so it can be resolved for my next release which should come relatively soon.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/609452390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3202758225,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIwMjc1ODIyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3202758225","actor":{"login":"denutza","id":14910352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTEwMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14910352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza","html_url":"https://github.com/denutza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-05T17:28:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3202758227,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMDI3NTgyMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3202758227","actor":{"login":"denutza","id":14910352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTEwMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14910352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza","html_url":"https://github.com/denutza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denutza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-05T17:28:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3202798278,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzIwMjc5ODI3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3202798278","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-05T18:06:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
