Thanks for informing me of this issue! Looks like the way that the team at sports-reference.com formats their boxscore pages is ever so slightly different this season, and the score now shows as an empty string instead of `None` as it previously did. I added an additional check in the `Boxscore` class to see if any of the scores are `None` or `''`, and if so, return `None` for the boxscore as it is invalid. This will only occur for games that haven't been played yet as there is no boxscore information to pull from them.\r\n\r\nI have a fix already created and will post a PR shortly. Thanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/529064469/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2615944090,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNTk0NDA5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2615944090","actor":{"login":"naymikm","id":10748305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ4MzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10748305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm","html_url":"https://github.com/naymikm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-07T02:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2615944091,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTU5NDQwOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2615944091","actor":{"login":"naymikm","id":10748305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ4MzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10748305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm","html_url":"https://github.com/naymikm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymikm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-07T02:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2615944107,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNjE1OTQ0MTA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2615944107","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-07T02:36:12Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://ap
