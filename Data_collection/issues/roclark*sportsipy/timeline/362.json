@AidanGlickman for the details! I just took a dive into the source for OBJ's stats page and found that the ID for the \"Receiving and Rushing\" table is `receiving`, which I was not parsing. Apparently, this same table has an ID of `rushing` for most players, but `receiving` for a handful of others. I tested adding `receiving` to the list of table IDs to pull, and it looks like the correct stats are being returned (143 career receptions) now. I will create and merge a patch shortly and will include this with my next patch release.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the report! I greatly appreciate the details!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/606370353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3181321669,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzE4MTMyMTY2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3181321669","actor":{"login":"AidanGlickman","id":21065540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDY1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21065540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman","html_url":"https://github.com/AidanGlickman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T03:02:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3181321671,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxODEzMjE2NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3181321671","actor":{"login":"AidanGlickman","id":21065540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDY1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21065540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman","html_url":"https://github.com/AidanGlickman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanGlickman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T03:02:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3182994969,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE4Mjk5NDk2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/3182994969","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-31T12:12:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
