You certainly made work a lot easier on my part. :smiley: I was planning on using one of my integer property decorators to handle the `weight` property to fix this, but you're right, the `.replace` function would still fail. Wrapping this in the `try...except` block works like a charm. Already have a fix that's working - just need to create a PR for it and move forwards.\r\n\r\nYou brought up a good point about git. I haven't made the branch names very clear for this repository, so it probably isn't intuitive how I setup the project for branch names. I will work on updating documentation to hopefully make it clearer. Also, I removed all of my locked branches for each release as the tags should be able to replicate the intended functionality.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback! PR incoming.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/comments/517819473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2530601042,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjUzMDYwMTA0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2530601042","actor":{"login":"rlindholm","id":24924804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTI0ODA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24924804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm","html_url":"https://github.com/rlindholm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T19:33:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2530601044,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1MzA2MDEwNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2530601044","actor":{"login":"rlindholm","id":24924804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTI0ODA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24924804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm","html_url":"https://github.com/rlindholm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlindholm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T19:33:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2530601160,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNTMwNjAxMTYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/events/2530601160","actor":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-02T19:33:20Z","assignee":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/u
