I think it has to do with broken links to player pages for players who appear on the given team's roster.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.roster import Roster, Player\r\nroster = Roster(team = 'houston', year = 2018, slim = False)\r\nroster = Roster(team = 'virginia-tech', year = 2018, slim = False)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nRosters to be returned like they are for the vast majority of NCAAB teams in most seasons.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51244947/58829369-84eeb500-85fc-11e9-8df0-7ec4ebc13201.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux (but running in Google Colab in browser, so this shouldn't matter)\r\n - Sportsreference Version 0.4.3\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAs mentioned above, this appears to be an issue with teams having players whose player pages have broken links. I looked at the 2 teams mentioned above and found these \"broken\" links to player pages (at least they appear broken to me):\r\n- for 2017-18 Houston, Fabian White Jr.: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/fabian-whitejr-1.html\r\n- for 2017-18 Virginia Tech, Wabissa Bede: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/wabissa-bede-1.html\r\n\r\nAppreciate if these can be fixed for these teams and others!","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
