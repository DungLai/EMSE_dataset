For example, the game between the Celtics and Cavaliers gives 47 points for the Celtics, as opposed to the 90 that they actually had, 60 minutes played as opposed to the 240 they actually played, etc etc. This is also true for every other home team in every game I can see, and for all of the other home team basic (not advanced) stats. In the code example below, 90 should be printed, but 47 is printed.\r\n\r\n**example**\r\nfrom sportsreference.nba.boxscore import Boxscore\r\nBoxscore('200810280BOS').home_points\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n- version of sportsreference API: 0.5.2 \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI believe it is likely that it's just pulling the wrong data from somewhere, would you be able to shed some light on this?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
