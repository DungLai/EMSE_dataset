the bug**\r\nSome players don't have a personal stats page created for them yet, but contain a valid link on roster pages, such as Moses Brown for the Portland Trail Blazers. As implemented, the Roster module for the NBA does not check if the returned data from the page is empty, and will attempt to parse information from an object which is `None`. Instead, if a player's page is invalid, the module should fail-fast and return `None` for the player instead of attempting to parse information or handle other scenarios.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nQuerying the Portland Trail Blazer's roster, especially Moses Brown's personal stats page, will throw an error.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nba.roster import Roster\r\n\r\nroster = Roster('POR')\r\nfor player in roster.players:\r\n    print(player.name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAny player which has an invalid page should have `None` returned for their information instead of throwing an error.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (affects all)\r\n - Sportsreference Version: 0.4.5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTraceback:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"tests/exhaustive/test_nba.py\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    for player in team.roster.players:\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/teams.py\", line 209, in roster\r\n    return Roster(self._abbreviation, self._year)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/roster.py\", line 1199, in __init__\r\n    self._find_players(year)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/roster.py\", line 1323, in _find_players\r\n    player_instance = Player(player_id)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/roster.py\", line 170, in __init__\r\n    player_data = self._pull_player_data()\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/roster.py\", line 487, in _pull_player_data\r\n    self._parse_player_information(player_info)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nba/roster.py\", line 348, in _parse_player_information\r\n    value = utils._parse_field(PLAYER_SCHEME, player_info, short_field)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/utils.py\", line 190, in _parse_field\r\n    items = [i.text() for i in html_data(scheme).items()]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
