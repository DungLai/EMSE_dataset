I see how to access a player's current contract via the method described in #2, but this appears to only let me access a players' current contract, and their past salaries. \r\n\r\nIs there any ability to access past data? Or if not, would it be possible to add this functionality? The data is available on the individual player pages ([e.g., here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html#all_salaries::none)), or the [team pages at the bottom.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/2005.html).\r\n\r\nThanks again!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
