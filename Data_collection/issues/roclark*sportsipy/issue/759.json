Following is the general documentation for the feature:\r\n\r\nReturns a \"list\" containing a list for each quarter's scores. Each score is represented by a \"dictionary\" that holds the following keys:\r\n* 'time' - Time on the clock until the end of the quarter.\r\n* 'team' - The scoring team's name.\r\n* 'details' - A summary of the scoring play, including players involved.\r\n* current_score' - A dictionary with the current score after the scoring play. It's keys are: 'home', 'away'.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n        [\r\n            [<1st-quarter-scores>], [<2nd-quarter-scores>], \r\n            [<3rd-quarter-scores>], [<4th-quarter-scores>],\r\n            [<overtime-scores>] \r\n        ]\r\n```\r\nExample for <1st-quarter-scores>:\r\n```   \r\n            [\r\n                {\r\n                    'time': '7:51',\r\n                    'team': 'Giants', \r\n                    'details': 'Lawrence Cager 9 yard pass from Daniel Jones Graham Gano kick)',\r\n                    'current_score': {'away': '0', 'home': '7'}\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
