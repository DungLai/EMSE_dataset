the bug**\r\nBoth the NCAAB and NCAAF `Boxscores` classes are missing fields that were intended to be included with the previous release, namely the winners and losers names and abbreviations.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscores as NCAAB\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaaf.boxscore import Boxscores as NCAAF\r\n\r\nb = NCAAB(datetime.today())\r\nprint(b.games)\r\nb = NCAAF(datetime.today())\r\nprint(b.games)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect the following fields, as indicated in the documentation, to be included as fields in the `games` property for both NCAAB and NCAAF: `winning_name`, `winning_abbr`, `losing_name`, `losing_abbr`.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please
