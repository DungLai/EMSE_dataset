is an outstanding issue with the `Boxscore` classes where game information for older seasons (generally 5+ years ago) is incorrectly parsed due to a lack of information displayed on the page. For example, [an NHL game from 2005](https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/200512130ATL.html) contains much less meta-information than [one from 2018](https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201810100ANA.html). The `Boxscore` class expects a certain number of rows to be located on the page. If an item is missing, the order can be thrown off and information can be put into the wrong categories, such as the game's date getting stored in the `attendance` property.","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
