For example, there is a slight difference in the page source between [Saturday 9/12](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/index.cgi?month=9&day=12&year=2020) and [Sunday 9/13](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/index.cgi?month=9&day=13&year=2020&conf_id=). The 9/13 page has an extra `tr` within the `div` to account for the date while the 9/12 does not have that extra table row. Otherwise, the main functionality works fine.
