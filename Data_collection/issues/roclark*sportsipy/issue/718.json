This has been a problem for both NBA box scores and MLB boxscores for me. I have used sportsipy before and never had this issue. I recently updated to Spyder 5.1.5 on my Mac and I have made sure that sportsipy is installed properly. I'm not sure if this is simply a user error on my end or something with the package itself. This is my first post on Github, and I'm not really sure if I've provided the correct information or context. If there is anymore info I can provide, I'm more than happy :)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"John8640","id":102270013,"node_id":"U_kgDOBhiEPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102270013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640","html_url":"https://github.com/John8640","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John8640/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
