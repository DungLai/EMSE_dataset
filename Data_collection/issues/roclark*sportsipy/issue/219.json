the bug**\r\nAny NFL team that has a game listed on sports-reference.com which hasn't been played yet will throw an error while attempting to iterate over the team's schedule. Since the boxscore page for the corresponding game either doesn't exist, or contains limited or incomplete data, the safest action would be to just return `None` for the requested game and allow execution to continue.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIterating over a team's schedule midway through the season will throw an error.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nfl.teams import Teams\r\n\r\nfor team in Teams():\r\n    for game in team.schedule:\r\n        print(game.dataframe_extended)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code should not attempt to pull boxscore information for any games that haven't occurred yet, and just return `None` for those games.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (affects all)\r\n - Sportsreference Version: 0.4.5\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTraceback:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"tests/exhaustive/test_nfl.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    print(game.dataframe_extended)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nfl/schedule.py\", line 213, in dataframe_extended\r\n    return self.boxscore.dataframe\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nfl/boxscore.py\", line 709, in dataframe\r\n    'losing_abbr': self.losing_abbr,\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nfl/boxscore.py\", line 835, in losing_abbr\r\n    if self.winner == HOME:\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/sportsreference/sportsreference/sportsreference/nfl/boxscore.py\", line 795, in winner\r\n    if self.home_points > self.away_points:\r\nTypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() > NoneType()\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
