the bug**\r\nSome roster pages for the upcoming season have empty rows in the roster tables, causing an error to be thrown as the code attempts to parse a player from nothing.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nAttempting to print the roster for the Grizzlies will throw an error:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.nba.roster import Roster\r\n\r\nfor player in Roster('MEM').players:\r\n    print(player.name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSince there is no player information in the presented row, I would expect the code would skip over the empty row and continue with execution.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (affects all)\r\n - Sportsreference Version: 0.4.5 (affects all)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAt the time of writing, the Memphis Grizzlies have an empty field: https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/2020.html\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File
