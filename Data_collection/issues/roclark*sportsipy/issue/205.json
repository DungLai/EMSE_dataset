A lot of current kickers follow the standard 8 character 'LlllFfNN' format.  But some have a 10 character string.  \r\n\r\nIn this example Mason Crosby this works fine and returns 'Field Goals - 30':  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nthisplayer = Player('CrosMa20') \r\ntheyear = '2018'\r\nprint('Field Goals -', thisplayer(theyear).field_goals_made)\r\n```\r\nBut for a player like Robbie Gould the page url is:\r\nhttps://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/gouldrob01.htm\r\n\r\nAnd this returns an error - 'TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable'\r\n```python\r\nthisplayer = Player('gouldrob01') \r\ntheyear = '2018'\r\nprint('Field Goals -', thisplayer(theyear).field_goals_made)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't quite identify why some kickers use this 10 character uri and the rest use the standard 8 character format.  Seems like the format changed over at some point a few years ago.  I'm not sure if this issue extends beyond place kickers.\r\n\r\nGreat work here!  This is a fantastic resource and it gives me an excuse to learn some Python.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
