the bug**\r\nThe home and away players in the MLB `Boxscore` class are being saved in the opposite property, causing home players to show under `away_players` and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample code which causes an issue.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.mlb.boxscore import Boxscore\r\n\r\nboxscore = Boxscore('BOS/BOS201806070')\r\n\r\nfor player in boxscore.home_players:\r\n    print(player.name)  # Prints the names of Tigers players, who were the away team\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe home team should show up under the `home_players` property, and away team should show up under `away_players`.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (affects all)\r\n - Sportsreference
