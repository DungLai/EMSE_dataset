The error messages seem to indicate the error appears to have to do with missing game time for a single game on each of the team's schedule.\r\n\r\nFor all teams I've tried prior to the 2014-15 season, it seems that the dataframe associated with the Schedule object won't load. This shows a different error but also seems related to missing data, it seems, as no teams in those earlier seasons have times on their schedules (it appears to be something that Sports Reference only has going back a few years). In this case, it does seem that you can access sched.dataframe_extended for those teams, which has different columns than sched.dataframe, which makes me think this has to do with some exception handling around missing data as well.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nsched = Schedule(abbreviation = 'cleveland-state', year = 2015)\r\nsched_df = sched.dataframe\r\nsched_df\r\n\r\nsched = Schedule(abbreviation = 'savannah-state', year = 2015)\r\nsched_df = sched.dataframe\r\nsched_df\r\n\r\nsched = Schedule(abbreviation = 'kentucky', year = 2014)\r\nsched_df = sched.dataframe\r\nsched_df\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe schedule data frame to be accessible for these teams like it is for the vast majority of NCAAB teams in 2014-15 and forward.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51244947/58831264-2b3cb980-8601-11e9-85b0-472a4f172340.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux (but running in Google Colab in browser, so this shouldn't matter)\r\n - Sportsreference Version 0.4.3\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- 2014-15 Cleveland State schedule: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/cleveland-state/2015-schedule.html (missing time for Game 10)\r\n- 2014-15 Savannah State schedule: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/savannah-state/2015-schedule.html (missing time for Game 8)\r\n- 2013-14 Kentucky schedule: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/kentucky/2014-schedule.html (no time column)","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
