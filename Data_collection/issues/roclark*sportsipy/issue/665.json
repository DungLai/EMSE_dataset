The expected behavior is demonstrated in the \"F\" int values, as the \"goals_for\" property is working as expected, unlike the \"A\" and \"Avg\" values.\r\n\r\n> NSH F:261 A:None Avg:None\r\n> TBL F:290 A:None Avg:None\r\n> ...(truncated)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - OS: Chromebook \r\n - Jupyter Notebook running in chrome browser launched from Linux:\r\n - Linux penguin 5.4.131-16049-gc688e114d34e #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Sep 9 20:21:35 PDT 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n - Sportsipy Version: 1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis occurs across all seasons and all teams.
