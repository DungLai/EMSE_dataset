Please describe.**\r\nMany of the saved test files are very out of date at this point, and are as much as 3 years old. The website has changed a fair amount over the years and plenty of new features have been added. To capture these latest features, the default test files should be updated with newer content, which would also require updating the pre-defined values in the test files.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe files in all of the various folders should be changed with a pull from current data. For example, the [current MLB Boxscore test file](https://github.com/roclark/sportsreference/blob/master/tests/integration/boxscore/mlb/BOS201806070.shtml) should be replaced with a newer version of a game that took place this season. The [pre-defined results data](https://github.com/roclark/sportsreference/blob/master/tests/integration/boxscore/test_mlb_boxscore.py#L48) should be updated with the new stats in order to pass the tests.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe data could still work as-is with the old data, but it doesn't offer the best opportunity to continually push and expand the package as the website progresses.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis can be done over multiple PRs (ie. one per sport, or one per module), or in a single shot. Regardless of the number, the layout of the commits and PRs should look very similar to one-another.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
