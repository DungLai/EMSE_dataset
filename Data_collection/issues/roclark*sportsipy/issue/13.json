the bug**\r\nRegardless of the year, the NCAAB rankings always show up as empty. No errors are thrown, but something is clearly wrong.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.rankings import Rankings\r\n\r\nfor year in range(2000, 2019):\r\n    rankings = Rankings(str(year))\r\n    print(rankings.complete)\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n{0: []}\r\n{0: []}\r\n...\r\n{0: []}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the above code to return rankings that follow the format listed in the documentation, such as:\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    week number, ie 19 (int): [\r\n        {\r\n            'abbreviation': Team's abbreviation, such as 'PURDUE'\r\n                            (str),\r\n            'name': Team's full name, such as 'Purdue' (str),\r\n            'rank': Team's rank for the current week (int),\r\n            'week': Week number for the results, such as 19 (int),\r\n            'date': Date the rankings were released, such as\r\n                    '2017-03-01'. Can also be 'Final' for the final\r\n                    rankings or 'Preseason' for preseason rankings\r\n                    (str),\r\n            'previous': The team's previous rank, if applicable\r\n                        (str),\r\n            'change': The amount the team moved up or down the\r\n                      rankings. Moves up the ladder have a positive\r\n                      number while drops yield a negative number\r\n                      and teams that didn't move have 0 (int)\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n - Sportsreference Version: 0.2.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt appears sports-reference.com changed the layout of the standard rankings page which is not compatible with the `Rankings` class. The old version is still saved on the site with a URL along the line of `https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/2019-polls-old.html`. The old page should be used if possible to reduce the amount of code refactoring.","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
