Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, for any applications to pull a specific team from any of the original six supported sports (MLB, NBA, NCAAB, NCAAF, NFL, and NHL), it is required to first go through the `sportsreference.*.teams.Teams` class, followed by selecting a given team from the returned instance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.teams import Teams\r\n\r\nteams = Teams()\r\npurdue = teams('Purdue')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is the most efficient way to retrieve a list of all teams, it would be much easier on end-users to instead pull a specific team directly using the `Team` class. This would also be a more intuitive way of using the modules as new users would likely first see the `Team` class and want to pull a specific team instead of thinking of pulling all teams and selecting one.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdding another parameter to the `Team` class for the original six sports indicating the team to pull and parsing that specific team if not called through `Teams`. This is similar to the newly added football section, and could look along these lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.teams import Team\r\n\r\npurdue = Team('Purdue')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, the `purdue` instance above would be functionally identical to the first example.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUnfortunately, this won't save much wall time as the same number of requests to sports-reference.com will be made, but some computational complexity will be reduced as only a single team will need to be instantiated instead of all teams in a given league.\r\n\r\n**Progress**\r\n\r\n- [x] MLB\r\n- [x] NBA\r\n- [x] NCAAB\r\n- [x] NCAAF\r\n- [x] NFL\r\n- [x] NHL","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
