I think it's similar to #167, #169 and #202, but the resolution is insufficient.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsipy.nba.roster import Player\r\np = Player('quetane01')\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI think it will be correct to add a dependency for pycountry. In addition, please add a kind of behavior if country not found, to avoid an exception. 4ex, I believe that result for Chris Duarte(\"duartch01\") is incorrect in the source (\"dr\" instead of \"do\"), and it will be well to have a possibility to work in such case.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
