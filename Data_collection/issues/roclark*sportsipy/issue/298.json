the bug**\r\nWhen sportsreference has no weight for a player (for example: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kenny-maccalla-1.html) the player.dataframe call fails. This is because the code assumes the `self._weight` variable will be a string, but it can be `None`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.roster import Player\r\nplayer = Player('kenny-maccalla-1')\r\nprint(player.name)\r\nprint(player.weight)\r\nprint(player.dataframe)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIn the code above, I expected player.weight to return an empty string, None, or a placeholder value like `0`. Additionally I expected player.dataframe to return a dataframe with the players stats, including an empty string, None, or a placeholder value like `0` for the weight column.\r\n\r\nThis might not be elegant enough for you but you could simply do something like the following:\r\n```\r\n    @property\r\n    def weight(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Returns an ``int`` of the player's weight in pounds.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._weight is not None:\r\n            return int(self._weight.replace('lb', ''))\r\n        else:\r\n            return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: 10.14.6\r\n - Sportsreference Version 0.4.7\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis seems to only affect the package when calling roster dataframes for older seasons, since recent seasons have weights for all/most players. This might be affecting additional variables, too.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
