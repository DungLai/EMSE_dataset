If there was a field that I could grab from the professional NFL player data that gave their college for a given year (FR or SR) or possibly their college player_id that could help. Having the player_id be different for both college and NFL I know is probably necessary but I need to match this data somehow.\r\n\r\nI guess this might be useful in the other direction as well. Given player data in college a way to find their player_id in NFL or which team they were drafted to in the nfl would be useful.\r\n\r\nOf course if there is a trick to get around this I would be very grateful to hear about it.
