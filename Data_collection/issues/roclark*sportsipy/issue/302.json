your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe NBA Boxscores class should include a property which exposes the games final scoring summary. This will give end-users the ability to see how many points each team scored in every quarter.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne possible solution would be to create a dictionary with the scoring summary and differentiate between both teams, similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscoring_summary = {\r\n    'away': [22, 23, 27, 21],\r\n    'home': [25, 33, 29, 26]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the case of overtime, additional elements can be added as necessary to the scoring summary.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA couple other options would be to create separate properties for the home and away teams, but the scoring summary is generally presented together and feels like a more logical coupling.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to extend the dictionary with further granularity similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscoring_summary = {\r\n    'away': {\r\n        'first': 22,\r\n        'second': 23,\r\n        'third': 27,\r\n        'fourth': 21\r\n    },\r\n    'home': {\r\n        'first': 25,\r\n        'second': 33,\r\n        'third': 29,\r\n        'fourth': 26\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis method doesn't feel elegant and the verbosity of the keys isn't entirely necessary. Plus, this becomes more difficult to utilize in scripts at the risk of clarity.","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
