the bug**\r\nI'm getting a xml parsing error when I loop through the Rosters for 2019, but not any other year.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample code which causes an issue.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.roster import Roster\r\n\r\nbama = Roster('ALABAMA')\r\nfor player in bama.players:\r\n    # Prints the name of all players who played for Alabama in the most\r\n    # recent season.\r\n    print(player.name)\r\n    \r\nprint(\"At least we've got football\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPrint the players name.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Sportsreference Version 0.3.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm really wondering if this is just on my setup or if Sports Reference is doing something different on their site.  Here's the link:  https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/alabama/2019.html \r\n\r\nThis happens to me on the sample code too, the Bama fan in me change just changed the team :)\r\nThis really is an incredible project!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
