your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe College Football Playoff rankings should be included as another ranking which can be pulled from the `ncaaf.rankings` module once they become available each season. These rankings should function similarly to the AP poll rankings which are already available.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe rankings should be incorporated with the `ncaaf.rankings` module and be requested and structured similarly to how the AP rankings are currently handled. To differentiate between CFP and AP rankings, an additional parameter can be added to the `Rankings` class to allow users to specify which poll to use.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother method of pulling the CFP is to automatically retrieve both the AP and CFP rankings and allow users to choose the poll once finished, but this isn't as elegant of a solution as it would take longer for a potentially unnecessary reason as users might not want both rankings.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nA link to the 2018 CFP rankings can be found [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2018-polls.html#all_cfbplayoff).\r\n\r\n**NOTICE ON CREDIT: This idea was brought to me privately by a community member and I do not take credit for this great idea.**","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
