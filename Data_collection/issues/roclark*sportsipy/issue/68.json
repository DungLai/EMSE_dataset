the bug**\r\nA type error is thrown when grabbing NCAAB stats from Teams when the stat is a difference between two stats like defensive_rebounds, opp_defensive_rebounds, and net_rating. I believe the issue is that one of the two (or both of the values) are missing. When the value is missing (i.e. the stat is not listed on sports-reference.com), the value is set to None and the type error occurs.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample code which causes an issue.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.teams import Teams\r\nteams=Teams(2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe code above works for more recent years but years after 2009 (I believe) some of the data is not available from sports-reference.com which is what is causing the error.\r\n\r\n**A Possible Fix**\r\nAn example of a possible fix is shown below. The defensive_rebounds, opp_defensive_rebounds, and net_rating definitions in teams.py file in ncaab need to be modified to try to perform the calculation first. In the event that it fails, set the value to None.\r\n```python\r\ndef defensive_rebounds(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Returns an ``int`` of the total number of defensive rebounds during the\r\n        season.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        try:\r\n            out=self.total_rebounds - self.offensive_rebounds\r\n        except:\r\n            out=None\r\n        return out\r\n````\r\nA similar try/except will need to be performed for opp_defensive_rebounds, and net_rating as well.","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
