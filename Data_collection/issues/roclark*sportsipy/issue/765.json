I used .name using the proper teams abbreviations such as 'KAN'. For KAN it successfully returned Kansas City Chiefs, and for DEN it successfully returned Denver Broncos. \r\n\r\nThat being said, when I used 'LAC' and 'LVR' for the Chargers and Raiders, I was presented with the same essential error for each - KeyError: 'LAC'  for the chargers and KeyError: 'LVR' for the Raiders \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n`from sportsipy.nfl.teams import Team\r\n\r\nteamName1 = Team('KAN')\r\nprint(teamName1.name)\r\n\r\nteamName2 = Team('DEN')\r\nprint(teamName2.name)\r\n\r\nteamName3 = Team('LVR')\r\nprint(teamName3.name)\r\n\r\nteamName4 = Team('LAC')\r\nprint(teamName4.name)`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor LAC I was expecting Los Angeles Chargers to be returned.\r\nFor LVR I was expecting Las Vegas Raiders to be returned. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots and Links**\r\nLink showing all the abbreviations uses by sports-reference.

It seems to be that the abbreviation needed is not the one listed on their website or any other website for that matter. That being said I know JAX works and returns Jacksonville Jaguars.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
