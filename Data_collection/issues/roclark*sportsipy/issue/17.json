your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI'm sure you've considered this, but being able to get individual player stats for a given game would be wonderful. Particularly for the NCAA basketball module, though I'm sure all of them could use it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd guess that it'd be easiest to do this within the BoxScore class, but I suppose you could also do it by passing in the boxscore URI to a Player object similar to how you do it by season now. Just by glancing at the code for it, it seems like the former would be easier than the latter, though perhaps not as elegant.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've looked just about everywhere for free NCAAB player data, and I'm pretty sure the only real solution right now is to scrape. Which while not necessarily difficult, is annoying given how often most stats sites change. This is by far the most complete API with any sort of wrapper that I've seen, so I really appreciate what you've done already. Even if you are a Carsen Edwards fan ;)\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to hear if this is in your plans at all.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/17/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
