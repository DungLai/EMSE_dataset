the bug**\r\nThe latest version of `sportsreference` (0.3.0) throws an error when pulling boxscores that don't have a score associated with it yet. The stack trace looks like the following:\r\n```python\r\n  File \"t.py\", line 4, in <module>\r\n    b = Boxscores(datetime.today())\r\n  File \"/home/roclark/sportsreference/sportsreference/ncaab/boxscore.py\", line 1212, in __init__\r\n    self._find_games(date, end_date)\r\n  File \"/home/roclark/sportsreference/sportsreference/ncaab/boxscore.py\", line 1546, in _find_games\r\n    boxscores = self._extract_game_info(games)\r\n  File \"/home/roclark/sportsreference/sportsreference/ncaab/boxscore.py\", line 1493, in _extract_game_info\r\n    names = self._get_team_names(game)\r\n  File \"/home/roclark/sportsreference/sportsreference/ncaab/boxscore.py\", line 1458, in _get_team_names\r\n    away_score = self._get_score(scores[0])\r\nIndexError: list index out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA call to the `Boxscores` class for any date that is not in the past (ie. today or a future date) will throw the error.\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom sportsreference.ncaab.boxscore import Boxscores\r\n\r\nb = Boxscores(datetime.today())\r\nprint(b.games)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe boxscore should still be parsed, but the winner, loser, and score should all be `None` in this case. Just because a score can't be associated with the game, doesn't mean an error should be thrown as there is currently no other way to query future games using `sportsreference` outside of pulling the team's schedule.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n - Sportsreference Version: 0.3.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
