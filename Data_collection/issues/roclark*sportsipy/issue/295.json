Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nWhen querying a boxscore player's stats, it returns an integer representing the number of innings a pitcher has pitched in. However, since a pitcher can pitch a fraction of an inning, returning an integer makes the data incomplete. When a pitcher pitches a fraction of an inning, no innings pitched are listed. I need to know exactly how many innings each pitcher pitches in each appearance, and that does not seem to be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nList the pitcher's innings in terms of a float, with the fraction, so that the data is accurate. Preferably with (for example) 4.1 meaning the pitcher pitched 4 1/3 innings and 6.2 meaning 6 2/3 innings.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\nScraping baseball-reference player gamelogs or game pages myself, though I prefer to use the sports-reference package.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
