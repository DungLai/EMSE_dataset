I recently updated to Spyder 5.1.5 on my Mac (OS Monterey 12.1) and I have the latest version of sportsipy installed. I'm not sure if this is simply a user error on my end or something with the package itself. This is my first post on Github, and I'm not really sure if I've provided the correct information or context. If there is anymore info I can provide, I'm more than happy :)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
