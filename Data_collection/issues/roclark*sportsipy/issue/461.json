Rather, it returns a dictionary, and in it there are only yesterdays games. This is presumably because today's games have not yet been updated with the results, however if you try to run 'Boxscores(tomorrow, tomorrow + 7 days), you just get a dictionary with the next 7 days as keys, but in every entry you get the same list of yesterdays games. This should return at least the index of the future games. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample code which causes an issue.\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom sportsreference.mlb.boxscore import Boxscore, Boxscores\r\n\r\ngames = Boxscores(datetime(2020, 9, 1), datetime(2020, 9, 8))\r\nprint(games.games)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the above code to return a dictionary with each future date as keys (which it does), and in each of these entries, have a list of the game data for the future (which is does not). \r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
