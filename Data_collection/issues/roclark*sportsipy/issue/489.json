Please describe.**\r\nThe examples and tutorials sections on the README and in the [docs](https://github.com/roclark/sportsreference/blob/master/docs/examples.rst) are fairly dated at this point, and can be augmented with more information and new examples of advanced analysis you can perform with `sportsreference`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAt the very least, using more modern years for the samples in both locations would be very helpful to stay current. Adding new examples would be great in the docs as well so users can get more ideas of what to do with the package.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother idea (which could also be done) is to have a doc full of real projects where people use `sportsreference` as one of the core requirements. This would help promote the package, while also promoting that person's work.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
