your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the `Boxscores` classes are intended to be forward-looking in the sense that they don't check or save the results of completed games. Being able to show scores and the winners would allow many opportunities to handle the information in unique ways and can be considered a critical feature.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe `Boxscores` class for all 6 sports currently supported in `sportsreference` should include properties to indicate scores and winners for every game that has completed.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs the `Boxscore` class already has this information, and using `Boxscores` is the best way to query multiple games, the functionality is most clearly missing from `Boxscores` and should be placed there.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe following properties should be added to the `Boxscores` classes:\r\n  * `winning_name`: Full name of the winning team\r\n  * `winning_abbr`: Abbreviation of the winning team\r\n  * `losing_name`: Full name of the losing team\r\n  * `losing_abbr`: Abbreviation of the losing team\r\n  * `home_score`: Integer score for the home team\r\n  * `away_score`: Integer score for the away team","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
