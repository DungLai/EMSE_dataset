Is that possible? When I use the Boxscore module in sportsreference.ncaab.boxscore, it returns team-level box score information, which is wonderful, but I don't see a way to get the same data on a player-level (e.g., Carsen Edwards took 10 FGA, etc...).\r\n\r\nIs that sort of data available through this package?
