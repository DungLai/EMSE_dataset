Please describe.**\r\nThe Teams interface can be a bit a clunky when you're learning to use the module. For instance, running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sportsreference.mlb.teams import Teams\r\nteams = Teams(2017)\r\nprint(teams)\r\n```\r\nbombs at the printing statement:\r\nTypeError: __str__ returned non-string (type list)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if running the following code:\r\n```\r\nmy_team = teams(\"HOU\")\r\nprint(my_team)\r\n```\r\nthen I can see that I have a Team object. However, if I go after the schedule with:\r\n```\r\nmy_team.schedule\r\n```\r\nthen I get another type error.  I can get what I want by specifying that I want the dataframe attribute, but this is not intuitive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhou_schedule = my_team.schedule\r\ndf1 = hou_schedule.dataframe\r\nprint(df1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nteams = Teams(2017)\r\n```\r\nI think onr should be able to\r\n*  print this out and see what type of object it is\r\n* have access to a .show_all() function that lists all of the abreviations\r\n* have positional access to teams, so that teams[1] might be Houston, or some other mechanism that makes it easy to get an arbitrary team.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe first section describes a workaround. The package is working great. The interfaces could use some work.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roclark","id":12703406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzAzNDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12703406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark","html_url":"https://github.com/roclark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roclark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
