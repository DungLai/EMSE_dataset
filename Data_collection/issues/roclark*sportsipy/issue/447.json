The problem really just arises when trying to pull the full list of NCAAB teams that season (so is likely a problem with Teams()). This may end up being a problem with the sports-reference website itself, but I just wanted to draw attention to the issue.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
