I'm searching for players' pitching stats for a year, and it is instead returning their career numbers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSample code which causes an issue.\r\n```python\r\nfrom sportsreference.mlb.roster import Roster, Player\r\n\r\nbraves = Roster('ATL', '1995')\r\npitchers = [player for player in braves.players if player.position == 'P']\r\nsummary_list = []\r\n\r\nfor pitcher in pitchers:\r\n  summary_list.append(pitcher.name, pitcher.era, pitcher.whip)\r\n\r\nprint(summary_list)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nStats for the year 1995 are returned. Instead, career stats are returned.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\nMac\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roclark/sportsipy/issues/449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
