The first 6 feature maps are produced by downsampling with MaxPool of stride 2 in ceil mode or conv3x3 with stride 2 and 1x1 padding, so their strides are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and we only use feature maps of shape 38x38, 19x19, 10x10 and 5x5. The last 2 features maps are produced by conv3x3 with stride 1 and no padding. It is different from the former so we can't say that the strides are 128 and 256. Finally, the strides would be 300/3=100 and 300/1=300.
