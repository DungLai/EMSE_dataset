All you need to do is following,\r\n1. Create your cutomDataset folder in `ssd/data/datasets/evaluation`\r\n2. Copy and paste [__init__.py] (https://github.com/lufficc/SSD/blob/master/ssd/data/datasets/evaluation/voc/__init__.py) to evaluate on VOC dataset.\r\n3. Next, rename function definition. Now arrange your GT and predictions similart to `__init__.py` file. \r\n4. Only important part is to read your ground truth from dataloader and customize `get_annotation()` function in your dataloader. https://github.com/lufficc/SSD/blob/50373c79b861d5d239be4206fafc6661cea040b4/ssd/data/datasets/evaluation/voc/__init__.py#L21 \r\nYour ground truth should be xyxy format and it should be with respect to your input image size.\r\n5. You might also return image H,W in 4th step. It will be used to resize prediction boxes to your image size.\r\n6. Pass these values to `eval_detection_voc()` function. \r\nhttps://github.com/lufficc/SSD/blob/50373c79b861d5d239be4206fafc6661cea040b4/ssd/data/datasets/evaluation/voc/__init__.py#L35","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/comments/700975969/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"priteshgohil","id":43172056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTcyMDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43172056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshgohil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3821604935,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgyMTYwNDkzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3821604935","actor":{"login":"ShiqiSong","id":50983620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50983620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong","html_url":"https://github.com/ShiqiSong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-29T20:44:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3821604938,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MjE2MDQ5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3821604938","actor":{"login":"ShiqiSong","id":50983620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50983620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong","html_url":"https://github.com/ShiqiSong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiqiSong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-29T20:44:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3995135460,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk5NTEzNTQ2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3995135460","actor":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-13T19:51:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
