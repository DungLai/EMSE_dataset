the `WarmupMultiStepLR` code as follow (or other methods):\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     def get_lr(self):\r\n>         if self.last_epoch <= self.warmup_iters:\r\n>             alpha = self.last_epoch / self.warmup_iters\r\n>             warmup_factor = self.warmup_factor * (1 - alpha) + alpha\r\n>             return [lr * warmup_factor for lr in self.base_lrs]\r\n>         else:\r\n>             lr = super().get_lr()\r\n>         return lr\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n     Thanks for your methods to avoid zero LR. But I get nan loss in training process.
