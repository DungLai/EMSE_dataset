Pytorch version is 1.1. Others are same as your envs.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is caused by data loader. COCO datasets is much larger than VOC. It will cost most of time to load data if you only use 1 data loading worker. You can count the running time of loading data and training separately to check if it is caused by data loading worker. If so, more number of data loading workers is recommended.
