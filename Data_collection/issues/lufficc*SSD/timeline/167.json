In your dataset, boxes values are absolute value. But when compute loss, these values are normalized to 0-1(This is done by ToPercentCoords() transform).\r\n\r\nNegative values occur because of a wrong implementation of `RandomMirror()`. The reason is the mixup of height and width. You can reproduce the behavior by testing the augmentation with `imgaug.augmenters.Fliplr()` and `imgaug.augmentables.bbs.BoundingBoxesOnImage`. Latter takes the same x1,y1,x2,y2 bbox format as well as the image shape (H,W,[C]) as input. If you mix up  height and width you'll get (wrong) negative values which are identical to the ones calculated by `RandomMirror()`. You can verify the results by displaying the image with its labels (e.g. use `pycocotools`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/comments/717795487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Shakesbeer333","id":50136885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTM2ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50136885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333","html_url":"https://github.com/Shakesbeer333","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakesbeer333/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3930097607,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkzMDA5NzYwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3930097607","actor":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T09:03:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3930097617,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MzAwOTc2MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3930097617","actor":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T09:03:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3930097621,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkzMDA5NzYyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3930097621","actor":{"login":"priteshgohil","id":43172056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTcyMDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43172056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshgohil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshgohil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-28T09:03:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3930097628,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MzAwOTc2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/events/3930097628","actor":{"login":"priteshgohil","id":431
