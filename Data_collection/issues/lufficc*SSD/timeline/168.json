However, after let say 2000 iteration, training error is constant and not reducing at all. \r\n\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43172056/93709092-d695b880-fb3b-11ea-8597-c7d5892acf2f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried training at different learning rate but nothing helped.\r\n\r\nThe same custom dataset is trained using yolo and training is perfect. Also I have verified each stage in the data loader where its loaded properly.
