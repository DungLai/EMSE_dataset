Batch Size should decide by GPU-memory ( I run the program on 8*Tesla v100  32G memory, I think it is enougt for training ), why it cause such an error in loss function,\r\n**2.** \r\nI  think batch size should be related to the iteration step,  but the iteration is independent to batch size, so the small batch size will lead to shorter trainning time\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions about the 2 questions ? \r\nThks a lot","closed_by":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
