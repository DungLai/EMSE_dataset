In that case, how should I deal with [assign_priors()](https://github.com/lufficc/SSD/blob/50373c79b861d5d239be4206fafc6661cea040b4/ssd/utils/box_utils.py#L74) function? \r\n\r\nNormally it throws the following error because of zero gt_boxes.\r\n```\r\nOriginal Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch-ssd-lfc/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/worker.py\", line 185, in _worker_loop\r\n    data = fetcher.fetch(index)\r\n  File \"/home/user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch-ssd-lfc/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/fetch.py\", line 44, in fetch\r\n    data = [self.dataset[idx] for idx in possibly_batched_index]\r\n  File \"/home/user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch-ssd-lfc/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/utils/data/_utils/fetch.py\", line 44, in <listcomp>\r\n    data = [self.dataset[idx] for idx in possibly_batched_index]\r\n  File \"/home/user/code/ssd-lufficc/ssd/data/datasets/bdd.py\", line 123, in __getitem__\r\n    boxes, category = self.target_transform(boxes, category)\r\n  File \"/home/user/code/ssd-lufficc/ssd/data/transforms/target_transform.py\", line 22, in __call__\r\n    self.corner_form_priors, self.iou_threshold)\r\n  File \"/home/user/code/ssd-lufficc/ssd/utils/box_utils.py\", line 94, in assign_priors\r\n    ious = iou_of(gt_boxes.unsqueeze(0), corner_form_priors.unsqueeze(1))\r\n  File \"/home/user/code/ssd-lufficc/ssd/utils/box_utils.py\", line 65, in iou_of\r\n    overlap_left_top = torch.max(boxes0[..., :2], boxes1[..., :2])\r\nRuntimeError: The size of tensor a (0) must match the size of tensor b (2) at non-singleton dimension 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem,  I return corner_from_priors and labels (all zeros)  whenever gt_boxes are zero, as seen below.\r\n```\r\ndef assign_priors(gt_boxes, gt_labels, corner_form_priors, iou_threshold):\r\n    if (gt_boxes.shape[0]==0):\r\n        return corner_form_priors, torch.zeros(corner_form_priors.max(1)[0].shape).type(torch.LongTensor)\r\n    else:\r\n        # size: num_priors x num_targets eg. torch.Size([8732, 7])\r\n        ious = iou_of(gt_boxes.unsqueeze(0), corner_form_priors.unsqueeze(1))\r\n    ......\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this correct?
