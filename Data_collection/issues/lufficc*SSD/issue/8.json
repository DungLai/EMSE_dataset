Also, i hear some other projects can achive 0.3/iteration in pytorch.\r\nCan you share your training speed?","closed_by":{"login":"LovPe","id":11580882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTgwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11580882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe","html_url":"https://github.com/LovPe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LovPe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
