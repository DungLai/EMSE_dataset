To convert I used the following code:\r\n\r\nfrom ssd.config import cfg\r\nfrom ssd.modeling.detector import build_detection_model\r\nimport torch \r\ncfg.merge_from_file('configs/vgg_custom_ssd512.yaml')\r\nmodel = build_detection_model(cfg)\r\nstate_dict = torch.load('model_final.pth', map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)['model']\r\nmodel.load_state_dict(state_dict)\r\ndummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 512, 512, device='cpu')\r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, 'ssdpytorch.onnx', verbose = True)\r\n\r\nI got the following error:\r\n`RuntimeError: Only tuples, lists and Variables supported as JIT inputs, but got Container`\r\n\r\nThough Container isn't used either in model or in state_dict, this data type is used while converting model to ONNX. From your point of view, is it solvable? Exactly the same error with vgg_ssd512_voc0712, so this error is easily reproducible.","closed_by":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
