Both of their annotations are filtered to keep 'person' as the only remained category (aim to train a person detector). While using no matter which of these two datasets as the only data source, things went well and losses converged easily. Yet when I combined them with torch.utils.data.ConcatDataset as you did in SSD/ssd/data/datasets/__init__.py, the loss begins to vibrate for some reason that I can't figure out. Do you have any idea about this phenomenon? Thanks in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
