I also trained a Faster-RCNN and even with a resnext-152 as backbone I have similar/faster inference time.","closed_by":{"login":"YellowKyu","id":6276047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzYwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6276047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu","html_url":"https://github.com/YellowKyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YellowKyu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
