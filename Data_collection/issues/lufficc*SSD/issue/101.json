Then, suddenly, the regression loss goes to infinity. It recovers for several more iterations, but then it goes to inf again. This keeps happening repeatedly till the regression loss is inf still.\r\n\r\nI have tried following, but it didn't help:\r\n- Verifying dataset images and bbox/labels completenes - no NaN, Inf, or incorrect size has occurred.\r\n- Set learning rate from 1e-3 to 1e-4 - fails only about 20 iterations later with much higher regression loss before it goes to inf.\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas what could be the problem?\r\n\r\nOne more note, that might help: Some of the bboxes have intersection or are subset of another.\r\n\r\nADD: Decreasing WarmUp factor 10 times did not help as well.\r\n\r\nI also would like to thank you for this code, it is very nicely written and easily extendable.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"krysma","id":37614230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjE0MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37614230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma","html_url":"https://github.com/krysma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krysma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
