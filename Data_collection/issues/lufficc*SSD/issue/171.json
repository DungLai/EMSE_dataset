Thank you for your work!\r\n\r\nI wanted to enhance the result so I'm trying to add CoordConv on ssd.\r\n\r\nI added CoordConv in class SSDDetector() like follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef forward(self, images, targets=None):\r\n    images = self.coordConv(images)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt worked well and I also tried to add CoordConv right after backbone, before box_head like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef forward(self, images, targets=None):\r\n    images = self.coordConv(images)\r\n    features = self.backbone(images)\r\n    # for i, feature in enumerate(features):\r\n    #     if feature.shape[1] == 256:\r\n    #         features[i] = self.coordConv256(feature)\r\n    #     elif feature.shape[1] == 512:\r\n    #         features[i] = self.coordConv512(feature)\r\n    #     elif feature.shape[1] == 1024:\r\n    #         features[i] = self.coordConv1024(feature)\r\n    detections, detector_losses = self.box_head(features, targets)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the training results were nan.\r\n\r\nIs it a weird idea to add CoordConv right after backbone?\r\n\r\nWhat position do you recommend to add CoordConv in ssd?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance :P","closed_by":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
