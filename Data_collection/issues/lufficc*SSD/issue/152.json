You'd normally do this by just replacing the last fully connected layer with a dense net of the correct size, like in this tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html\r\n\r\nWhat the smart way to do this with your code base be, with say your pretrained vgg_ssd512_coco_trainval35k model?
