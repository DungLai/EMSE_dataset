But, by the schedular, the learning rate would decrease very rapidly (1e-26). \r\nSo please be careful when you use the newest pytorch. For the correct training, you need to install pytorch==1.0.1!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-18 15-32-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23020556/57965771-79a45400-7983-11e9-8319-35cb4308c823.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lufficc","id":20706332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA2MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20706332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc","html_url":"https://github.com/lufficc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lufficc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lufficc/SSD/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
