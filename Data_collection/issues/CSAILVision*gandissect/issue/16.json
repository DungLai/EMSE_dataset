Am i missing something here?\r\ni have tried importing and running server.py in google colab as well as using the command line interface and getting the same bug for both.\r\n\r\nEdit1: I have realised why i don't have a settings attribute. In the __main__ file, the settings is created by creating a dictionary of all the arguments passed in when running netdissect on the command line. The generate_report() function in dissection.py will pass the settings into dissect.json which is the config that is passed into load_projects() but only if there is a value for settings. The value for settings is defaulted to None and since i'm importing dissection.py into google colab, the settings value doesn't change and isn't passed into the top_record dictionary which stores the report. Therefore, config.settings doesn't exist and so i get the bug from above. I am going to work on editing the dissection code so that it adds a settings field to the report. If i can get that working, i will post the updated version here so that people are able to dissect a model and load the server to view the dissection without using the command line.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CSAILVision/gandissect/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CSAILVision/gandissect/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
