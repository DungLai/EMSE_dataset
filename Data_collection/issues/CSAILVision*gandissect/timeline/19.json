See the following lines\n\nhttps://github.com/CSAILVision/gandissect/blob/master/script/setup_env.sh#L71-L72\n\nBut the choice of CUDA_HOME might be the wrong choice for your system - you\ncan try editing the same file that is created by that line to change it to\npoint to the parent directory that contains your installation of nvcc on\nyour system.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Oct 19, 2020 at 10:13 PM
