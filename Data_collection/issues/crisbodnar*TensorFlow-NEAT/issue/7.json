I've tried the following input formats with no success:\r\n\r\n- Passing a **list** of numpy arrays with size (84,)\r\n  - Yields: ValueError: Argument must be a dense tensor: [array([0., 0., ... 0., 0.])] - got shape [1, 84], but wanted [1].\r\n- Passing a numpy array with size (84,)\r\n  - Yields: ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 1 for 'matmul' (op: 'MatMul') with input shapes: [7,84], [84].\r\n- Passing a numpy array with size (1, 84)\r\n  - Yields: AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'numpy'\r\n\r\nAll the example code has worked for me and I've set breakpoints in the example to compare my input to that of the examples. Any help is appreciated! I'm very interested in this project.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crisbodnar/TensorFlow-NEAT/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crisbodnar/TensorFlow-NEAT/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
