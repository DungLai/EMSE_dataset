I observed that the result is pretty bad in general, and I am not sure what I'm doing wrong. I am suspecting a bug, but I'm not confident. \r\n\r\n**Image vs ground truth:** \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20723780/131149413-107ab8d8-a00d-4388-abff-d1091a532808.png)\r\n\r\n**HED output:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20723780/131149457-d42283e6-1e2f-40cc-b182-2f083ca0381b.png)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, if the value of an individual cell is greater than 0.5, I round it off to 1 before estimating the F1 score. The image after rounding off looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20723780/131150555-c378e9dc-64f9-4069-8a4b-901e2e059669.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, I calculate the F-Score using the following code: \r\n\r\nHere, the `gt` is the groundtruth and the `pred` array is the prediction image from HED. \r\n```\r\ntp = np.sum(pred[np.where(pred == 1)] == gt[np.where(pred == 1)])\r\nfp = np.sum(pred[np.where(pred == 1)] != gt[np.where(pred == 1)])\r\nprecision = tp / (tp + fp)\r\n\r\n# recall\r\nfn = np.sum(pred[np.where(pred == 0)] != gt[np.where(pred == 0)])\r\nrecall = tp / (tp + fn)\r\n\r\n# f-value\r\nfvalue = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get a value (F1 score) of **0.1 to 0.2.** \r\nThe paper and the Github descriptions state much higher values (>0.7). Can anyone guide me regarding what could be going wrong? Since I am using the same metric and the same score, it is a little tricky. \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.
