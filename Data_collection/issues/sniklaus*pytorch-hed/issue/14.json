After `python run.py`, I got the following error,\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"run.py\", line 154, in <module>\r\n    PIL.Image.fromarray((tenOutput.clip(0.0, 1.0).numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0)[:, :, 0] * 255.0).astype(numpy.uint8)).save(arguments_strOut)\r\nAttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'clip'\r\n\r\nWhen I changed the `clip` back to `clamp`, it worked. Could you be so kind to provide me with any clues on this?
