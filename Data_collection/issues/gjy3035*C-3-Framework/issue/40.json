So I have some question about SHHA setting.\r\n(I use batch=8, cropped images(576,768), lr=1e-5, epoch=150)\r\n1. Train on SHHA use one batch or multi batch？I find it support both one and multi batch in the code.\r\n2. When training, use the original image or the cropped image(576,768) ?\r\n3. About learning rate and epoch setting?(same as SHHB? lr=1e-5, epoch =100?)\r\n4. When testing, use the original image‘s size may not multiple of 16, how to deal with it？","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/40/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
