Then I want to know the coordinate of the keypoint. It's easy to know this coordinate from gt heatmap as there is only one max value in gt heatmap, but the predict heatmap has many max value for each keypoint. I can't find coordinate of this keypoints.\r\nDo you have some suggestions ,or any paper  you suggest  reading?","closed_by":{"login":"FanShuixing","id":35692924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjkyOTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35692924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing","html_url":"https://github.com/FanShuixing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FanShuixing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/76/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
