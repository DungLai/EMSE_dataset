I have calculated base on this pytorch example but get the results is really far from you on SHHB dataset.  (https://github.com/wenwei202/pytorch-examples/blob/autogrow/cifar10/get_mean_std.py). With result on train set std  = [1.0160, 1.0153, 1.0140]\r\n\r\nMany thank, \r\n\r\nRon","closed_by":{"login":"Ronpie","id":51436867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDM2ODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51436867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie","html_url":"https://github.com/Ronpie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronpie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/86/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/86/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
