I am able to download the QNRF and SHB datasets from the links you have provided and able to train and test, awesome :)  But when I do the same with Shanghai tech part A (SHA), I am unable to proceed with training with input and output tensor mismatch. I will share the logs if required, but are there any extra steps required for training of Shanghai tech Part A. I have downloaded training data from the dataset provided in the link (Onedrive link).\r\nIt would be of great help, if you suggest any steps.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
