I am having some trouble with the visualization of density map. Say, if I have got the density map using matlab codes: im_density = get_density_map_gaussian(im,annPoints,15,4); how to draw the density maps like the ones in the papers? I've tried some matlab codes, the outputs are all weird...\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24791613/84976322-2a1df200-b15a-11ea-8940-c8b3820a46fe.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BJTUJia","id":24791613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzkxNjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24791613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia","html_url":"https://github.com/BJTUJia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BJTUJia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
