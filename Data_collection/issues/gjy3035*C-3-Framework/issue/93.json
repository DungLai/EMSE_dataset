I only use it for looking up settings. I noticed that the point masks are blurred with a Gaussian kernel size 15 and a sigma of 4. When I use the same settings in OpenCV this will result in cropped Gaussians because 15 isn't large enough for a sigma of 4. I'm using 25.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to bring this up as a potential problem.
