性。\r\n毕竟对于验证集的选择，大家会有不同的方法和随机结果。而这种现象在人群计数这类小数据集上，对实验的可复现性影响较大。\r\n在以往我们自己的论文中，都是严格按照随机策略划分验证集。因此在GCC数据集上的性能要低于C3F的结果的（相信你通过对比也可以发现）。\r\n这样做性能差一些的原因是，我们无法保证所选取的验证集跟测试集的分布完全一致。\r\n\r\n综上，为确保实验数据、参数一致情况下的复现，我们在repo中将测试当成了验证集。关于这一点我们在昨天刚刚发布的中文介绍（https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zUcLZ41mse7qRqZgXlMvvg ）里的Q&A部分也有回答。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/comments/492482408/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gjy3035","id":7986462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7986462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035","html_url":"https://github.com/gjy3035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2351751753,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM1MTc1MTc1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/events/2351751753","actor":{"login":"gjy3035","id":7986462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7986462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035","html_url":"https://github.com/gjy3035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-20T01:19:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/comments/494628038","html_url":"https://github.com/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/19#issuecomment-494628038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/19","id":494628038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDYyODAzOA==","user":{"login":"wsz1029","id":16558225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU4MjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16558225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029","html_url":"https://github.com/wsz1029","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T02:28:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T02:31:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"您好，仅针对人群计数这个任务来说，如果我直接拿测试集当验证集，这样得到的结果虽然好，但是在学术上是否有过拟合测试集的嫌疑？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/comments/494628038/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wsz1029","id":16558225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU4MjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16558225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029","html_url":"https://github.com/wsz1029","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsz1029/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/comments/513463970","h
