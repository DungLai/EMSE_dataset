During the training process, you can select the best model (best MAE or best val loss) on validation and then evaluate the model on the test set. \r\n\r\nSince everyone may have a different strategy to select the validation data (5%, 10%, etc.), we do not provide our validation data. At the same time, we use the test set for validation to guarantee that everyone can reproduce each experiment successfully.
