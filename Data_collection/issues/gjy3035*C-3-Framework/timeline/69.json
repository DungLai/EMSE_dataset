The overfitting problem is caused by a small data volume. If you want to generalize other images (web or your own), you should select similar labeled data. For congested scenes, an alternative way is using the joint of Shanghai A, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU-Crowd. For the surveillance scene, you can use some sparse datasets, such as the Crowd_surv dataset. (The NWPU-Crowd and Crowd_surv are new large-scale datasets, we will provide the result on them.)\r\n\r\nUsing your dataset, you should create the folder and files like ```dataset/SHHB```. And modify  ```config.py```.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gjy3035/C-3-Framework/issues/comments/585492537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gjy3035","id":7986462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7986462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035","html_url":"https://github.com/gjy3035","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjy3035/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
