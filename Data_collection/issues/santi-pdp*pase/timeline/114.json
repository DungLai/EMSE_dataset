It has to do with the version of PyTorch. If you don't need the most recent version of pytorch, you can downgrade see (see [issue 29 ](https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn/issues/29#issuecomment-660058989) from pytorch-qrnn repo).  \r\nA workaround I'm trying without downgrading pytorch is to use fastai's implementation of QRNN. I've created a [fork](https://github.com/kachiO/pase) of the PASE repo. `pip install ninja` and then upgrade or install fastai `pip install -U fastai`. The in `pase.models.modules.py` [import QRNN from fastai](https://github.com/kachiO/pase/blob/96afacbb0c4985e14d42253c9cc85158c49881f7/pase/models/modules.py#L13) and update [line 55](https://github.com/kachiO/pase/blob/96afacbb0c4985e14d42253c9cc85158c49881f7/pase/models/modules.py#L55) when the QRNN module is called. \r\nThis works for the inference example presented in the README of the repo  \r\n```\r\nfrom pase.models.frontend import wf_builder\r\npase = wf_builder('cfg/frontend/PASE+.cfg').eval()\r\npase.load_pretrained('FE_e199.ckpt', load_last=True, verbose=True)\r\npase.cuda()\r\n# Now we can forward waveforms as Torch tensors\r\nimport torch\r\nx = torch.randn(1, 1, 100000) # example with random noise to check shape\r\n# y size will be (1, 256, 625), which are 625 frames of 256 dims each\r\ny = pase(x.cuda(), device='cuda') \r\n```\r\nDisclaimer: The output dimensions match. I haven't checked whether the values match because that would require downgrading pytorch. I think for inference, this should work.
