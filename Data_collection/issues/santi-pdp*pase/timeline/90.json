It's most likely IO related due to slow disk access (i.e. reading waves, rather than augmenting them later). Where do you keep your actual dataset, on gdrive? This is likely to be very slow to read.\r\n\r\nOn PASE side, the code has option to cache the waveforms (or even whole transforms) into memory and you should check it out (if you have enough RAM on virtual node to store whole dataset, which I think for 10 hours should not be an issue). Note, this caching works on-the-fly, so first epoch would be still slow as the cache is being build.  Due to how the on-the-fly augmentation works, I suggest to cache wave-forms only (not the whole transforms).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you need to check what are the other options to link faster storage in Colab directly, i.e. is it possible to copy files to Colab, rather than link them from GDrive? Can you copy them over from Gdrive to local node where the code actually runs prior to the actual training? (if that's the case data is accessed from GDrive). I do not have enough hands on expertise with Colab to advise any particular solution, but I am sure people experienced similar issues on their side, and things are widely discussed online.

So one more thing you want to try is to limit each data loading thread to one CPU core. (at math algebra level) Now it looks like each thread is trying to max out the whole machine, which is likely to lead to some race conditions thus limit the performance.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a default pytorch installation, it means it links to intel's mkl. To force one thread to not use more than 1 core, type smth like this in top level run.sh script: ```export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1```\r\n\r\nLook at load average stat in htop screenshot -> it stays at 65, while given your machine is 16 core should be around 16.  (load is not necessarily linked to cpu usage, it could be io too). But its worth to fix all potential issues.

And unlabeled data for self-supervised should be large.\r\n\r\nAnd after reading through the comments above, it's still unclear how to use the cache. And I found the code is caching all the wav data to ram, why isn't the transform is the bottleneck ? have you do any profile
