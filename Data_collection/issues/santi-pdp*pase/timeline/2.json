I have just uploaded a config file `cfg/SincNet_worker.cfg` that incorporates the training mechanism of SincNet as MI-only in case you refer to the unsupervised mutual information training. The way to train it would be by specifying the flag `--net_cfg` in the `train.py` script to point to the new config file I mention. \r\nIf you mean the supervised training part, then have a look at `spk_id/nnet.py`, where you have to specify the PASE config `--fe_cfg ../cfg/PASE.cfg` without a pretrained ckpt (nothing in `--fe_ckpt`) and it will attach the selected classifier `--model mlp` on top of the front-end. In this case the way to specify the training/validation/test partitions is pretty standard, you handle the `--train_guia` with filepath pointers, the `--test_guia` too, and validation will be selected as a randomly sampled subset of `--train_guia` files (controlled with the ratio parameter `--va_split` that defaults to 20%).\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nSanti","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/comments/485068553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"santi-pdp","id":7583502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODM1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7583502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp","html_url":"https://github.com/santi-pdp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2289362172,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4OTM2MjE3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/2289362172","actor":{"login":"hdubey","id":4490367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTAzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4490367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey","html_url":"https://github.com/hdubey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-20T08:08:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2289362173,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODkzNjIxNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/2289362173","actor":{"login":"hdubey","id":4490367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTAzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4490367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey","html_url":"https://github.com/hdubey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hdubey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-20T08:08:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2290289128,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI5MDI4OTEyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/2290289128","actor":{"login":"santi-pdp","id":7583502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODM1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7583502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp","html_url":"https://github.com/santi-pdp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santi-pdp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-21T20:31:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/comments/485340759","html_url":"https://github.com/santi-pdp/pase/issues/2#issuecomment-485340759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/2","id":485340759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4
