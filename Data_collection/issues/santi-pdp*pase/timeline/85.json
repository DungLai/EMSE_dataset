In that case, an scp here is only a list of files (paths) to wavs you want to use to train/refine your model. There is not any utterance ids here (as it is the case with Kaldi scps).\r\n\r\nFor further training in self-supervised way on your data, you would need to generate data config and related stats file with normalisation stats and then keep training as in standard PASE+ case (look more for readme). \r\n\r\nThough we only released encoder so far, ideally in keep-training case you would like also the weights of workers. I am sure, we can share this too, right @mravanelli ?\r\n\r\nIf you want to refine weights in a supervised way on your data, the encoder weights we shared to date are sufficient, just load them into the compute graph in torch, add your bits on top (follow up layers if any, your target objective) and keep training (i.e. a bit like a TIMIT recipe in ASR/ folder).\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/comments/586909646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pswietojanski","id":6951203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6951203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski","html_url":"https://github.com/pswietojanski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3043030410,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA0MzAzMDQxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/3043030410","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-17T09:57:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3043030413,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNDMwMzA0MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/3043030413","actor":{"login":"mravanelli","id":16886998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16886998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli","html_url":"https://github.com/mravanelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mravanelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-17T09:57:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pswietojanski","id":6951203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6951203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski","html_url":"https://github.com/pswietojanski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T09:59:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T09:59:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/84","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/84/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sant

Yes, both the issues are related\r\n\r\n> In that case, an scp here is only a list of files (paths) to wavs you want to use to train/refine your model. There is not any utterance ids here (as it is the case with Kaldi scps).\r\n\r\nRight, I noticed that the .scp here is just the path to the .wav files. And Kaldi gets you an `utterance_id wav_path` file. So, how should I generate this .scp file? Is it as simple as changing the extension of file wav.txt (with wav file path, one in each line) to wav.scp? OR do I need to change the kaldi scripts to store only the wav_path?\r\n\r\n> For further training in self-supervised way on your data, you would need to generate data config and related stats file with normalisation stats and then keep training as in standard PASE+ case (look more for readme). Though we only released encoder so far, ideally in keep-training case you would like also the weights of workers\r\n\r\nYes, I would need the weights of workers. Or I don't fine tune the given encoder weights (the self supervised way), and train a PASE+ model from scratch on my data instead. Post that, I ll store the encoder+workers weights and use them later, when I get more data and would want to fine tune the PASE+.\r\n\r\n> If you want to refine weights in a supervised way on your data, the encoder weights we shared to date are sufficient, just load them into the compute graph in torch, add your bits on top (follow up layers if any, your target objective) and keep training (i.e. a bit like a TIMIT recipe in ASR/ folder).\r\n\r\nThe supervised training way is clear. I ll add a decoder/classifier on top.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/comments/586927521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MittalShruti","id":5301961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDE5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5301961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti","html_url":"https://github.com/MittalShruti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3043180123,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA0MzE4MDEyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/3043180123","actor":{"login":"pswietojanski","id":6951203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6951203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski","html_url":"https://github.com/pswietojanski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-17T10:37:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3043180129,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNDMxODAxMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/events/3043180129","actor":{"login":"pswietojanski","id":6951203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6951203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski","html_url":"https://github.com/pswietojanski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-17T10:37:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/comments/586949538","html_url":"https://github.com/santi-pdp/pase/issues/85#issuecomment-586949538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/85","id":586949538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njk0OTUzOA==","user":{"login":"pswietojanski","id":6951203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6951203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski","html_url":"https://github.com/pswietojanski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pswietojanski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T11:
