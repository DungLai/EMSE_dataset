I had a look at codes and paper. The architecture is interesting. I want to train this architecture on Librispeech for speaker ID in same say as SincNet is trained. What will be the best way to do it. Assume I have all training and test data prepared as per the protocols of SincNet paper. I want to extract supervised Bottleneck features after it is trained to see how overall FER compares with original SincNet.
