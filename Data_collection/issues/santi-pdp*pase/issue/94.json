Using self-supervised learning in this task is really amazing.\r\nWhen I want to train this model for detecting fake audios using ASVspoof2019 LA dataset, I find some problems.\r\nThere are countless kinds of fake audios from different people. If I simply using 1 for fake audios and 0 for bonafide ones, Is it appropriate? or if there might be some appropriate ways for me to handle this problem ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nlabels=load_label()\r\ndic=dict()\r\n\r\nfor item in labels:\r\n    item=item.split(\" \")\r\n    if item[-1]==\"bonafide\":\r\n        dic[item[0]+\".flac\"]=0\r\n    else:\r\n        dic[item[0]+\".flac\"]=1\r\nnp.save(\"ASVspoof2019_dict.npy\",dic)\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
