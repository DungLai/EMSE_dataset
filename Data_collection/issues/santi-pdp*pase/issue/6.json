Now I want to use it for emotion recognition on a different dataset consisting of different emotions. So I want to know in detail about the emorec folder which has the script for emotion recognition.  I tried run_IEMOCAP_fast.py on my emotion data which is basically for evalutaion. how to use the train.py i.e what parameters I need to pass it to train on my own data for emotion. I have the training, test files and a JSON file having a key as file name and value as a label .","closed_by":{"login":"singhaki","id":18519731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki","html_url":"https://github.com/singhaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
