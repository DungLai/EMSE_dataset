The repo has steps to train the model from scratch. \r\n\r\nI want to fine-tune the already trained encoder-workers model on my speech data, so that I can get better features. Importing just the encoder as nn.Module, won't let me use the workers, and I won't be able to extract features the (self/)unsupervised learning way.\r\n\r\nHow should I do it?  \r\n\r\n[EDIT] Also, e.g., I trained the PASE+ model on dataset1. Now after training, get more speech data for training (dataset2). In such a case, I would want to 'fine-tune' the model trained on dataset1, using this new dataset2. And not want to train from scratch on dataset2 + dataset1.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MittalShruti","id":5301961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDE5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5301961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti","html_url":"https://github.com/MittalShruti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MittalShruti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
