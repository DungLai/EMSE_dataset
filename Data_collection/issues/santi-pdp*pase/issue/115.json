For example, in the prosody worker, let's say I want to extract the jitter and the shimmer with the already extracted features (Log(f0), energy,UV,zero crossing rate). To do this, I figured out that I should modify the minion prosody in \"transform.py\" by adding the extraction of those features. Is there another related script that I should modify based on this? Also is there any way to add importance to one worker than another in the extraction of features?\r\nThanks!!","closed_by":{"login":"Imenbaa","id":45403868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDAzODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45403868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa","html_url":"https://github.com/Imenbaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imenbaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/santi-pdp/pase/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
