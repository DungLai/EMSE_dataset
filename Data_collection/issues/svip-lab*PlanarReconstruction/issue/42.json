I was curious about your experiments on depth estimation.\r\nOne thing I noticed on PlaneNet is that when they finetune on NYUv2 with the **depth loss** only, they get less and less regions detected as planar (only the layout).\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you observe a similar phenomenon in your case, and if it explains the depth performance improvement.\r\nCould you maybe share some snapshots of [non-planar mask, instance mask, depth maps], before and after fine-tuning with your loss in Equation 10.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25643393/134024946-a1b7ddd4-3377-4737-a281-8089aae47b5c.png)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
