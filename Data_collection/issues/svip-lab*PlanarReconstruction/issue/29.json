I am wondering if the code also includes the implementation of Stage II, namely the piece-wise planar 3D model mapping? It seems to me that the code only includes Stage I, maybe I inadvertently omitted some part in the code. It will be great if you could help clarify the implementation structure. Thank you in advance.","closed_by":{"login":"bertjiazheng","id":8075304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng","html_url":"https://github.com/bertjiazheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
