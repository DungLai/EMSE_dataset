The 2 GPUs are same model and I am using Pytorch 1.0.1. Has anyone else encountered this problem and how to fix this please? Many thanks!\r\n\r\nJohan","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
