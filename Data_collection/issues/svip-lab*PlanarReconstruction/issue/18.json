That's because if we are talking about plane segmentation, we must have a clear idea about what a plane is. However, after seeing some of the labels you used, I have found some inconsistency concerning whether to classify a kind of surface into a plane.\r\n\r\nFor example, in one image of the test set, the whiteboard and the wall share the same plane label. Nevertheless, in another image, the board and the wall itâ€™s against have different labels.\r\n\r\n![b1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31812793/63659834-3c532c00-c7e6-11e9-822c-766a3b59ee29.png)\r\n![b2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31812793/63659833-3c532c00-c7e6-11e9-8ae4-018941f76080.png)\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: original image, prediction, and ground truth.\r\n\r\nAnd could you please tell me what is your initial motivation to concentrate on this area? Is that mainly for 3D reconstruction from 2D images? And do you think the inconsistency in labels have no huge impact on reaching your goal? \r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bertjiazheng","id":8075304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng","html_url":"https://github.com/bertjiazheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
