For the segmentation branch, based on my previous limited understanding, embedding style segmentation might be less accurate that the mask-rcnn ones. And also the kmeans cluster step is less computing efficient on GPUs for both training and inference. Thus, I wonder does the framework work if replacing the embedding instance segmentation branch with mask-rcnn?\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"blueardour","id":4530223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzAyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4530223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour","html_url":"https://github.com/blueardour","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
