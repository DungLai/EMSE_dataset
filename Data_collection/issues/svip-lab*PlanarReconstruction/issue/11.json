Congratulations for your great achievement with this research!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if have any implementation that I could perform to use the plane instance segmentations generated (that represent floors or walls) in the end of Stage I to calculate the UV coordinates and replace it with a different texture like PlaneNet does with Manhattan world assumption.\r\n\r\nWould be very interesting to see that kind application implemented in near future with AR.\r\n\r\nBest.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
