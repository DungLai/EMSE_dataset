But such algorithms are sensitive to data noises and outliers, thus introduce inconsistency in the annotations. You can refer to section 4.4 of our paper, where we discuss this inconsistent issue and provide some possible solutions to address these issues.

If you care about the semantic information. Then you can fit the planes within each semantic instance segmentation. Thus each plane instance only corresponds to a single semantic category. \r\n2. If you only focus on the geometry and do not care about the semantic, you can merge the nearby plane instances.\r\n\r\nYou can refer to the [fitting code](https://github.com/art-programmer/PlaneNet/tree/master/data_preparation) provided by PlaneNet.
