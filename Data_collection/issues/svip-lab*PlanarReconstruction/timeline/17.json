And I have another question about the count matrix used in [compare_segmentations.m](https://github.com/fuy34/planerecover/blob/master/eval/compare_segmentations.m#L84)\r\n\r\n\r\nline 79 `segmentcount1=max(max(sampleLabels1)); %class # in seg_1` \r\nline 80 `segmentcount2=max(max(sampleLabels2)); %class # in seg_2` \r\nline 84 `n=zeros(segmentcount1,segmentcount2);` \r\n\r\nThese lines confued me since in your [main.py](https://github.com/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/blob/master/main.py), values in variables `predict_segmentation` and `gt_seg` range from 0 to 20, in which I believe 0 denotes non-planar pixels. So my question is, did you consider about the 0 class, namely those non-planar pixels, when calculating the count matrix and Rand Index? And  an equivalent question is, if there are 21 classes (from 0 to 20) in both prediction and ground truth images, is the shape of your count matrix (20, 20) or (21, 21)?\r\n\r\nThanks.
