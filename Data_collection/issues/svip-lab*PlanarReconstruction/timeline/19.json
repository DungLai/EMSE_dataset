I ever looked into the PlaneRCNN repo, the code seemed to be more complex that this one. I prefer this repo as the framework is clean and simple. The trouble for me is the mean shift part for its risking of long exection time on ARM cpus. Thus, I'm considering to replace the embedding style segmentation to proposal one (ARM computing library seems to provide the support of Mask RCNN or NMS already).\r\n\r\nWhatever, with no respect to deployment on specific platforms currently, do you think it's promising to obtain the same accuracy (or even better) if substituting embedding segmentation with region proposal one?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/comments/527003199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"blueardour","id":4530223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzAyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4530223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour","html_url":"https://github.com/blueardour","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueardour/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2599929226,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU5OTkyOTIyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/events/2599929226","actor":{"login":"bertjiazheng","id":8075304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng","html_url":"https://github.com/bertjiazheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T05:07:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2599929227,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1OTk5MjkyMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/events/2599929227","actor":{"login":"bertjiazheng","id":8075304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng","html_url":"https://github.com/bertjiazheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T05:07:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/comments/527008672","html_url":"https://github.com/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/19#issuecomment-527008672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction/issues/19","id":527008672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzAwODY3Mg==","user":{"login":"bertjiazheng","id":8075304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng","html_url":"https://github.com/bertjiazheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertjiazheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":f
