SGC precomputes feature-propagation `A^KX`.\r\n2. SGC collapes K linear transformations into one. Namely, there is only one weight matrix and only 1 matrix multiplication is required for the forward pass. \r\n3. Once the feature-propagation is pre-computed, only training data needs to be computed during the forward and backward propagation. In contrast, GCN computes both the training and testing data because of its transductive nature. \r\n\r\nWhen analyzing the speedup of SGC, you have to take all of these factors into consideration. Therefore, the actual dataset characteristics are very important and can lead to different amount of acceleration. \r\n\r\nHope this answer helps.
