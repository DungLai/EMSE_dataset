Tianyi, thank you so much for answering the question promptly. Really appreciated. I did consider A^K * X as the embedding, however, (not trying to be a pain here), the outcome does not fit into the classical definition of node embedding since the output is fixed to the feature dimension. For example, if the node feature dimension is 128 then I can not get 64-d node embedding from SGC unless there is an additional step in place.  See if it makes sense at your side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/comments/725944354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"titaniumrain","id":4322892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjI4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4322892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain","html_url":"https://github.com/titaniumrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/comments/725945868","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/24#issuecomment-725945868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/24","id":725945868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTk0NTg2OA==","user":{"login":"Tiiiger","id":19514537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTE0NTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19514537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiiiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-12T09:08:35Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T09:08:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"hi @titaniumrain \r\n\r\nthat is correct. \r\n\r\nI am curious, why do you want a lower-dimensional feature? \r\n\r\nIs it because the input features are too high-dimensional (and sparse)?

my bad to be brief.

Again just throwing out some ideas. In this case, can you learn a low-dimensional embedding layer? for example just learn a linear layer that project from (large) feature dimension to (low) embedding dimension using the supervision you have from link prediction. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am not very familiar with link prediction but I assume you are taking the inner project between nodes and that's why you are concerned about the computational cost. Learning this linear layer should be very fast because you can still precompute the propagation, which is usually the computation bottleneck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/comments/726411060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tiiiger","id":19514537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTE0NTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19514537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiiiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiiiger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/comments/726731942","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/24#issuecomment-726731942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tiiiger/SGC/issues/24","id":726731942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjczMTk0Mg==","user":{"login":"titaniumrain","id":4322892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjI4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4322892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain","html_url":"https://github.com/titaniumrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titaniumrain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T12:13:52Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T12:13:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yep, what you mentioned is likely what we may end up doing so.
