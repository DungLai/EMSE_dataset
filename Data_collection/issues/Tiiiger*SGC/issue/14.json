And you also claimed this in the paper. I wonder why you chose this optimizer. Why not just use SGD? \r\n\r\nAnd what kind of the optimizer did you use for text classification and semi-supervised geolocation classification when you reported the efficiency? Because I thought different optimizers have different speed efficiency and memory efficiency.  \r\n\r\nCould you provide any insights? Thanks!
