I don't own the moses project and this port done out of convenience. I guess the @moses-smt maintainers know that this repo exists and have let it continue to exist. \r\n\r\nThe issue with [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) from Moses' license is \r\n\r\n> 2.

I reimplemented from scratch for another language and accommodations / improvements were made to the original algorithm, not the library itself.\r\n\r\n - **an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful**: If I would to translate that to words I understand, \"*if you provide a library that uses the modified function, the function should still operates and produce the desired meaningful output that the original should.*\" \r\n    - if the original Perl script outputs space-joined strings and the Python version outputs `list(str)` as token, it should be equally meaningful but the whole stream in, stream out purpose of the original Perl tokenizer script has been converted into a function-return mecahnism, so I'm not sure whether the current port compiles to the LGPL requirments.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't want to change the license to GPL from LGPL unnecessary to respect the original Moses' maintainers' stance on keeping the LGPL, so as a layman not knowing legalese, I have choosen to just repeat the license heading in the README.md\r\n\r\n> GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later version.\r\n\r\nI'm not a lawyer or well-versed in license but if there's any lawyer who would like give their professional advice and consultation on what should be done in terms of licensing of this repository, please feel free to comment in this issue.  \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBTW, `mosestokenizer` is another library that's a Python wrapper to the Perl code, also in https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/tree/master/scripts/tokenizer/mosestokenizer. I've changed the header to `sacremoses` to avoid confusion.
