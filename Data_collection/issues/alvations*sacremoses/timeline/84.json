This is to reduce additional dev work when supporting regexes on deprecated Python version, e.g. #84 and #94 \r\n\r\nWe encourage all users to use Python 3 with `sacremoses` from henchforth. If any Python 2.7 users faces any issues with `0.0.40`, please use this issue to track the problems and only critical issues will be fixed for Python 2.7 on `0.0.40`. \r\n\r\nNew features from `0.0.41` onwards will not be backported.
