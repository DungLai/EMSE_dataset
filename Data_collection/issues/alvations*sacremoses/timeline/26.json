the pipeline is to first have a text file that's non-tokenized, then put it through the tokenizer. \r\n\r\nE.g. if I have the `big.txt` that I would like to preprocess, I'll first do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsacremoses tokenize -j 4 < big.txt > big.txt.tok\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen afterwards, train the truecasing model using the tokenized file, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsacremoses truecase -m big.model -j 4 < big.txt.tok > big.txt.tok.true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above command would first train the truecaser model and save to `big.model`, then take the tokenized file `big.txt.tok` and apply the truecase model to it to produce `big.txt.tok.true`.\r\n\r\nThe truecaser on paper should consider more than Unigrams but in Moses, the truecaser is generally unigram based, c.f. https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/recaser/train-truecaser.perl\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation of the truecaser with n-th order ngrams is call the \"recaser\" from https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/recaser/train-recaser.perl \r\n\r\nIt would require some sort of language model (LM) to be built first and currently, recaser and n-gram language model not implemented in `sacremoses` (yet).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/comments/465831090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alvations","id":1050316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTAzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations","html_url":"https://github.com/alvations","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/comments/465833949","html_url":"https://github.com/alvations/sacremoses/issues/26#issuecomment-465833949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/26","id":465833949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTgzMzk0OQ==","user":{"login":"alvations","id":1050316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTAzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations","html_url":"https://github.com/alvations","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvations/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T02:14:37Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T02:14:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@mlforcada
