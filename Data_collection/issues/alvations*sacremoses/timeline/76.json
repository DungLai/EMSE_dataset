AFAIK, no performance comparison between `re` and `regex` has been officially documented by the author of `regex`, but I suppose that since `regex` implements more functions, it should be slower than `re`, but I'm not sure whether or not the difference in speed is significant. (cf. [Issue #282](https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/282/missing-performance-comparison-with-re))\r\nOne special case: if there's something `regex` can do but `re` cannot, and the code can be greatly simplified, then there might be a non-trivial improvement in speed. e.g. look-behinds in `re` must be fixed-width, but `regex` allows non-fixed-width look-behinds.\r\n2. `re` is part of Python's standard library and `regex` is a 3rd-party library, so updates on `re` is only released when a new version of Python is released and releases of `regex` can be made more frequently. So I suppose that `re` is more stable than `regex`, though that also means new features (including performance optimizations) will be added to `re` slower than `regex` (but in your case new features are not your concerns, I suppose).\r\n3. Changing from `re` to `regex` is not supposed to break the existing rules, as `regex` \"is backwards-compatible with the standard ‘re’ module, but offers additional functionality\" (https://pypi.org/project/regex/)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/comments/590047152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BLKSerene","id":23695743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjk1NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23695743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene","html_url":"https://github.com/BLKSerene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BLKSerene/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/comments/607618510","html_url":"https://github.com/alvations/sacremoses/issues/76#issuecomment-607618510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alvations/sacremoses/issues/76","id":607618510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzYxODUxMA==","user":{"login":"goodmami","id":1428419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjg0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1428419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami","html_url":"https://github.com/goodmami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goodmami/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-02T04:47:43Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T04:47:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"From my limited experience using `regex`, I don't think there's a lot to gain unless you really need greater (but still not full) PCRE compatibility.
