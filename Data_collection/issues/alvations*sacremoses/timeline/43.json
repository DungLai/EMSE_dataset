Have you had a chance to solve the problem with spaces when detokenizing, @alvations ?\r\n\r\n(2) Also, apparently, there is a way to specify the language when creating the

By the way, when the language is not \"en\", \"it\" or \"fr\", but you specify it, the apostrophes are doubly escaped with backslashes for a reason that escapes me:\r\n```\r\nmt=MosesTokenizer(lang=\"es\")\r\nprint(mt.tokenize(\"Un texto con 'comillas' para probar\"))\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\n['Un', 'texto', 'con', '\\\\&apos;', 'comillas', '\\\\&apos;', 'para', 'probar']\r\n```\r\nwhere it would be more appropriate to have (as with lang=\"en\")\r\n```\r\n['Un', 'texto', 'con', '&apos;', 'comillas', '&apos;', 'para', 'probar']\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy the way, I could consider offering my help with Catalan (\"ca\") tokenization. The current French and Italian model partly works, but Catalan has post-verbal pronouns such as\r\n```\r\nInforma-te'n\r\n```\r\nwhich should be tokenized as \r\n```\r\nInforma -te
