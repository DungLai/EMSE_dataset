I have trained the truecaser with a 3032679-word tokenized text in Spanish (1 sentence per line). It generates a model which has 102972 entries (is it a unigram-based truecaser?). Then I use it to truecase a similar text in Spanish which has all been lowercased. The case of many proper nouns, etc., is correctly recovered, but nothing occurs at the beginning of sentences.
