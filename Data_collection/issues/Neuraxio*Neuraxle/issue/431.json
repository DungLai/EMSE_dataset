Please describe.**\r\nThe _HasChildrenMixin is interesting. MetaStepMixin as well, and MetaStep, and TruncableStep. However, these steps implies pushing to the context and deepends not only the stack trace, but also the subfolders upon saving, and the flat hyperparameter naming addresses in the apply methods. What if a wrapper could be invisible to all and have its named skipped in the tree ? E.g.: assertion wrappers shouldn't make the subfolders nested deeper with another name for the assertion wrapper. Same for some other kind of wrappers out there. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n`class _GhostHigherOrderStepMixin(_HasChildrenMixin)` that would not affect pathing. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNo other alternatives imagined. However, I fear that doing this will mess up with the savers' paths and won't allow for properly saving and reloading those ghost higher order steps. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNeuraxle Steps are like UI/Frontend frameworks' concepts of Components. Read more here: \r\n\r\n- https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\r\n\r\nSo \"higher order\" means \"wrapper\" in our language, and \"step\" is like \"component\". \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
