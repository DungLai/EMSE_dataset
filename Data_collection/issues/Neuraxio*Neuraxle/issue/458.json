the bug**\r\nWe see here that the `higher_score_is_better=False` should be true for an accuracy score, instead of False:\r\n- https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/hyperparameter_tuning.html\r\n\r\nMoreover, this documentation page is getting more and more seen to new users from looking at the website's traffic statistics. It should be corrected. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRead the tutorial and realize something is wrong. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe accuracy should has an `higher_score_is_better=True` flag as it ought to be maximised by the AutoML solver rather than minimized. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHow is the documentation example achieving good results with this broken flag ? Is the AutoML solver broken in such a way that this flag is inverted ? It should be a priority to test and fix this is this is still a mistake. \r\n\r\nNote: I think this was really a bug and that last year it was corrected. Perhaps the documentation example was just not updated and that things are working fine. \r\n\r\nPlease notice this issue @vincent-antaki ","closed_by":{"login":"vincent-antaki","id":74119210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTE5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74119210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-antaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
