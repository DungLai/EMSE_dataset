Please describe.**\r\nBaseTransformers instances implement _HasHyperparameters and  _HasHyperparameterSpace, both of which assign a RecursiveDict to respectively self.hyperparameters and self.hyperparameter_space. But, since every step is responsible for keeping its own hp / hp space, I believe we do not need to have RecursiveDict instance at this point.\r\n\r\nJust to make it clear, HyperparameterSamples / HyperparameterSpace still are relevant classes even with the suggested change and I'm I no way suggesting to remove them. They are crucial to the set/update/get mechanisms defined by _HasHyperparameter and  _HasHyperparameterSpace\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRemoving the casting to HyperparameterSamples / HyperparameterSpace when setting self.hyperparameters / self.hyperparameter_space in _HasHyperparameters and  _HasHyperparameterSpace 's init/set/update methods. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could keep it as it is now. Since the modifications of #435, hp handling doesn't cost all that much in term of execution time. This is clearly a low-priority change.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
