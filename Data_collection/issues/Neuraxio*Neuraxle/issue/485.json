Please describe.**\r\nWe may want to apply operations recursively on the context and its services using recursive dict keys such as \"context__logger\" when doing `pipeline.apply(...)` to apply things in the context as well. This also allows for nesting services one into another. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- `class BaseService(... some mixins)`: BaseService could use some mixins. It would \r\n- `class ExecutionContext(_HasChildrenMixin)`: The context contains many services and is indexable by strings such as `context[\"logger\"]`. \r\n- `class TruncableStep` would inherit from the new mixin of the execution step to have indexable things like `truncable_step[\"step\"]`. So the TruncableStep is refactored so as to extract a new mixin like or linked to the `_HasChildrenMixin` and this new mixin that would NOT be a step could be used for the ExecutionContext's service indexing (Interface Segregation Principle - ISP). \r\n\r\nTo sum up: new mixins are required, and they may be refactored out of existing classes to extract behavior out of the steps to give it to the services, but without requiring the services to be steps. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nServices, and the context, could be steps. But that is overkill because services don't have hyperparameters, and don't have other things as well. Services should be more lightweight than steps. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- This would also allow for the issue #440 to be fixed using SharedHyperparamDistribution registered in a context service. \r\n- This could help for fixing issue #483 to have BaseLoggers and BaseAsserters services. \r\n- Fixing this issue would allow for #484: The services can have a base cloner by default. \r\n\r\nFYI @vincent-antaki ","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
