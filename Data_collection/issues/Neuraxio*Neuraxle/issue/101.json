is a discussion issue. It is about the abstract base classes of scipy. Those ones: \r\n1. [rv_continuous](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.html#scipy.stats.rv_continuous)\r\n2. [rv_discrete](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_discrete.html#scipy.stats.rv_discrete)\r\n3. [rv_histogram](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_histogram.html#scipy.stats.rv_histogram)\r\n\r\nThe question: should each of our distribution classes inherit from scipy stats distributions?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, should we have the `.to_scipy_rv()` or `.from_scipy_rv(rv: Union[rv_continuous, rv_discrete, rv_histogram])` methods in our distributions and in our spaces?\r\n\r\nAlso, the [`.rvs method of scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.rvs.html#scipy.stats.rv_continuous.rvs) optionally accepts an `random_state = None or int or np.random.RandomState instance` optional argument. It might be interesting that we have the same optional argument for the reproducibility of results. \r\n\r\nOr should we just use those distributions and delete all our own? Or perhaps keep our own, but make them such that they are classes to more easily create the existing scipy distributions? (e.g.: in our LogUniform, our arguments min and max are simple to interpret, and I'm not sure that there is a LogUniform in scipy. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? \r\n\r\nI think that there is something to do for sure to allow for greater compatibility with the Python ecosystem and other AutoML frameworks when we'll integrate them. One of the goals of Neuraxle is to be as compatible as possible. \r\n\r\nSo I see these possible avenues: \r\n1. Inherit from the scipy distributions in each of our distributions. This is very cool but might require coding manually lots of methods we won't even use. Or perhaps we could keep some of those methods unimplemented and just throw an error message to ask for contributing and opening a PR to Neuraxle with a link to our repo if all the methods are ever needed. \r\n2. Have a `.to_scipy_rv()` or `.from_scipy_rv(...)` method to convert from one another. However, the `.to_scipy_rv()` method would perhaps do something weird to avoid implementing all the useless methods of point `1.` so it'd be a workaround. The advantage with this is that we might add methods to convert to other frameworks, for instance hyperopt, hyperband, and others. Like doing `to_hyperopt_rv()` and the `from` method, too. \r\n3. Or perhaps we should do as in point `1.`, but also have the methods for converting to other frameworks and so we'd use the scipy stats distribution interface by default anyway?\r\n\r\nI think I like solution 3, although opinions might vary. Any other ideas?\r\n\r\nI'd like your thoughts on this! \r\n@alexbrillant @Eric2Hamel @mlevesquedion @JeromeBlanchet @Vaunorage ","closed_by":{"login":"alexbrillant","id":19400226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDAwMjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19400226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbrillant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/101/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
