This is ok for some distributions (e.g.: quantized distributions, such as RandInt), however for some other distributions, there is no linear (growing) dependency between the values \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nE.g.: in a Choice, there is no transitive relation between the item 0, 1, and 2 of the Choice. This doesn't happend in a RandInt.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe Choice hyperparam to be encoded as a one-hot. And its rounding (as per #466) after undoing the SVD would need to pick the argmax of this one-hot.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n#464 \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
