Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to hand any additional arguments (in addition to the data_inputs and expected_outputs) to the fit / partial_fit function of a step in a neuraxle pipeline. For many applications, e.g. to use sample weights or for online learning this is necessary, see this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64482655/using-fit-params-in-neuraxle-pipeline).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice, if it were possible to provide additional arguments to the fit function of a neuraxle pipeline, which are then handed down to a step in the pipeline as it is done in the default sklearn pipelines.
