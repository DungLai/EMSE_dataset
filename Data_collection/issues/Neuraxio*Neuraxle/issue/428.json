You could redefine Boolean (which should really be called Bernouilli in my opinion) to be Binomial(1,p).\r\n\r\nIn the mean time it is possible to use Choice with custom probabilities to model this distribution.\r\n\r\nEdit :\r\nSide question, lets say that, for my random hyperparameter search, I'd really like to use learning_rate = 10**uniform(-2,-4). That doesn't seem to be an option within the current state of the framework; I'd have to create my own class ExpUniform (which maybe could be already included). Would there be a not too complex way to introduce operator on these distributions instead? Or even if a complex option is on the table, are all attempts at doing this fundamentally overkill and computationally wasteful for the conceptual scope of the distributions in this file?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
