Please describe.**\r\nWhen multithreading, we sometimes need to clone steps, data, and context. We need a way to indicate how to copy this efficiently, as some data, steps, or services, may require different copy techniques (e.g.: in memory repo v.s. on disk repo, tensorflow v2 step, data in the GPU, etc). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nLike we have a Saver for serializing steps to disks, we could have a Cloner to clone steps (and services and perhaps even data). The base cloner would probably attempt to do a copy.copy or copy.deepcopy (investigation needed). \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Doing a simple deepcopy for steps that are seriazliable\r\n- For non-serializable steps such as a tensorflow V2 step, using the savers to save the step and reloading it in the other thread. This is time consuming as it uses disks heavily. We also thought (and tried to use) mounted RAM disks to make this fast, but the dependencies were too heavy and therefore we didn't include this in neuraxle. \r\n\r\nFYI @vincent-antaki ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
