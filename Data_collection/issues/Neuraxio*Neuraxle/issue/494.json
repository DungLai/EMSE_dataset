Please describe.**\r\nShorter hyperparameter getters with static IDE autocompletion. It would be cool to do `self.some_hyperparam` instead of `self.get_hyperparams()[\"some_hyperparam\"]` to access params.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUsing the new MyPy typing system with dataclasses to define spaces and values as such: \r\n```\r\nclass MyStep(BaseStep):\r\n    learning_rate: LogUniform[0.001, 0.1] = 0.01\r\n    n_layers: Quantized[Uniform[1, 3]] = True\r\n    has_residuals_layers: Boolean = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implies that the `_HasHyperparamsSpaceMixin` defines something that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass _HasHyperparamsMixin:\r\n    def __post_init__(self): \r\n        for param in self.__dataclass_fields__: \r\n            self.update_hyperparam({param.name: param.default_value})\r\n\r\nclass _HasHyperparamsSpaceMixin:\r\n    def __post_init__(self): \r\n        for param in self.__dataclass_fields__: \r\n            self.update_hyperparam_space({param.name: param.type})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a hacky solution may be needed to properly use the `@dataclass` which may refuse to work as it should be probably set on the inheriting class. We may need to define the `def __new__(...)` in the `_HasHyperparamsSpaceMixin` or something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Dataclasses combined with MyPy typing\r\n- Custom getattr() and setattr() methods could be explored otherwise\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n#478","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
