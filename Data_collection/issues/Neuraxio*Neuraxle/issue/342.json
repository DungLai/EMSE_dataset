Do you think we should do this? It's already fine to import scikit-learn, but this makes our dependencies bigger and it could be optimized. \r\n\r\n1. The method _sklearn_to_neuraxle_step should check types using their string names to avoid importing Scikit-Learn directly in `base.py`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3862310/how-to-find-all-the-subclasses-of-a-class-given-its-name\r\n2. The conversion to scikit-learn could probably be a wrapper instead of a method of the BaseStep. I would prefer another solution if there is another way to move the import elsewhere. In fact the wrapper is already written locally within the `.tosklearn` class but should be moved elsewhere. \r\n\r\nUltimately, this means that we could remove scikit-learn as a dependency of the project, and instead create a neuraxle-sklearn installable pluging. \r\n\r\nNote: the SKLearn wrapper would need to remain in Neuraxle to avoid breaking changes. This should be possible without importing scikit-learn.
