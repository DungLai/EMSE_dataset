This is done because the trial hash is dependent on the value of the hyperparameters and these value change during execution. This makes it harder to see the mapping between log file and run, as most information (such as generated image and pipeline dump) are stored using the trial_hash while the log is under the trial number. Furthermore this also has the following side effect that if, for some kind of reason, you run a second AutoML loop with the same HyperparamsJSONRepository, then the log already present would be overwritten (even though the rest of the trial information would still be ok).\r\n\r\nI feel like the solution to this problem is simple : have the trial_hash be fixed by trial (instead of hyperparameter dependent) and use the trial_hash in the name of the log file instead of the trial number\r\n\r\nBonus : This would in part solve issue #493. It should be done by anyone which attempt to complete #504.\r\n\r\nNote : I was under the impression I've logged this issue already but am unable to find it at the moment. So there might be a possible duplicate.","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
