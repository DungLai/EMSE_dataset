This sometimes causes a recursion error when the pipeline runner gets its steps setted everywhere at once with `set_steps` and loops on itself. \r\n\r\nQuick fix: do a copy of the pipeline runner in the constructor of the Pipeline as such: \r\n    `self.pipeline_runner: BasePipelineRunner = copy(pipeline_runner)`\r\n\r\nBetter ways to fix that may be possible.
