please notice this to avoid using numpy. \r\n\r\nIt's not for no reason that there is a package `neuraxle.steps.numpy` for numpy steps: regular steps should NOT use numpy, or at least avoid to use it as much as possible to keep Neuraxle generic. \r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nToo many steps use numpy where they shouldn't\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUse a StepClonerForEachDataInput or a FlattenForEach\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe input data may be lists of strings or other types that are possibly incompatible with numpy or of discontinuous nested shapes\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDon't call np.array in the data containers of the handle methods.
