This complexifies the maintenance and addition of new features. For instance: \r\n- Choice\r\n- FixedHyperparam\r\n- Uniform\r\n- RandInt\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\ntry to auto import distributions and you will find two versions. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis was never asked for to be in Neuraxle and was part of #380. The goal of #380 was to be able to do: \r\n```python \r\nhyperparams_space = HyperparamsSpace({\r\n    'some_hp_dist_neuraxle' = RandInt(1, 2),\r\n    'some_hp_dist_scipy' = scipy.randint(1, 2)\r\n}]\r\n```\r\nBut instead the scipy distributions were implemented like Neuraxle distributions in addition to building the wrapper of the scipy distributions. \r\n\r\n**Suggested Fix**\r\nDelete all of the distributions in Neuraxle that are already in Neuraxle format to remove duplicates.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
