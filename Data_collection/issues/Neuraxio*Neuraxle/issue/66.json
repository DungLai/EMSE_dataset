For example, it seems to me that all those classes could use the same \"apply\" logic and thus avoid duplicating code as is done currently: get_hyperparams, set_hyperparams, get_hyperparams_space, set_hyperparams_space, setup, teardown, and so forth. We might want to think of pipelines as trees in which we can apply functions. I'd like to validate this idea.
