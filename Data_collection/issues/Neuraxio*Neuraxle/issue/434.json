You should notice the 5 following seeds causing failing tests : 11, 23, 24, 45, 84\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDistribution should be stable.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Are 50000k samples sufficient for a stable distribution? It seems to be enough for the other distributions but maybe LogNormal requires more.\r\n- Issue #429 may be linked.\r\n- I tried 100 seeds with test_lognormal_clipped and no similar problem occurs.","closed_by":{"login":"vincent-antaki","id":74119210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTE5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74119210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-antaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
