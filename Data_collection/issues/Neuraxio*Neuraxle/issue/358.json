the bug**\r\nIt is expected of transformers that they be completely unaware that fitting exists. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nIt is seen that a transformer may know that the `fit` method exists in this universe somewhere. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`hasattr(BaseTransformer(), \"fit\") == False`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nPipelines and other classes should test for this: `if isinstance(step, _TransformerStep): skip fit;`. \r\n\r\nOther solution: otherwise wrap the transformers by a kind of `class BlockFitWrapper(NonFittableMixin, MetaStep)` what would wrap the steps upon construction in the pipeline's constructor when `isinstance(step, _TransformerStep)` for any given step. \r\n\r\nThis is in the goal to make `BaseTransformer` lightweight. Right now the `_TransformerStep` mixin implements too much things that should not be there. \r\n\r\nAlso: make the `WithContext` wrapper inherit from BaseStep and not from BaseTransformer as it will need to fit.
