Please describe.**\r\nAs the context acts like a stack of function calls with each level having its own \"variables\"-like saving in the context (e.g.: Memory (as per #443 ), it might be good that if adding a service at the middle of the pipeline, that the service is scoped and local to just this `context.push`ed level (like a programming language stack / Assembly CPU Stack that is cleared upon stack push). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen pushing and popping to context, use a recursive context data structure instead of lists of parents and a single service dict. This was done originally in the first releases of Neuraxle ever, but that was change for some reasons I don't know. It seems that the original intuition was possibly better. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSingly-linked list (stack data structure / design pattern) for the context's parents, and services. Could set global v.s. local services as well (like programming languages' global v.s. local scopes when declaring/using variables). \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
