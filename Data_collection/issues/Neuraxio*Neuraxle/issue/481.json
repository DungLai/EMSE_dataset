However, it does not seem like the setup method is being called anywhere, except when fitting a model.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice with documentation on how the lifecycle works for inference.  For example:\r\n\r\n- am i supposed to call `setup()` manually, after load? If so,\r\n    - how do i recursively setup a pipeline without implementing it myself? \r\n    - is setup supposed to be run on a loaded state? this requires care, as one could easily overwrite lodaded state in setup. this should be documented.\r\n\r\n- am i supposed to run `setup()` before load?\r\n    - this seems unlikely looking at the flowchart\r\n    - does not work with the 'load()' method in `ExecutionContext` which returns a new instance\r\n\r\n- am i supposed to not run `setup()` before inference?\r\n   - im suspecting this is the idea\r\n   - it would be nice with documentation on this, with an example.  It has implications on how both saving, loading and setup needs to be written. \r\n   - i cant make sense of the flowchart if this is the case.\r\n \r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
