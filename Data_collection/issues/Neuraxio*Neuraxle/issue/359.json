The `BlockFitWrapper` itself wouldn't be a MetaStep, as a MetaStep would imply that it could fit AND have savers AND have the `.wrapped` stripped at saving with the special meta saver. Thus, a BlockFitWrapper would be saved with its wrapped transformers unstripped (NOT stripped). \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: We probably still need the Transformers to have savers. This implies that there could be a new class like `BaseLightweightTransformer` which wouldn't have the savers to still allow regular transformers to save and to define savers. \r\n\r\nThis is just an idea, to validate.
