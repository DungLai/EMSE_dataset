To do so, from object names, we'd need an object store to save the objects to upon creating them, including custom objects.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nBaseStep to register objects to the global store using a descriptor. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe \"Pattern: language integrated registration\" of the article found below as well.
