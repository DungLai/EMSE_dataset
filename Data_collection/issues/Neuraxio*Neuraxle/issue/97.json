I think we also need a Flatten3Dto2DForEachDataInputs which is the same concept as a ForEachDataInputs but that reduces a dimension instead of manually looping on it. \r\n\r\nExample: instead of looping on the data like `for di in data_inputs: self.wrapped.transform(di);`, the Flatten3Dto2DForEachDataInputs step instead does that: \r\n```\r\nreduced_data_inputs = sum(list(data_inputs), [])  # converts data inputs from 3D to 2D. \r\nouts = self.wrapped.transform(reduced_data_inputs)\r\n\r\n# bear with me: the following is like doing: out.reshape(len(data_inputs), outs.shape[0]/len(data_inputs), *outs.shape[1:]...)\r\n# but we can't call `.shape` nor `.reshape` because the data type might not be a np.array or might not be a list, we want to keep things generic. \r\nreshaped_outs_to_reaugmented = self._re_augment_data(outs)  \r\n\r\nreturn reshaped_outs_to_reaugmented\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: what `self._re_augment_data` is to re-create the missing dimension SUCH THAT THE ARRAY THAT WE RETURN has the same number of dimensions that the data inputs had.
