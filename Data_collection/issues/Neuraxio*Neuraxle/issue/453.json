Please describe.**\r\nIn certain applications, we may have mix-types data input (e,g, a mix of categorical and real data) which may even come from different source. We need to have an efficient way to differentiate them and apply different preprocessing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some transformations may be conditional on hyperparameters. This imply that our feature vector may vary of size depending of hp and thus a user should, as much as possible, avoid to hardcode values that represents feature indexes or feature vector length. From this arise the needs to track individual feature through transformations. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI believe a good way to handle this would be a DataDescription object or something of the like within the DataContainer (or the Context?). This DataDescription object would contain, for every feature, a reference to its type, source and a name. This object would be accessible to every step along the way and would evolve with every transformation applied.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n    - Manipulation of a DataDescription may introduce a computation overhead if many transformation are applied, thus its usage should not be automatic. Because of this I think it should either be a service within the context or a special type of DataContainer.\r\n    - Steps that transform the data may need to implement some extra processing to update the DataDescription object with its transformation. This, again, should only be required if a user choose to use the DataDescription service.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm opened to alternative suggestion. My suggestions feels like it would be a heavy modification. I remember having a conversation with @guillaume-chevalier on this a while ago but I couldn't find any issue that covers it.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
