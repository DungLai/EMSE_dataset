Please describe.**\r\nWe need one documentation notebook that talks of saving and of the reasons why we need to do it like that with `create_model`, `create_loss` and `create_optimizer`. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n1. Create `gallery example` of a very simple `tf.nn.Dense` in `create_model` (linear regression) with MSE loss for fitting on the boston housing dataset [just like here](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/sklearn/plot_boston_housing_meta_optimization.html#sphx-glr-examples-sklearn-plot-boston-housing-meta-optimization-py) but with a simpler pipeline and using xle-tf. \r\n2. A documentation page (notebook-like) that could be similar to [this page](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/step_saving_and_lifecycle.html) for instance (not an example gallery). This page would also explain and state the conditions for this to work, similarly to the list of 4 conditions to respect in #406 to make sure that the reader understand how it works and what are the requisites. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPointing people to this page instead, but it is both too complicated and almost outdated: https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe documentation page could also point to the famous seq2seq example linked just above for people who'd like more info. The seq2seq notebook example could also be refactored into a **gallery example** and with a link to the original page in the code for readers to have an easier reading of the code. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
