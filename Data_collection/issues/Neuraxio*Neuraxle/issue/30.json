Example: \r\n`X_subset, Y_subset = Autoregress().transform(X)`\r\n\r\nWe could perhaps have a Mixin class that is an `OutputTransformerMixin`. The PipelineRunner, upon seeing this class, would know that the class changes the X and the Y at the same time. E.g.: \r\n```\r\nif isinstance(step, OutputTransformerMixin): \r\n    X, y = step.transform(X, y)\r\n```\r\nThis is to be done within the transform loop and the fit_transform loop. So for example, a fit transform would be unpackeable this: \r\n```\r\nif isinstance(step, OutputTransformerMixin): \r\n    step, (X, y) = step.fit_transform(X, y)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
