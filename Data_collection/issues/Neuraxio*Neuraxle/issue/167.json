Goal: try to compile the documentation upon opening a pull request such that we never merge PRs that breaks the documentation. \r\n- Problem: the documentation site is private. \r\n- Solution: This means we need to setup secret keys in the GitHub action workflow like the last answer by `OldhamMade` here: https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Best-way-to-clone-a-private-repo-during-script-run-of-private/td-p/20221\r\n\r\nThis way our github actions will be able to recursively clone the documentation repo and try to run its `build.sh` file (but with the good Neuraxle remote branch we try to merge), and it will exit on error. \r\n\r\nIdea: also code an action to redeploy the documentation website upon a merge to master if the documentation site can compile properly. The documentation website's hosting repo is also private.
