solution: delete the implementation of those methods and implement an apply method instead: \r\n- get_hyperparams\r\n- get_hyperparams_space\r\n- set_hyperparams\r\n- set_hyperparams_space\r\n- set_train\r\n- and other similar methods that are recursive and that may return a dict\r\n\r\nNote: we may need to edit the apply method's signature to add other functions to merge results in a special way (e.g.: return results as raw dicts, or as HyperparameterSamples type, or as HyperparameterDistributions type, or as lists or no result?) and to have more freedom in the way we apply things to adapt for every use case. \r\n\r\nThis will simplify the code a lot throughout the whole framework. \r\n\r\n@alexbrillant Let's do a first PR just for the StepCloner, then another one for the MetaStepMixin and TruncableStep in only a second PR (to avoid big PRs). \r\n\r\nPriority: in 2 weeks or so.
