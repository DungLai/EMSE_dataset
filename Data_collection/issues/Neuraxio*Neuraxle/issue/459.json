It could be useful to measure metrics before the first epoch as to gain better insight on the training process.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n - not every pipeline are able to transform before performing a fit. We therefore need to be able to tell the responsible instance (AutoML, Trainer or MetricCallback) whether to perform it or not\r\n - we might want the ability to perform this for some metrics and not for others.\r\n - the TrialMetricPlottingObserver should have access to this information, as to produce the right plot.\r\n - Running the whole callback list before the first epoch might not be desirable/possible; we might need to distinguish between MetricCallback and other callbacks.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
