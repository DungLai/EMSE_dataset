This functions calls each steps setup function. However, there are cases in some of our projects for which the setup has to be called at a precise moment during the pipeline execution. \r\n\r\nI believe we should get rid of the requirement to have steps initialized to be saved. However, this modification also requires the following:\r\n- We need to be able to distinguish between savers which can and can't be applied when a step isn't initialized (with a mixin?). Alternatively expect every saver to handle the case where the step is not initialized\r\n- the should_save method should be adapted accordingly.\r\n- When full_dump=True, we should not initialize steps.\r\n\r\nDo you see something I am missing @guillaume-chevalier?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
