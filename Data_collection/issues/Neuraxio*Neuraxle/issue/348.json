Please describe.**\r\nAdd a mixin that can add a different hashing behavior for the summary id. Steps that are sequential should hash summary id sequentially, but in other cases we might need to not rehash the summary id. This will be useful if we want to save checkpoints using the apply method. This might be useful to resolve the issue with the step checkpoint hashing : https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/347\r\n\r\nWe might want to use apply methods for saving.
