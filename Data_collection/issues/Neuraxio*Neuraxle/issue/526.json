In libraries like [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py#L1215) it is possible to have additional arguments being passed to the fit method. This could be things like validation generators if the main data_inputs is a data generator as well.\r\n\r\nThis means if we want to wrap a keras model that takes two data generators, in a subclass of BaseStep, then it wouldnt be a straight forward implementation.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIt would be extremely useful if an additional **kwargs is added to the base step fit method(in one or more of the Mixin classes) to enable passing arbitrary arguments to the custom estimator implementations.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
