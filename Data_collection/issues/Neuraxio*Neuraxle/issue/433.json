the bug**\r\nApply call made on AutoML instances do not reach steps contained within the pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAutoML should transmit apply calls to its children (i.e. the main pipeline)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis bug happens because AutoML does not implement the _hasChildrenMixin interface and thus uses the basic apply() function instead of the recursive one.\r\n\r\nI'll fix this in my next PR.","closed_by":{"login":"vincent-antaki","id":74119210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTE5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74119210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-antaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
