Please describe.**\r\nI want to be able, when seeing results in the hyperparameter_repository after an AutoML run that contained many trials, to see all the things that were printed during those trials. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to see in the JSON Hyperparam repo an entry in the saved JSON where the output of the training and testing is reported. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Maybe just capture \"all\" the print output instead of using a logger? this is a cheaper solution but I don't know if it's possible or if it's clean. Not sure. \r\n- Pass the instance of the logger in the context at each handle methods? this is hard as if the step needs to call the logger, it will only can do so in the handle methods and not outside of them. \r\n- Maybe use a singleton logger? This isn't the best design pattern, although it may work for this. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWould like to log during: \r\n- the calls to create_loss of the tf v2 step should be able to log\r\n- we should be able to log elsewhere such as the prints of the metrics and the prints of the epochs and training progres and so forth. \r\n\r\nIt may also be interesting to point to some charts or other output folder from the experiments.
