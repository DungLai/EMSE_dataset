For instance, if you use a TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras step within your pipeline, you’ll need to use different serializers for those steps. Overall, it’s possible to serialize a whole pipeline, by creating a subfolder tree, provided a default serializer, and the possibility for each step to define their own serializers when needed.\r\n\r\n## Data Transformation Caching\r\nIt’s possible to enable pipelines to always save and cache the data they process such that it can skip the computations and return the result directly if it sees data like this again. The whole is flexible such that you can also allow caching just for some specific steps, and by creating your own caching class, you can then use any database and cache item limit as you need.\r\n\r\n## Checkpoints\r\nCheckpoints are a way to combine both pipeline serialization and data transformation caching at once, and automatically, just by using a special pipeline type and defining where you checkpoint within the pipeline.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alexbrillant","id":19400226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDAwMjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19400226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbrillant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbrillant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
