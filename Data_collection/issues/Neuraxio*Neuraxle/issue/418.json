Please describe.**\r\nWorkers should be able to catch exceptions properly and broadcast a termination signal to all of the current workers. \r\n\r\n**First thoughts about this ?**\r\n1. Add a broadcast method to ObservableQueueMixin that sends a termination signal to all of the observers. https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/7cf9460eb2e971b32b4b84b8441d8515c9247d83/neuraxle/distributed/streaming.py#L90\r\n2.
