Scikitl-learn uses constructor arguments, which has its own problems,  but it does give a natural way of declaring hyperparameters with type and default values, which Neuraxle is missing. \r\n\r\nOne solution to this might be to use dataclasses for hyperparameters.   Dataclasses provide an ideomatic and compact way of defining data as python fields, with type information and default values built in.   Using dataclasses for parameters would make it possible to validate hyperparameters before training and give meaningful error messages on errors.  It would also make implementing models easier,  as all available hyperparameters would be available in one place. There would be no need to use string indexing, and an IDE would be able to autocomplete hyperparameter names when coding. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor context, im currently implementing an ML experimentation environment with Neuraxle as the pipeline abstraction, and with an external configuration system inspired by Spacy 3.0.   This issue comes up when trying to glue Neuraxle into a the external configuration.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
