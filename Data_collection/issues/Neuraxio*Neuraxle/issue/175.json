Neuraxle is currently at 0.2.1. The ability to plot the validation curve is something we procrastinated for too long. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: the MiniBatchSequentialPipeline could be responsible for doing this by calling `.fit` on train, then `.predict` on the validation data, then train again... and so forth. Any other ideas? I also thought of: \r\n- Doing the train/validation split at each mini-batch, inside the fit of the model, but this is very bad. \r\n- Adding 2 more arguments to fit, but this is bad. \r\n- Adding 1 more argument to transform, but this is bad and we should be using predict instead. \r\n\r\nSo the only solution to me looks like making the MiniBatchSequentialPipeline class manage that. However, how should a user tell the MiniBatchSequentialPipeline what is validation data? Would the MiniBatchSequentialPipeline instead just need a ValidationSplitWrapper (#174) and instead let the wrapper do the alternation of calling fit then predict then fit then predict again? \r\n\r\nThank you and Best Regards, \r\nGuillaume\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/175/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
