Please describe.**\r\nRe-hashing and checkpointing mechanisms are not fully working, especially with minibatches and complex pipelines, and this makes checkpointing not really usable in big/complex pipelines except for value-based checkpoints. If checkpoints are unusable, the need for current_ids and summary_ids that are rehashed is then just some bloat that we keep supporting in hope of one day using it. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCompletely remove current semi-broken checkpoint mechanisms to redo it with better design patterns. Idea: \r\n- Use repositories registered in context for such caching. Could make use of predefined context repos with a base one provided, like the InMemoryHPRepo. \r\n- Use Hooks ( #320 ) to register hashers and checkpointers, or do it in the context's push/pop at each transition \r\n- Have a class that highjacks a pipeline and do the proper hooking after the pipeline is created, injecting the wanted behavior. \r\n- remove current_ids and summary_ids ( https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/453 ) and replace them with another way to manage data. Could involve replacing DataContainers with something else completely.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nFixing what's in place. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCould use hooks at each _will_process and/or _did_process to add the re-hashing, which would be done if needed. \r\n\r\n- To anyone who intends to fix this, please read this: https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html \r\n- ![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost/cruft-impact.png)","closed_by":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
