If you want to avoid overwriting behaviour on a setup call, all you need to do is add a condition over self.is_initialized before the sensitive block of code.\r\n- All steps that have childrens (MetaSteps and TruncableSteps) are supposed to recursively call setup on their children, with the notable exception of Pipeline instances.\r\n- Pipeline instances are a special case of setup, where the call to setup its children is delayed right before the fit call is performed on its children. This is important for steps that can't be setup right away (e.g. some intermediate value needs to be computed in a previous setup method is called).\r\n- In case Pipeline is not the root of your ML pipeline, then calling setup manually (or adding a call to it in your fit function) is expected. Regardless, setup will be called on fit when a Pipeline instance is reached.\r\n- In the current setup of saving and loading, all steps are supposed to have setup called before saving. In case self.is_initialized is False (i.e. the setup method has not been called) for a given step of the pipeline at the moment of saving, a call to the setup method will be forced. Note that this may change at some point, as we intend that self.is_initialized==true will no longer be required to save a step thus allowing save even if the pipeline hasn't had a fit call yet (see #470).\r\n\r\nside note : I think the flowchart may be getting old a bit.\r\n\r\nSpecifically with regards to your 3 options, the third one is the intended usage. It is expected that setup is only called through pipeline fit calls. From there, here are a couple of options you have :\r\n\r\n- You could write a custom Saver (see [BaseSaver](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/167d2e741a233a6019f6f89767d0cfd08cd0ff72/neuraxle/base.py#L191)) for your step that needs setupping after load.\r\n- You could add a call to setup in your transform function.\r\n- You could use a apply call (e.g. pipeline.apply('setup', context=context)) to force call setup on all on every steps in the pipeline. I'd recommend avoiding this option though as a step's setup function might be called multiple time (once through the apply, and multiple other time through its parents apply calls).\r\n\r\nOverall, I agree with you that setup is poorly documented and might need to be revisited eventually.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask more questions if you have any, I'll be glad to help you. Cheers!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/833742273/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vincent-antaki","id":74119210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTE5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74119210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-antaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/833895137","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/481#issuecomment-833895137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/481","id":833895137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzg5NTEzNw==","user":{"login":"joel-odlund","id":3356505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTY1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3356505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-odlund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T21:54:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T21:54:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you. This brings some clarity, i will try out some of these ideas.\r\nsome questions come to mind, that might be useful if you decide to revisit the documentation. \r\n\r\n- if setup is only done when fitting, why is setup needed at all?  why not initialize things as part of fit?\r\n- if setup is not intended to to be run after load,  does it mean that all heavy state, such as word vectors, are intended to be serialized in the pipeline and then loaded back again?  This has some implications when training many models and duplicating data that could otherwise be shared. it also implies some code duplication between load and setup which could be annoying.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice alternatives you give for when and how to use the setup method. I do think however that its imprtant for Neuraxle and its wider adoption that there is one idomatic way of doing it, which is well understood and documented.   For example,  my  current task is to use Neuraxle to implement a general purpose ML environment. Most individual components will not be written by me, but by others on the team that may not have intimate knowledge of Neuraxle, and there will be expectations on clear instructions on how to do things, and why.    \r\n\r\nI really think Neuraxle is something the community needs, thats why im bringing up these things.

When spending all day using the framework, we can sometime lose sight of how other users would approach the various concepts and abstractions (Well, I don't know about @guillaume-chevalier, but that's more than certainly my case). The framework is in constant evolution and sometime its development is tailored to what specific project we have; this may lead us to have blind spot, or at least a biased priority queue. Comments like yours are essential for us to keep a healthy list of what needs to be done, both in term of documentation and code.\r\n\r\nFor your first question, it first and foremost a question of proper function encapsulation. setup is called **before** fit and doesn't achieve the same purpose. Furthermore, I think setup used to be called after load, and that behaviour was changed throughout a project a while ago. I think Guillaume may have more information on that specific design choice. \r\n\r\nAs for your second question, we don't expect users to serialize heavy stuff. Usually, we recommend that heavy and/or shared stuff be handled through the ExecutionContext's services. This is another part of the code which might not be well explained yet as it is fairly recent. I'll refer you to the [code](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/master/neuraxle/base.py#L393) since it's rather straightforward, but once again, feel free to ask question if you have

@joel-odlund! \r\n\r\nI brought up some questions to Guillaume about the design choices for the setup function and we've concluded that we'll be revisiting it for the next release (0.5.8). Things will differ quite a bit from what I've told you so far although it will not change anything with regards to the save/load aspect of your initial question.\r\n\r\nThis will be the expected behaviour for setup after the modifications:\r\n - There will be no recurrent setup calls.\r\n - Setup calls will be removed from pipeline fit calls.\r\n - Setup calls will be added as the first step of all handler functions execution (handle_fit, handle_fit_transform, handle_transform).\r\n - The setup calls will be conditional on the self.is_initialized attribute. Thus setup are expected to be executed only once. Coding overwriting behaviour as part of setup should therefore not be problematic.\r\n\r\nDocumentation will be changed accordingly. Please do not hesitate to give me your thoughts about that change if you feel like
