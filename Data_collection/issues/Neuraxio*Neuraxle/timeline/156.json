My remarks were related to the amount \nof code needed to move from existing code\nTo Neuraxle.\nLess code needed is better for quick conversion and maintenance.\n\nHow do you make difference with

them.\n \n  I suggest you to write some example of typical pipeline use case : (as drawing image)\n    pandas + sklearn  (ok \n    pandas + xgboost  (nok)\n    Dask + Tensorflow ....\n     PySpark +
