Also, [here](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/f560f21/neuraxle/union.py#L29) is the exact line of code for example. There is parallel processing in the Neuraxle feature union with joblib. \r\n\r\nIf you want to treat different data types in your columns, you can use scikit-learn's [ColumnTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html), wrapped with a [SKLearnWrapper](https://www.neuraxle.neuraxio.com/stable/api/neuraxle.steps.sklearn.html#neuraxle.steps.sklearn.SKLearnWrapper), such as calling `SKLearnWrapper(ColumnTransformer(...))` in your pipeline. \r\n\r\nIf you need more flexibility, you can inherit from the `BaseStep` class found in the `neuraxle.base` module and define your own transformation in your inherited and re-defined `.transform(...)` method.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute and add more features to Neuraxle, we always love to see new contributors!
