Rohith,\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution isn't ideal, mostly because we save the trial json multiple time during training (at each epoch usually). I personally advocate for the two following solutions: \r\n - Setting an arbitrary hash as trial id when generating a new trial (and not have them be dependent on hyperparameters)\r\n - Having a lock on save_trial and load_all_trial on hyperparamsJSONRepository \r\n\r\nNot having the hash be dependent on the hyperparameters would also save us a headache or two when dealing with issue #496 and #504. Furthermore, it would allow us to solve the problem where the logger currently uses the trial number to generate the log file path instead of the trial hash (I though there was an opened issue related to this but I can't find it).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/880835725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vincent-antaki","id":74119210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTE5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74119210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki","html_url":"https://github.com/vincent-antaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincent-antaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":5709145569,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCpoNY8415AjBzwAAAAFUSqXh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/events/5709145569","actor":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d1c4bcdea0f4d398641df38422fbcdf45c1ba08b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kimoby/Neuraxle/commits/d1c4bcdea0f4d398641df38422fbcdf45c1ba08b","created_at":"2021-12-02T23:59:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6338967512,"node_id":"CE_lADOCpoNY8415AjBzwAAAAF51PfY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/events/6338967512","actor":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d1c4bcdea0f4d398641df38422fbcdf45c1ba08b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/commits/d1c4bcdea0f4d398641df38422fbcdf45c1ba08b","created_at":"2022-03-30T23:13:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
