\r\n\r\n> How do we handle hyperparameter space / rvs for shared hyperparameter? We probably want context to implement _HasHyperparams and _HasHyperparametersSpace. I feel like this take us one step closer to the context being some kind of ultimate-all-encompassing-meta-step and I'm not sure I like it.\r\n\r\nI just had an idea reading this: the context could hold some BaseTransformers (but not base steps). Thinking of the FeatureAggregation, I see that we would like some contextual steps in the services ! \r\n\r\nThe context has a lot of feature envy from the transformers, and we already see it. Instead of coding new logic in the services dict, the context could be a TruncableStep with its own dict keys as names of contained steps, and dict values as the steps in question. One of this step could be a SharedHyperparameterBank. That wouldn't even be a BaseTransformer in fact... that would be a class with some hyperparams, a space, and apply methods. \r\n\r\nThis makes me feel that there is one more class between a BaseTransformer and its mixins that we could probably extract and use here. \r\n\r\nSide note: a Truncable Step is too much for the context to inherit from. We want less maybe. That is perhaps a sign that the TruncableStep could be splitted furthermore into different mixins using the interface segregation principle to split the dict behavior appart (and the apply logic as well). That would be like an _IndexableStepMixin or something like that... perhaps?\r\n\r\n> How do we indicate to a step that it should fetch the required hyperparams in the shared hyperparam bank (i.e. the context)? I'd like to avoid re-coding a step to have a regular and a shared hyperparam version. (see alternative for a potential solution to this)\r\n\r\nYes, perhaps we could have a SharedHyperparamDistribution(\"name\") class in the distributions and in the spaces classes that would contain only a string. Upon getting this class, the getter for the hyperparam and hyperparam space would know to retrieve it from the passed context's special hyperparam class. However, this would risk making the apply logic quite convoluted for the getters and setters. The exception we'd do at the level 0 of the applies for the context is already a lot for an exception. I would like to compare more solutions before picking the definitive one. I think we're on something.

not sure I see what's the point of having the context implement such TruncableStep-like interface.
