again.  \r\n\r\n- _\"cannot be validated by an IDE, or by an external configuration system\": could you please give an idea of static validation of hyperparameters? Is that why dataclasses would be useful, so as to not forget to add some params?_   Yes,  it would be helpful to have a static check that hyperparameters are complete and of correct type.   For example, if some hyperparam is used late in the training code, or if the training is executed elsewhere, perhaps on a queue, it would take a long time to catch a missing parameter or a spelling error.   Dataclasses, or some other typed construct, would make it possible to catch these bugs early. \r\n\r\n- _\"validate hyperparameters before training\": interesting idea! Like the global assertion wrappers we have._   Yes, that would be nice.  Ideally it would be supported by design, and not require any explicit assertions by the user.  \r\n\r\n- _\"possibly using dataclasses for hyperparameters\": I feel this may become heavy. I would prefer a custom solution where the HasHyperparamsMixin could allow the class to define its own hyperparameter requirements as well as the assertion wrapper._ I agree that dataclasses is somewhat heavy.  In particular, it requires you to create a class with a name, and somehow associate it with the step.  However, it allows you to compactly representing all hyperparams, with names, types and default values in a compact way, and checks could be implemented  by the framework and not by the user.   Im not sure what you have in mind for an assertion wrapper, but i do believe that asserting values / types could be done on a language level rather than on the pipeline level (ie by using typed values).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- _\"It would also make implementing models easier, as all available hyperparameters would be available in one place\": please note that this is possible with the getters and setters right now, such as pipeline.get_hyperparams().to_flat_dict() or something like this_ Yes. I was referring to readability of the code when developing models and pipelines,  not at runtime.  \r\n\r\n- _\"There would be no need to use string indexing\": could you elaborate more on why it would be like this? I'm not sure to understand._  A toy example:\r\nwe use string indexing to access params in a dict\r\n```python\r\nmy_value = 1/self.params['alpha']\r\n```\r\nIf `params` is a dataclass,   the params are fields\r\n```python\r\nmy_value = 1/self.params.alpha\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere an IDE would autocomplete values, catch errors etc. \r\n\r\n_I would be curious to know what is your \"external configuration system inspired by Spacy 3.0\"._\r\n\r\n\r\nIm working in an NLP team and im working on a way to manage training and experimentation in an organized way. One thing that makes sense to me is to separate the implementation of models , components and pipelines from their particular configurations (ie hyperparameters).  So we want to train a large number of versions of the same pipeline, with different parameters,  without writing new code for each instace.  Hence,  we want an external configuration system.\r\n   While working on this, Spacy released 3.0, with the main feature being an external configuration system.   It is both compact and expressive, which is nice.  It supports parameter validation by using function parameters.  An annotated function creates your component, and parameters are represented as parameters to this function.  I dont agree with this solution entirely, as it ties hyperparameters ti instantiation, much like scikitlearn.  Spacy does not support hyperparameter optimization, which is where this design becomes problematic.\r\n\r\nWe are not ready to commit to Spacy as our framework, as it is not general enough, does not support hyperparam search, and we have non-nlp use cases. but we are borrowing the configuration system and combining it with neuraxle, to get the best of both worlds.  I think a good config system is essential, and maybe adding one to Neuraxle could be a great thing!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/833014798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joel-odlund","id":3356505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTY1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3356505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-odlund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-odlund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/834786587","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/478#issuecomment-834786587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/478","id":834786587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNDc4NjU4Nw==","user":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-07T21:17:46Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T21:17:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@joel-odlund thanks for your answer!
