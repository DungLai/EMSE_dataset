Every transformation is a class ?\r\n\r\nYes, exactly like in scikit-learn. The transformations can also define a `fit` method before the `transform` method to learn from the data before doing the transformation. Here in the example of the `FillNAValues`, we inherit from also `NonFittableMixin` which removes the requirement of defining a `fit` method. For instance, a normalizer that would act by fitting a mean and a variance (std) would first need to fit before transforming the data. \r\n\r\nThe `TruncatedSVD` is also a class that can fit and then can transform. Scikit-learn works like that. \r\n\r\nNeuraxle is a library for machine learning pipelines, and it is assumed that people can fit anything before transforming data. Some things can fit many times in a row for online learning for instance, which is an improvement over scikit-learn.
