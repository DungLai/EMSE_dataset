This means that the higher order steps would have no special state, no saver of their own, and would be saved by the default saver of their parents (that necessarily are one of a: MetaStep, TruncableStep, or a root). This allows for not having to name them in the saving tree, and it also allows for these steps to not have any apply functions, nor hyperparams, nor anything too funky. So the ghost higher order steps would be very very light, not even a BaseTransformer. It would inherit only some of the core mixins. \r\n\r\nHowever, as a downside, it complexifies the saving of the MetaStep, TruncableStep, or nothingness (root) that contains them. One solution for the root thing is to always wrap everything that is saved within an IdentityWrapper when .save is called, at the root level. \r\n\r\n@vincent-antaki
