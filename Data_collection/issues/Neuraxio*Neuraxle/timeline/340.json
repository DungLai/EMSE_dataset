Yellowbrick seems nice. \r\n\r\nQuick response: \r\n1. We won't inherit from `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` directly. You can however use `.tosklearn()` on any Neuraxle step or pipeline class and it will inherit from the BaseEstimator as you wanted: https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/1425d584817fa6b03ee303ae8815bb7e45418cb7/neuraxle/base.py#L1656\r\n2. For the `score` method, it was a design choice to make the pipelines completely independent from the way they are scored. After analysis, we realized that the software is more flexible when scoring isn't tied to the pipeline nor models. You could create your own wrapper like we did for making scikit-learn classes compatible with Neuraxle using a dynamic parser of sklearn steps. See this code here: https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/1425d584817fa6b03ee303ae8815bb7e45418cb7/neuraxle/base.py#L2375 that is executed at the creation of every pipeline to parse the steps it contains, and also this other method here: https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/1425d584817fa6b03ee303ae8815bb7e45418cb7/neuraxle/base.py#L1734 to learn how we did. You could do the same to adapt Neuraxle steps to Yellowbrick. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nTo sum up: \r\n\r\nI see a quick solution in your code that could solve these two issues: create a NeuraxleWrapper that would wrap the Neuraxle step, just like our SKLearnWrapper https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/blob/1425d584817fa6b03ee303ae8815bb7e45418cb7/neuraxle/steps/sklearn.py#L39 used by the code above at point 2.
