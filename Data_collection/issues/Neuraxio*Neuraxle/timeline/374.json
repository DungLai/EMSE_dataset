Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nYes, there is an example here : https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/caching/plot_auto_ml_checkpoint.html\r\nThe step saving checkpoints had problems, and they have been fixed here : #377 I am waiting for my boss to approve the pull request : @guillaume-chevalier \r\n\r\nNext release will have this fix that includes the step saving checkpoint. Thanks for trying out Neuraxle :)
