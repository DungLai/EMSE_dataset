I agree just defining Bernouili = Boolean would be sufficient. I mentionned that change because I initialy CTRL-F through that file writing Bernouilli and did not find it. Anyway, different people different intuition, I see no problem to have both.\r\n\r\nAs for defining Binomial(n,p) as a Choice, I think it's a straightforward way to do it. Requires a bit more computation on initialisation but its faster than simulating the whole thing each time you sample. Wrapping scipy.stats.binom is another alternative we could consider. Anyway, I don't have strong feeling on it one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIn my specific case, I was only looking for a Bernouilli. However, I could imagine a case where we'd be want to use a Binomial distribution instead of a RandInt in a random hyperparameter search.\r\n\r\nAlso, side question, lets say that, for my random hyperparameter search, I'd really like to use learning_rate = 10**uniform(-2,-4). That doesn't seem to be an option within the current state of the framework; I'd have to create my own class ExpUniform. Would there be a not too complex way to introduce operator on these distributions instead? Or even if a complex option is on the table, are any attempt at doing this fundamentally overkill and computationally wasteful for the conceptual scope of the distributions in this

you are refining to with `10**uniform(-2,-4)` is in fact a logUniform (with base 10) distribution. Neuraxle currently have a logUniform but using a base 2 which means `2**uniform(a, b)`. I think you can easily convert the 10**uniform(-2, 4) to one using a base 2 since` 10 = 2**(log(10) / log(2))`. It will gives something like `2** uniform(-2*3.32192, -4 * 3.32192)` .

changing the numerical stability of the sampling, which is why I've used the base 2 as float numbers like to bitshifft easily with mults or divs with 2 without much change to the actual number being shifted. \r\n\r\nSide note: see issue https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/429 that I've just created related to the LogUniform and LogNormal distributions.

: Your right, putting it in base 2 or base 10 will still give something uniform. The only thing it matters is how you parametrize the logUniform. If the user things 10**(a1) and 10**(b1) the value for a and b will be different for 2**(a2) and 2**(b2). So a1 !=a2 and b1!=b2. But since we do\r\n\r\nself.log2_min_included = math.log2(min_included)\r\nself.log2_max_included = math.log2(max_included)\r\n\r\nAnd we use these value in the RVS, I agree with you that it changes nothing. The user do not directly put the value a1/b1 or a2/b2 but min = 2**(log2_min_included) and max= (2**log2_max_included) and here log2_min_include = a2 and log2_max_included = b2. Since we parametrize like that the LogUniform I agree with you that it changes nothing and it changes nothing because we are uniform in the log space. On the LogNormal, it might be the same thing also because we input the log2_mean and not the mean directly and the same thing for the scale. So the way we parametrize it, I think we are independant of the scale as you mention. But if you use scipy stats which are parametrized differently, you have to parametrize it accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/750660664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Eric2Hamel","id":50344651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzQ0NjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50344651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric2Hamel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric2Hamel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4145891317,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE0NTg5MTMxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/events/4145891317","actor":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-24T00:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4145891319,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxNDU4OTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/events/4145891319","actor":{"login":"guillaume-chevalier","id":11862328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYyMzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11862328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaume-chevalier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-24T00:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/comments/1166775507","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/428#issuecomment-1166775507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Neuraxio/Neuraxle/issues/428","id":1166775507,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCpoNY85Fi5TT","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","re
