I think so. If not, we could perhaps use `numpy.stack`. \r\n\r\nComment: I don't like numpy's `column_*` nor `hstack` nor `vstack` methods. I strongly prefer using `np.concatenate` and specifying the axis, which is clearly understandeable without having to memorize the full numpy API for the equivalent methods that uses dimensions 0 and 1.
