You need to use Neuraxle's RandomSearch instead of sklearn's random search for this to work. Use Neuraxle's base classes when possible (e.g.: use the Neuraxle Pipeline instead of the sklearn pipeline if applicable). \r\n2. Make sure that you use a Neuraxle BaseStep for your pytorch model, instead of a sklearn base classe. \r\n3. Also, you should create your PyTorch code only in the setup() method or later. You can't create a PyTorch model in the `__init__` of the BaseStep that contains pytorch code. You will want to read [this page](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/step_saving_and_lifecycle.html). \r\n4. You will probably have to create a [`Saver`](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/api/neuraxle.base.html?highlight=BaseSaver#neuraxle.base.BaseSaver) for your BaseStep that contains PyTorch code if you want to serialize and then load your trained pipeline again. You can see how we created our [TensorFlow Saver](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle-TensorFlow/blob/master/neuraxle_tensorflow/tensorflow_v2.py#L167) for our [TensorFlow BaseStep](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle-TensorFlow/blob/de6f857b5be326e32e3e5a181d9320056624b2f3/neuraxle_tensorflow/tensorflow_v2.py#L27) and do something similar. Your saver will probably be much simpler than ours due to the more eager nature of PyTorch. For instance, you could have self.model inside your extension of the BaseStep class. The role of the saver would be to save and strip away this simple variable from self, and to be able to reload it whenever needed. \r\n\r\nYou could then also even use the AutoML class ([see AutoML example here](https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/examples/auto_ml/plot_automl_loop_clean_kata.html#sphx-glr-examples-auto-ml-plot-automl-loop-clean-kata-py)) to save experiments in a Hyperparameter Repository as seen in the example.
