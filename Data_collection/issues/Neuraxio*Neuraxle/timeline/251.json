We rather take `self.wrapped` and then set inside him the best hyperparameters we've found, and it isn't retrained. \r\n\r\nMoreover, we should probably do the deepcopy of the `self.wrapped` at the line `auto_ml_algorithm: AutoMLAlgorithm = self.wrapped` rather than at the line `return copy.deepcopy(auto_ml_algorithm)` but I'm not sure. \r\n\r\nThe deepcopy might not even be needed if the return
