In this case, noise is being generated artificially, due to the lack of real images to form the dataset. You do not need the clean image for this to work, it's used with loads of low exposure photographs of the same object (i.e. space photography) and the underlying explanation of why does this work is that on average the pixels are correctly captured instead of the noise. Put it simply, in some cases it's cheaper (and in medical situations, less risky for the subject) to take multiple noisy images than one single noise-free image. The research is good if you understand it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/481597651/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"victorca25","id":41912303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTEyMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41912303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25","html_url":"https://github.com/victorca25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorca25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2265316015,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI2NTMxNjAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/2265316015","actor":{"login":"dylan-plummer","id":13262754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjYyNzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13262754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer","html_url":"https://github.com/dylan-plummer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T08:41:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2265316016,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyNjUzMTYwMTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/2265316016","actor":{"login":"dylan-plummer","id":13262754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjYyNzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13262754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer","html_url":"https://github.com/dylan-plummer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan-plummer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T08:41:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/1242963893","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/28#issuecomment-1242963893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/28","id":1242963893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCHEPB85KFh-1","user":{"login":"QiangZhangCV","id":23569533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23569533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV","html_url":"https://github.com/QiangZhangCV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiangZhangCV/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-11T13:21:34Z","updated_at":"2022-09-1
