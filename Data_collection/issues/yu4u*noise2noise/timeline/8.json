I personally normalized the images to [0,1], will try to train without any normalization.\r\n\r\nUpdate: tried training without normalizing to [0,1], still getting INF loss\r\nUpdate2: I added Batch Norm layers to the UNET and that seems to have solved the INF loss issue. Now I only need to understand why your network performs well even without Batch Norm :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/420116092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Shakarim94","id":11331415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzMxNDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11331415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94","html_url":"https://github.com/Shakarim94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1837441896,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgzNzQ0MTg5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/1837441896","actor":{"login":"yu4u","id":618466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-11T02:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1837441899,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4Mzc0NDE4OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/1837441899","actor":{"login":"yu4u","id":618466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-11T02:08:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/420476139","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/8#issuecomment-420476139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/8","id":420476139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDQ3NjEzOQ==","user":{"login":"yu4u","id":618466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T01:02:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T01:02:07Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hi,
