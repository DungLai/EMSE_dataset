However, point cloud denoising is really nice task for \"Noise2Noise approach\". The ground-truth is hard to obtain, but noisy images from underlying ground-truth can easily sampled many times (but only in a static scene).\r\nThe difficult point here is how to encode and decode point clouds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/540273745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yu4u","id":618466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
