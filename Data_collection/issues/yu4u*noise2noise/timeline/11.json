For example, the number of images required for a super resolution task is relatively small. Denoising task, the task noise2noise is going to solve, is a task similar to super resolution, thus I think the number of images required for training is not so large.\r\nAnyway, it is better to increase the training data if the performance matters. You can simply set `--image_dir` to the directory including a large number of images.\r\n\r\n> P.S. how much time does it take to train the network for gaussian noise?\r\n\r\nAbout six hours for 60 epoch training on GTX 1080.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/417326666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yu4u","id":618466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yu4u/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1818412560,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgxODQxMjU2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/1818412560","actor":{"login":"Shakarim94","id":11331415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzMxNDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11331415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94","html_url":"https://github.com/Shakarim94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-30T14:46:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1818413098,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxODE4NDEzMDk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/events/1818413098","actor":{"login":"Shakarim94","id":11331415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzMxNDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11331415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94","html_url":"https://github.com/Shakarim94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shakarim94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-30T14:46:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/comments/418145667","html_url":"https://github.com/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/11#issuecomment-418145667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/11","id":418145667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODE0NTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"shivamsaboo17","id":23507911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTA3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23507911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17","html_url":"https://github.com/shivamsaboo17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivamsaboo17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T15:28:29Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T15:28:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is
