But it is a bit unclear how this can be achieved. \r\nI am following these instructions\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19289470/adding-poisson-noise-to-an-image#\r\nThis is adding noise, but also changes the intensity of the image. Further in the paper although they say that poisson is signal dependent, they add noise with a fixed lambda = 30. To achieve this I am taking dividing  the image(0-255) with 255 and multiply it with 30 and then sampling a poisson filter and adding it to my image. Am I going in the wrong direction?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
