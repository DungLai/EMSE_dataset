I don't have much Python experience, and I tried a variety of the suggested solutions via Google, but in the end the solution was as simple as switching from multiprocessing to multithreading on Windows (due to its different fork model). You can do this simply by setting `use_multiprocessing=False` on line 95 in `train.py`.\r\n\r\nYusuke, thank you so much for sharing this wonderful repo. I'm a computer graphics programmer by trade, and I've been meaning to get my feet wet with machine learning for a while now, and your repo was the perfect gentle introduction, with applications directly to my job. Much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJaap Suter","closed_by":{"login":"JaapSuter","id":44677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter","html_url":"https://github.com/JaapSuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaapSuter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/12/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yu4u/noise2noise/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
