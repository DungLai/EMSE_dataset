They are essentially saying if you don't have the clean photo for training and have different noisy versions BASED ON the clean photo, you can get similar results. Is that not common sense??? To me first of all:\r\n\r\n1) They basically discovered the power of averaging big whoop. \r\n2) in how many real world scenarios is this actually useful?? When will you have a number of different noisy photos that happen to be based on the same CLEAN photo but with juts different distributions of noises overlaid on top of it. \r\n3) If you take a step back and use common sense, the noisy images must be generated from the SAME clean photo. So of course the information in the clean photo is already in there!! You've just artificially degraded the information on purpose, wtf is the point of that in the first place?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the claim that the intention is to train for images specific to the noise of the device, fine, that is definitely doable but exactly how much value does that add?\r\nAnd actually I even doubt if its practical cause you need to take multiple images of the exactly same \"ground truth\" for it to work, you must have a seriously crappy device if that is your intention. \r\n\r\nI know this might not be the right place to share my comments but I was seriously disappointed in this piece of research and I don't know if anyone else feels the same or if I actually missed out something important.
