The training gif is generated at the end of the training with one image for every epoch. Are you saying that this is not working on your side, or that you'd like the gif to be stored after every epoch?\r\n\r\nA quick workaround for the latter case is to change line 96-97 in `disvae/training.py` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\r\n    ....\r\nif self.gif_visualizer is not None:\r\n    self.gif_visualizer.save_reset()\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\r\n    ....\r\n    if self.gif_visualizer is not None:\r\n        self.gif_visualizer.save()\r\n\r\nif self.gif_visualizer is not None:\r\n    self.gif_visualizer.reset()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich basically saves the whole gif at every epoch. Do you want this feature in order to have the gif in case you exit the training with ctrl-c or to check how what the model is learning while training? \r\n\r\n2. Right now we have to wait until the end of training to enable visualization and evaluation. This is because we only save the metadata at the end of training (which is not necessary). Quick workaround, line 190 of `main.py` add: `save_metadata(vars(args), exp_dir)` where `save_metadata` is improted from modelIO. I.e. line 10 of `main.py` should be `from disvae.utils.modelIO import save_model, load_model, load_metadata,save_metadata`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if it works, and if others show interests in those features i'll add them in the repo.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/comments/497015535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YannDubs","id":24327668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI3NjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24327668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs","html_url":"https://github.com/YannDubs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2615794108,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYxNTc5NDEwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/events/2615794108","actor":{"login":"YannDubs","id":24327668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI3NjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24327668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs","html_url":"https://github.com/YannDubs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-06T23:02:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
