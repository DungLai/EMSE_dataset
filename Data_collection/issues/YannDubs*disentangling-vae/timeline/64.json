Indeed, I've checked by taking the first 10000 samples, which are also the first 10000 samples in mean. With the view() operation it does not return the same values as in mean (which it should since the samples are mean values). I replaced with permute and it works as expected. \r\n\r\nThus I think it should be: \r\n\r\n        samples_zCx = samples_zCx.index_select(0, samples_x).permute(1,0)\r\n        samples_zCx = samples_zCx.unsqueeze(0).expand(len_dataset, latent_dim, n_samples)\r\n\r\nin place of https://github.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/blob/7b8285baa19d591cf34c652049884aca5d8acbca/disvae/evaluate.py#L269 and https://github.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/blob/7b8285baa19d591cf34c652049884aca5d8acbca/disvae/evaluate.py#L272","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/comments/786709420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DianeBouchacourt","id":13796686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk2Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13796686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt","html_url":"https://github.com/DianeBouchacourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DianeBouchacourt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/comments/786769574","html_url":"https://github.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/64#issuecomment-786769574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/64","id":786769574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4Njc2OTU3NA==","user":{"login":"YannDubs","id":24327668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI3NjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24327668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs","html_url":"https://github.com/YannDubs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-26T17:00:24Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T17:00:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Awesome thanks Diane, a few others had open issues for that but there was no solutions (I don't actively work on that anymore).
