Is this something you were noticing in your own tests?\r\n\r\nVisual inspection of the traversals in DSprites seem to show that the network is learning quite disentangled representations (attached, with rows arranged in order of descending KL-divergence from Gaussian prior), so I am quite confused as to why the MIG score is so low. \r\n\r\nEven introducing supervision (matching latent factors to generative factors, the maximum MIG score I have been able to attain is around 0.01, but AAM is a lot higher, at around 0.6 for the model that produced the attached latent traversals.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJustin\r\n\r\n![traversals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27450488/68543181-d602a080-0407-11ea-994c-480cc477b714.png)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
