Each term is computed exactly by a closed form solution (KL between the prior and the posterior). Tightest lower bound.\r\nβ-VAEH: α=β=ɣ>1. Each term is computed exactly by a closed form solution. Simply adds a hyper-parameter (β in the paper) before the KL.\r\nβ-VAEB: α=β=ɣ>1. Same as β-VAEH but only penalizes the 3 terms once they deviate from a capacity C which increases during training.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe standard VAE is simply `gamma=1` with no `alpha` or `beta`. For Beta-VAE it is simply `gamma > 0` with again no `alpha` or `beta`. Did I miss something?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"YannDubs","id":24327668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzI3NjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24327668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs","html_url":"https://github.com/YannDubs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannDubs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
