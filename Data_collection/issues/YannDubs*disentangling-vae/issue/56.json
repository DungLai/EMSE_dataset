Thanks for this wonderful repo!\r\n\r\nMy question is, shouldn't beta be equal to 0 for the standard VAE loss (i.e. there's no correlation term)?\r\n\r\nAlso, wouldn't it be clearer to switch beta and gamma hyperparameter symbols, considering that we have literature like betaVAE which uses beta as the hyperparameter for the Dimension-wise KL Divergence?\r\n\r\nEdiy: I just found a similar question #55 .
