I was kindly wondering if you could share your PlotNeuralNet code (which is what I presume you used to generate [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae/master/doc/imgs/architecture.png)). I would really appreciate it! To my knowledge, there aren't any VAE visualization examples for this online, so I imagine it would be very helpful for others too.
