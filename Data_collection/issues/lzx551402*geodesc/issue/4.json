But as HPatches mentioned, every patch is extracted using scale invariant interest point detecotrs, such as DoG. And then every patch is normalized to 65*65 pixels.\r\n\r\nSo you extract exactly 1 descriptor on every patch? How did you do that? What if there is more than 1 descriptor generated? Or maybe no descriptor can be generated?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nWeibo Qiu.","closed_by":{"login":"lzx551402","id":8350839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTA4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8350839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402","html_url":"https://github.com/lzx551402","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
