Usually, features with larger size are easy to match, while features with smaller size are more geometrically accurate. Since the geometry accuracy can be amended in later bundle adjustment, the sampling here is performed in descent order to ease the matching.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you may consider keypoint sampling according to its detection score (e.g., the DoG score for SIFT). Such sampling strategy is useful when you want to strictly limit the keypoint number (e.g., to 2000).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/comments/520394650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lzx551402","id":8350839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTA4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8350839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402","html_url":"https://github.com/lzx551402","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzx551402/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/comments/520713394","html_url":"https://github.com/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/6#issuecomment-520713394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lzx551402/geodesc/issues/6","id":520713394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDcxMzM5NA==","user":{"login":"mqchen1993","id":28089616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDg5NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28089616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993","html_url":"https://github.com/mqchen1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqchen1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T06:56:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T06:56:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nThank you very much for your answer.
