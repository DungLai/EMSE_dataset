I was able to implement it. Yet is there a built-in function to classify data instead of looking at the graph to figure out the anomaly? (simply I want to call a python custom function when there is an anomaly).\r\n\r\nI can use a threshold value for the codisp value and call the function that I want if there is an anomaly. However, I have around 40 sensor inputs which have different data patterns. So is codisp value is a relative value to the one unique case or can I use a general threshold for this?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
