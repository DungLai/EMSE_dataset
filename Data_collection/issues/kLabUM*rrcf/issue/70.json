I have a use case that need train the rrcf using some given dataset, and then predict on unseen data samples this haven't been seen during training period. \r\n\r\nCan we use batch mode to achieve that? One simple solution I can come up with is to first insert that point to the forest, calculate the codisp, and then delete it. I am wondering is there any smarter ways to save the inference time?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
