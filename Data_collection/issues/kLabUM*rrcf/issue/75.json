I see that the project is in `MIT License` which is great. Can you also add this to `setup.py` so that it is correctly reflected in `pypi`. Many companies use the meta information available with `pypi` to understand the license of the project , so for `rrcf` it is coming as `unknown` . We just need to add one line to the `setup.py`, Could you please consider updating it. I can send a PR if you would like it that way.","closed_by":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/75/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/75/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
