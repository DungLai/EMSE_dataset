The probability of getting a tree over the two remaining points that uses a vertical separator is 3/4 − ε/2 and not 1/2 as desired\".\r\n\r\nCould anyone help me to understand this statement? It's not clear to me how these probabilities are obtained.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"adavoli91","id":64688161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Njg4MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64688161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91","html_url":"https://github.com/adavoli91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adavoli91/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
