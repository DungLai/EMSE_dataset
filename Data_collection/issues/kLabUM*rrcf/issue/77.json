When we consider streaming data, what is the intuition behind shingle_size?\r\nAt first I understand that it is kind of rolling window concept (like timestamps in LSTM). Also, I thought it would similar to frequency of the wave( for say), i.e. shingle_size=no. of data points in on period. So if I have a weekly trend, then shingle_size = 7(a week) . But this doesn't seem to be correct. Could you please put some light about how should we choose shingle_size? @mdbartos  :)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/77/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
