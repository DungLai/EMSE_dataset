I use batch-mode to train the model. Thereafter, when I insert a point that is identical to a subset of points in the training dataset, the point will displace all its existing copies. This results in a high (co)displacement-score for this point, even though the point is very common. \r\n\r\nUpdate: setting the tolerance to 0 when inserting a point did the trick.","closed_by":{"login":"alexstrid","id":112708851,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrfM8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112708851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid","html_url":"https://github.com/alexstrid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexstrid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
