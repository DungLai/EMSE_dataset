It is so useful.\r\nI have a question here. \r\n\r\nHow do we integrate this with realtime streaming data such as from mqtt server.? (e.g:mqtt server sends data every one second)\r\n\r\nIn this rccf streaming example, the generated sine wave data need to be completely generated first, then later it will be pumped into rccf for anomaly detection.\r\n\r\nMy question here is how do we implement it, if the data keep continuously generated?\r\n\r\nI am thinking of using que, or buffer that collect the data point first before it is submitted to rccf for anomaly scoring.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\ncj\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
