After following through the original streaming example I tried pickling and unpickling a single tree, but the results are not same.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nt = forest[0]\r\nwith open(\"a.pkl\", \"wb\") as f:\r\n    pickle.dump(t.to_dict(), f)\r\n\r\nt2 = rrcf.RCTree()\r\nwith open(\"a.pkl\", \"rb\") as f:\r\n    t2.load_dict(pickle.load(f))\r\n\r\nlen(t.leaves)\r\n# 257\r\n\r\nlen(t2.leaves)\r\n# 238\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought the issue is while calling `pickle.dump` as the tree dict is nested, but [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled) says it'll raise `RecursionError` if such an object is encountered. So I think the issue could be with the `to_dict` or `load_dict` functions. I used both `pickle` and `dill` to test this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
