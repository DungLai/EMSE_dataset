Can you tell me what you mean by similar? Do you mean the trees are all exactly the same?\r\n\r\nThis should not happen unless there's a bug. Even if the trees incorporate the exact same points, the structure of the trees should be different because the partitioning algorithm is randomized.\r\n\r\nSee, for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport rrcf\r\nnp.random.seed(0)\r\n\r\nX = np.random.randn(8, 3)\r\n\r\ntree_0 = rrcf.RCTree()\r\ntree_1 = rrcf.RCTree()\r\n\r\nfor index, point in enumerate(X):\r\n    tree_0.insert_point(point, index=index)\r\n    tree_1.insert_point(point, index=index)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(tree_0)\r\n\r\n─+\r\n ├───+\r\n │   ├───+\r\n │   │   ├──(6)\r\n │   │   └───+\r\n │   │       ├───+\r\n │   │       │   ├───+\r\n │   │       │   │   ├───+\r\n │   │       │   │   │   ├──(4)\r\n │   │       │   │   │   └──(2)\r\n │   │       │   │   └──(0)\r\n │   │       │   └──(7)\r\n │   │       └──(5)\r\n │   └──(1)\r\n └──(3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(tree_1)\r\n\r\n─+\r\n ├───+\r\n │   ├──(6)\r\n │   └──(2)\r\n └───+\r\n     ├───+\r\n     │   ├───+\r\n     │   │   ├───+\r\n     │   │   │   ├──(7)\r\n     │   │   │   └───+\r\n     │   │   │       ├──(3)\r\n     │   │   │       └──(4)\r\n     │   │   └──(5)\r\n     │   └──(0)\r\n     └──(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, even with the exact same point set you should be able to build an ensemble.
