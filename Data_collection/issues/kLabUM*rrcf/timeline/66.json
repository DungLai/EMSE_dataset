Each pipe has different water pressure. I get the out as a number when I sent a command to the sensor. So can I use a global threshold for coDisp ? or Should it be unique to the pipe ?\r\n\r\nSo I idea I have is to initiate new object for each pipe. But could the threshold value for codisp be global or unique to the instance? If it is unique to the instance, How can I figure out a way to use different codisp values for all 40 pipes. \r\n\r\nAlso the reason that i chose this algorithm was it can detect anomalies of streaming data. The pressure of the pipes changes according to the time of the day. So the rrcf detect those anomalies without a problem. However, this threshold thing is hard to figure out. I hope it is a global one :D .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/546800064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vinura","id":11626591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjI2NTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11626591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura","html_url":"https://github.com/vinura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
