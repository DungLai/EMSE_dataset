However, I have the following problems when using RRCF. In Figure 1, it can be seen that there is a segment in the middle of the data (orange line) with obvious abnormalities. However, in the second picture, the highest anomaly score of the anomaly segment is only 0.25, and the anomaly score of the later segments with little anomaly is occasionally 0.25. This makes me very confused.\r\n![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56470097/96087982-545ca200-0ef7-11eb-9ef2-c1bb34956dc1.png)\r\n![Figure_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56470097/96087996-5888bf80-0ef7-11eb-9cd1-797bf8de1100.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/708945073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zhoulinfeng0510","id":56470097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDcwMDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56470097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510","html_url":"https://github.com/Zhoulinfeng0510","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zhoulinfeng0510/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/716588216","html_url":"https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/78#issuecomment-716588216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/78","id":716588216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjU4ODIxNg==","user":{"login":"yasirroni","id":48709672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzA5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48709672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni","html_url":"https://github.com/yasirroni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T14:35:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T14:35:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> If you want to use shingles, each point inserted into the tree should be of the form:\r\n> \r\n> `[x_1(t_1), x_1(t_2), ... x_1(t_n), x_2(t_1), x_2(t_2), ... x_2(t_n), ... x_m(t_1), x_m(t_2), ... x_m(t_n)]`\r\n> ...\r\n> `[x_1(t_2), x_1(t_3), ... x_1(t_n+1), x_2(t_2), x_2(t_3), ... x_2(t_n+1), ... x_m(t_2), x_m(t_3), ... x_m(t_n+1)]`\r\n> ...\r\n> \r\n> And so on.\r\n> \r\n> Each point will be of dimension (1 x nm) where n is the shingle size and m is the number of variables.\r\n\r\nThis should be added to the doc example (didn't see it, either I miss it or not documented).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/716588216/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yasirroni","id":48709672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzA5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48709672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni","html_url":"https://github.com/yasirroni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yasirroni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
