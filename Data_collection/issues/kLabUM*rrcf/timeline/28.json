As a side note, it would be interesting to look at the properties of the codisp estimator as a function of the number of trees, tree size, etc. \r\n\r\nHave you tested how much of a speedup you're getting from parallelizing? I briefly experimented with using the multiprocessing module but wasn't able to get a significant speedup.\r\n\r\nFor batch insertion, you would need to show that the implementation works out

But how can I build an application with rrcf to  detect several thousands of time series that stream in every 1 minute synchronously with reasonable cpu and memory consumption? Have you any suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-18T02:50:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T02:50:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70","id":538714530,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Mzg3MTQ1MzA=","number":70,"title":"inference

Thanks for implementing this. I have a use case that need train the rrcf using some given dataset, and then predict on unseen data samples this haven't been seen during training period. \r\n\r\nCan we use batch mode to achieve that? One simple solution I can come up with is to first insert that point to the forest, calculate the codisp, and then delete it. I am wondering is there any smarter ways to save the inference time?\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
