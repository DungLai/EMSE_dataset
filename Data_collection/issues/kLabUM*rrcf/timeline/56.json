I believe I've found the reason the bug is being triggered.\r\n\r\nIt's happening when you try to insert a point that is a near-duplicate, but doesn't meet the tolerance criteria for a duplicate in at least one dimension. So, the point that it failed on for me was:\r\n\r\n```\r\narray([24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722,\r\n       24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722,\r\n       24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.11841722,\r\n       24.11841722, 24.11841722, 24.09805235])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference between this point and the nearest duplicate was:\r\n\r\n```\r\narray([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,\r\n        0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,\r\n        0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,\r\n        0.        ,  0.        , -0.02036487])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it wasn't identified as a duplicate, but was possibly too close to the nearest point to successfully find a cut. I will have to look into why the algorithm wasn't able to find a cut. Another issue is that it was trying to be inserted into a single-point tree (all duplicates), which might be triggering some kind of edge case.\r\n\r\nEdit: I also just realized that the leaf depth is -1 for all the duplicate leaves, which suggests that this attribute was decremented incorrectly.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: The error seems to occur shortly after the first time the first negative depth is encountered, so I believe this is the main problem. Still trying to figure out what causes this to happen. Sometimes it can take 700,000+ insertions for it to occur.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/495274096/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/495295847","html_url":"https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/56#issuecomment-495295847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/56","id":495295847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTI5NTg0Nw==","user":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T16:43:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T16:43:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think I may have found the issue.

@sapols,\r\n\r\nI believe I fixed the issue. I've pulled the modified code into master. Still need to upload to pypi.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are still running into this issue.\r\n\r\nA couple notes:\r\n\r\n- If you're running on a large dataset like this one, I'd recommend using either:\r\n  - Batch mode: https://klabum.github.io/rrcf/taxi.html\r\n  - Parallelization: https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/28\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of FIFO sampling, I'd probably recommend using something like reservoir sampling:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMDB","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/495324742/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdbartos","id":8175317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzUzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8175317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbartos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbartos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2363313169,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM2MzMxMzE2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/events/2363313169","actor":{"login":"sapols","id":14846863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ2ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14846863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols","html_url":"https://github.com/sapols","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-23T18:06:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2363313170,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNjMzMTMxNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/events/2363313170","actor":{"login":"sapols","id":14846863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ2ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14846863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols","html_url":"https://github.com/sapols","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-23T18:06:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/comments/495694541","html_url":"https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/56#issuecomment-495694541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kLabUM/rrcf/issues/56","id":495694541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTY5NDU0MQ==","user":{"login":"sapols","id":14846863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODQ2ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14846863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols","html_url":"https://github.com/sapols","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapols/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-24T16:17:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T16:17:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mdbartos
