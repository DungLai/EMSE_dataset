It appears `/mlmodel` directory doesn't exist. Is this something that greengrass is supposed to set up? Maybe this is a bug in green grass.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:03.357+08:00][FATAL]-lambda_runtime.py:140,Failed to import handler function \"inference.handler\" due to exception: model_path /mlmodel doesn't exist\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:03.357+08:00][FATAL]-lambda_runtime.py:380,Failed to initialize Lambda runtime due to exception: model_path /mlmodel doesn't exist\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-__init__.py:1037,2020-07-07 11:48:04,437 ERROR error in DLRModel instantiation model_path /mlmodel doesn't exist\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dlr/api.py\", line 82, in __init__\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-    self._impl = DLRModelImpl(model_path, dev_type, dev_id)\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dlr/dlr_model.py\", line 101, in __init__\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-    raise ValueError(\"model_path %s doesn't exist\" % model_path)\r\n[2020-07-07T11:48:04.56+08:00][ERROR]-ValueError: model_path /mlmodel doesn't exist\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/issues/comments/665777033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3599933247,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU5OTkzMzI0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/issues/events/3599933247","actor":{"login":"eddywart","id":57341035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57341035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart","html_url":"https://github.com/eddywart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T16:47:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3599933256,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1OTk5MzMyNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/issues/events/3599933256","actor":{"login":"eddywart","id":57341035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzQxMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57341035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart","html_url":"https://github.com/eddywart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddywart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T16:47:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
