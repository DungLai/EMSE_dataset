But the compiled model files are different and I could run only the model from the Frankfurt region on my target device. I used the following parameters for model compilation.\r\n\r\ntarget_device = Jetson Nano\r\nFramework = MXNet\r\ninput = {\"data\":[1,3,512,512]}\r\n\r\nThe compiled models were different. The model from the Frankfurt region has a size of 42.5MB whereas model from the Ohio region is 91.9MB in size. The file details from both regions are attached below.\r\n\r\nFrankfurt region\r\n![model_files_frankfurt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65023541/93068370-a7370580-f67c-11ea-8bfa-eaf2c04a33e2.png)\r\n\r\nOhio region\r\n![model_files_ohio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65023541/93068819-40feb280-f67d-11ea-82ab-231ff48b385b.png)\r\n\r\nApart from the _compiled.meta_ file, other files have different sizes. DLR 1.2 version was used to run both models and the files _dlr.h and libdlr.so_ were removed from the compiled models. When I tried to run the compiled model from the Ohio region on Jetson Nano, the following error occurred. \r\n\r\n`ERROR: TVMError: Check failed: f != nullptr: Loader of metadata(runtime.module.loadbinary_metadata) is not presented.#012Stack trace:#012  File \"/packages/neo-ai-dlr/3rdparty/tvm/src/runtime/library_module.cc\", line 150#012  [bt] (0) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(dmlc::LogMessageFatal::~LogMessageFatal()+0x38) [0x7ef6d17698]#012  [bt] (1) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(tvm::runtime::ProcessModuleBlob(char const*, tvm::runtime::ObjectPtr<tvm::runtime::Library>)+0x2448) [0x7ef72df4a8]#012  [bt] (2) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(tvm::runtime::CreateModuleFromLibrary(tvm::runtime::ObjectPtr<tvm::runtime::Library>)+0x1d0) [0x7ef72e0480]#012  [bt] (3) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(+0x244bb8) [0x7ef6d3fbb8]#012  [bt] (4) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(tvm::runtime::Module::LoadFromFile(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)+0x1a0) [0x7ef72e5328]#012  [bt] (5) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(dlr::TVMModel::SetupTVMModule(std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, std::allocator<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > > >)+0x1e30) [0x7ef6d70e98]#012  [bt] (6) /usr/local/dlr/libdlr.so(CreateDLRModel+0x1428) [0x7ef6d46a88]`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do the compiled models differ based on AWS regions?
