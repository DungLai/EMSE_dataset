But building C/C++ code is not actually necessary since they already have pre-built `libdlr.so` in the model artifact.\r\nCustomers should be able to easily install \"universal\" version of DLR package using pip. That \"generic\" package can have only python code.\r\nWe need to investigate what should be uploaded to PyPI repo in order to create this \"universal\" DLR package on the client side.\r\nMaybe it should be a source version of DLR pkg with build script which skips C/C++ code building.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/issues/306/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr/issues/306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
