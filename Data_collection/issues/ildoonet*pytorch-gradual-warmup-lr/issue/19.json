When I use `ReduceLROnPlateau` as the `after_scheduler` of `GradualWarmupScheduler`, the warm-up failed. The way I get the learning rate is: `optim.param_groups[0]['lr']`. Then I use `get_lr` to get the learning rate, I found it is correct.\r\n2. I use `StepLR` as the `after_scheduler`, I found there was no exception and no error.\r\n\r\nTherefor, I think the learning rate of the optimizer hadn't been warmed up correctly.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ildoonet/pytorch-gradual-warmup-lr/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ildoonet/pytorch-gradual-warmup-lr/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
