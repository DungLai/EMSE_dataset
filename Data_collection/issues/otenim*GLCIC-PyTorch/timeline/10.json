was apparently not used to train the proposed model in the original paper, so it's difficult to tell a promising training setting.\r\n\r\nHowever, the paper says they used Places2.\r\nThis dataset is similar to Imagenet, so I think the training setting they used for Places2 would work to some extent.\r\nPlease add the following options when executing the training script:\r\n\r\n> --hole_min_w 96 --hole_max_w 128 --hole_min_h 96 --hole_max_h 128 --cn_input_size 256 --ld_input_size 128 --bsize 96 --data_parallel --arc places2\r\n\r\nThe last option ``--arc`` changes the network architecture of Context Discriminator slightly.\r\nPlease check models.py if you're interested.\r\n\r\nBe careful about memory utilization of GPUs.\r\nThe above setting requires a large amount of memory (the authors used Tesla K80(24GB) x 4 to conduct the experiments).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/comments/534680601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/comments/565801958","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/10#issuecomment-565801958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/10","id":565801958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTgwMTk1OA==","user":{"login":"zhengbowei","id":49556865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTU2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49556865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengbowei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengbowei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-15T11:45:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-15T11:45:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hello,
