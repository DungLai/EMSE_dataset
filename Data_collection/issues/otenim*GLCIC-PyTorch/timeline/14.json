\r\n\r\nI think it comes to the unpaired/paired supervised training for GAN. If you use the same hole generation for the fake and real images, the inputs (fake and real) to the local discriminator are paired. Technically, different hole generations should also work since the goal of discriminator is to identify if the real and fake images are from the same distribution. My intuition is that if we stick to have the same hole generations, the inpainting results may look more similar to the real image. But it will need some experiments to test the performance difference for the image inpainting application before drawing the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThanks,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/comments/586493109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zhiyang-fu","id":10102446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAyNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10102446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiyang-fu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3040289681,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA0MDI4OTY4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/events/3040289681","actor":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-14T22:11:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3040289684,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNDAyODk2ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/events/3040289684","actor":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-14T22:11:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7281321025,"node_id":"CE_lADOB8N6Tc4hfbNQzwAAAAGyACRB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/events/7281321025","actor":{"login":"zhiyang-fu","id":10102446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAyNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10102446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiyang-fu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-29T18:44:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
