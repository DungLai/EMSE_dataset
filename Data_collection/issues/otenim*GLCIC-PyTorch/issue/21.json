(i set batch_size=8 to fit my poor GPU(GTX1660Ti)) \r\nI used the newest version of your code(till 2020.10.20), so there isn't any problem with poisson_blend.py ,i guess?\r\n\r\nHope for your response,thanks again for your solid work!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
