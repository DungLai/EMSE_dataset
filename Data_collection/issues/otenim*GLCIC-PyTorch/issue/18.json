But I find a small bug is that you forgot to use the model.train() and model.eval() to switch the performence of batch normalize layer. And when I train the dataset with different brightness, the predict result will become wired if I don't use the model.eval(). Hope it can help.","closed_by":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
