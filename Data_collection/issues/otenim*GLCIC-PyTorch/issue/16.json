In the case of an image with missing data, you would not have the original image information available. I did the tweak on my checkout and the result is that the opencv blend function you use simply doesn't result in a well looking image. What would be necessary to have a result as in Fig. 7 from the paper if you had no original image information available? (Cause blending the original with the inpainted one kind of seems unnecessary when you have the original already available ...)","closed_by":{"login":"otenim","id":26879886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26879886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim","html_url":"https://github.com/otenim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otenim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
