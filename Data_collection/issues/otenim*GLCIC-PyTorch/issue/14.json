First of all, I am assuming that the \"hole area\" in your code represents the region that the local discriminator gonna look at. However, I notice that [here](https://github.com/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/blob/16bd3bbab468e83ced422fa7eb3167890d83189d/train.py#L297) and [here](https://github.com/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/blob/16bd3bbab468e83ced422fa7eb3167890d83189d/train.py#L316) you generated random hole area for fake and real images respectively. \r\n\r\nAre there any reasons or benefits doing this? Or should the hole area for the real and fake images be the same at each iteration?","closed_by":{"login":"zhiyang-fu","id":10102446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAyNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10102446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiyang-fu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiyang-fu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/otenim/GLCIC-PyTorch/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
