The loss function (categorical focal loss, CFL) worked well in some model/data but did not converge at all in other cases. For example, I tried CFL with ResNet50 for bacterial detection which didn't converge at all with 26% train accuracy for 4 classes while categorical cross entropy didn't have this problem with 90% test accuracy. But CFL for 1D-CNN with the same data converged well with 99% test accuracy.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
