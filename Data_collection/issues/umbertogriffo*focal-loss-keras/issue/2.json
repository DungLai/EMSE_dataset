As in, there are multiple labels that can be 1 at the same time and hence, the sum of probabilities is not necessarily equal to 1 (as is the case with softmax). \r\n\r\nI came to your repo from [this](https://github.com/mkocabas/focal-loss-keras/issues/13) issue. Please let me know which loss function I can use in this scenario. I actually saw the code but wasn't entirely sure that the binary_focal_loss function is suitable in this problem. It looked to me as if it's only for binary classification and not for multi-label classification task.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/2/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
