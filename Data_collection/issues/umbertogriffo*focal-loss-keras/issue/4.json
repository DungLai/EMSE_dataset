It is just constant applied to all the cases, while in binary scenario it really does highlight imbalance scenario, with alpha and 1 - alpha.\r\nShouldn't we therefore choose different alpha for every class, for example using class weights from scikit learn? \r\n\r\nI believe, for multiclass scenario there should be additional parameter called weights or so, which for example could be the dictionary outputed by class weights from scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nalpha = weights[numpy.argmax(y_true)]\r\n\r\nThis line would select proper alpha for current class. For smaller classes it would be big number, for bigger classes small number.","closed_by":{"login":"umbertogriffo","id":1609440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo","html_url":"https://github.com/umbertogriffo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/4/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
