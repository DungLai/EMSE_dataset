@umbertogriffo \r\n\r\nThanks for the reply!\r\n\r\nDo you mean using softmax for multi-label classification (like [facebook paper](https://research.fb.com/publications/exploring-the-limits-of-weakly-supervised-pretraining/))? It's still a bit unclear. _Normally_, softmax is not used for multi-label classification. Can you explain what inputs you expect for your two functions binary_focal_loss and categorical_focal_loss? Do you expect only 2 classes (binary) or does it work for more than 2 classes?\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, when talking about multiple target classes, keras uses the term **binary_crossentropy** (keras.losses.binary_crossentropy) for multi-label classification tasks where the output activation unit should then be sigmoid. And **categorical_crossentropy** (keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy) is used for multi-class classification tasks with softmax output activation unit.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure that we are both on the same page, I will explain below what I mean with multi-label and multi-class classification terminologies.\r\n\r\nIn **multi-label classification** with 3 classes and 5 examples, the target vector would look like:\r\n```\r\n[0 0 1\r\n 1 0 1\r\n 0 0 0\r\n 0 1 1\r\n 0 1 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTarget vector for **multi-class classification** for a similar configuration would look like:\r\n```\r\n[0 0 1\r\n 1 0 0\r\n 0 1 0\r\n 0 1 0\r\n 1 0 0]\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/comments/475771994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abdullahshafin","id":23015838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE1ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23015838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin","html_url":"https://github.com/abdullahshafin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abdullahshafin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2223750336,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIyMzc1MDMzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/events/2223750336","actor":{"login":"umbertogriffo","id":1609440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo","html_url":"https://github.com/umbertogriffo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-22T20:32:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2223750337,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMjM3NTAzMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/events/2223750337","actor":{"login":"umbertogriffo","id":1609440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo","html_url":"https://github.com/umbertogriffo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-22T20:32:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/comments/476147038","html_url":"https://github.com/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/2#issuecomment-476147038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/umbertogriffo/focal-loss-keras/issues/2","id":476147038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjE0NzAzOA==","user":{"login":"umbertogriffo","id":1609440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo","html_url":"https://github.com/umbertogriffo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umbertogriffo/events{/privacy}","received_events
