That's a much more reasonable starting point.\r\n\r\nNote that the meshgrid() here is not the same as tf.meshgrid()! The code appears to be written for pre-1.0 TF, which probably didn't have tf.meshgrid().","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/comments/365213410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sesse","id":238700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODcwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/238700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse","html_url":"https://github.com/sesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sesse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
