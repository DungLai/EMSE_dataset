Just predict one frame using voxel flow at one time step. And the predicted frame is used as one of the inputs for the next time step.\r\n\r\nThe \"non-recurrent\" extension of voxel flow to handle, e.g. 2-frame-input, 2-frame-output extrapolation/prediction setting, would be: (1) Conditioned on the two inputs, two different voxel flow fields are learned. And then the two voxel flow fields are applied to the two inputs respectively to obtain two warped frames; (2) Next, we learn a fusion mask to combine the two warped frames to generate the current prediction; (3) The similar procedure can be applied to other output frames. This procedure can also be simplified by exploiting the time interval relations between frames, such that voxel flow fields can be directly re-scaled.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/comments/415667169/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"liuziwei7","id":3158258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3158258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7","html_url":"https://github.com/liuziwei7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuziwei7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/comments/804849533","html_url":"https://github.com/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/5#issuecomment-804849533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/5","id":804849533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDg0OTUzMw==","user":{"login":"zzwei1","id":49705380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzA1Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49705380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1","html_url":"https://github.com/zzwei1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T12:08:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T12:08:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Good question.

What confused me is that, how should I make multi-frame prediction using Voxel-Flow? When I have the first 5 frames as input, I concat them along time dimension, and then followed the precedure in Voxel-Flow to generate the fiest predicted frame. I understand so far. But what should I do next to generate the second, third frames? Should I concat the first predicted frame with the 5 ground truth frames to generate a new input? I don't think it's correct because the input channels will be changed if I do so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/comments/804849533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zzwei1","id":49705380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzA1Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49705380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1","html_url":"https://github.com/zzwei1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzwei1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
