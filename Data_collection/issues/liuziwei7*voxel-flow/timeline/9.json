Is it the idea inspired from FCN? FCN can work on arbitrary sized images although the model is trained with resized image of 256x256.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/comments/424238235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jian3xiao","id":33883991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODgzOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33883991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao","html_url":"https://github.com/jian3xiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jian3xiao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
