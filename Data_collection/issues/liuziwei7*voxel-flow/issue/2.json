Is there any criterion that the triple frames should suffice?\r\nIn your paper, your explain \"We sampled frame triplets with obvious motion\". how your define the \"obvious motion\"? Is that possible to provide the code for making triple frames dataset from UCF101 videos?\r\n3. the network you used in your paper seem like u-net akin structure. but in your code, it seem like you use different net structure that don't use skipping connect.  Is my understanding right?\r\n\r\nvery looking forward to your reply, thanks a lot!!!","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
