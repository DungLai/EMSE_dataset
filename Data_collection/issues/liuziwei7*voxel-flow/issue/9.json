And I have a question. \r\nThe model is trained on UCF101 frames resized to 256x256, but how I test the model using original size frames. The paper said , We train our method on the public UCF-101 dataset, but test it on a wide variety of videos. Our method can be applied at any resolution.\r\nI guess the procedure like this when I want test 856x480 two frames. First frames are resized to 256x256 and feed into the model. Then the model output a voxel flow fields 256x256x3, and re-scaled it to flow_new=height(or width)*flow. Finally,  obtain the interpolationed frame by using bilinear_interp and mask.\r\nI don't know if this process is correct, and how the real procedure when applied different size frames.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuziwei7/voxel-flow/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
