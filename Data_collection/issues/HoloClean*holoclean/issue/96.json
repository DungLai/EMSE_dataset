Since above data frame was not used in subsequent operations, i moved forwarded by simply  bypassing it for this code block, however after 4 hours of execution , i am now facing an issue where log just shows killed. \r\n`21:09:36 - [DEBUG] - Time to execute query: 0.00 secs\r\n21:09:36 - [DEBUG] - featurizing training data...\r\n21:09:43 - [DEBUG] - Time to execute query: 4.46 secs\r\nKilled\r\n`\r\nIt seems tensor.cat is blowing memory here...\r\nAs shown below: running a sample for hospital and performing memory analysis, with little data. It turned out , the tensors footprint is 228 MB which grows further when combining all tensors.\r\nto 1.4GB. \r\nThis is not scaling well, if we need to process of larger dataset of 2-4GB in a day.. Any suggestions ?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3977272/64341699-8a4a0a00-d006-11e9-8706-025c755c70cf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Also, we noticed archived version was compatible with spark, is there any specific reason to move away from spark. Since we are planning to use spark to manage huge datasets with holoclean. \r\nAny suggestions ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"thodrek","id":1043311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1043311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek","html_url":"https://github.com/thodrek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
