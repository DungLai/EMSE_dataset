I wrote rule \"if two records have same state-code, then state name should be same\".\r\n\r\nBut it was not at all correcting any records. Then i saw the correlation between state-code and state name, which was less than the default threshold used for holoclean (0.1), thus no repair was made.\r\n\r\nTo find correlation between categorical columns, holoclean does label encoding first for these columns and then checks for correlation, but I believe label encoding is not a good measure to calculate correlation between two categorical columns. We can say that state-code and state-name are correlated columns, but label encoding is not efficient to tell that.\r\n\r\nI tried using statistical test like chi-square, and it gave me a good correlation between the state code and state name, thus errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nI have two questions to ask:\r\n1) Was there a specific reason of using label encoding to find correlation between two categorical columns ? \r\n2) Since repairs are done only on columns which are mentioned in rules, then how holoclean is better than a rule based approach. We can simply write code to correct errors for two columns, which says if two state code are same, then state names should be same (considering concept of minimality).","closed_by":{"login":"thodrek","id":1043311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1043311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek","html_url":"https://github.com/thodrek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
