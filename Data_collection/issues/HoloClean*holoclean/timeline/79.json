We realized that the current implementation of correlation is incorrect since we are dealing with categorical values. We've implemented a correct \"correlation\" for categorical values using a (normalized) conditional entropy measure in the `dev` branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/HoloClean/holoclean/blob/6db22a6d991e1eb89fa609dff581fd92ca660cc9/domain/domain.py#L62-L107\r\n\r\n2. Repairs are done on cells that are detected with errors. Error detection in the current state only marks cells as potentially erroneous if they violate \"rules\" (denial constraints) and values that are NULL/empty. A rule-based approach using minimality may work in the simple case where we have an FD, but it is unclear how minimality would work with more complicated constraints with inequalities. Holoclean tries to address this in general with denial constraints and instead of explicit minimality repairing it learns the best repair based on the statistical properties of the data.\r\n\r\nI would recommend you use more developed `dev` branch for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/comments/486011614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richardwu","id":10563314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYzMzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10563314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu","html_url":"https://github.com/richardwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2295631738,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI5NTYzMTczOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/events/2295631738","actor":{"login":"deepakrajwani","id":44234264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjM0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44234264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani","html_url":"https://github.com/deepakrajwani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-23T23:33:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2295631739,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyOTU2MzE3Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/events/2295631739","actor":{"login":"deepakrajwani","id":44234264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjM0MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44234264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani","html_url":"https://github.com/deepakrajwani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakrajwani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-23T23:33:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2652081076,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY1MjA4MTA3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/events/2652081076","actor":{"login":"thodrek","id":1043311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1043311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek","html_url":"https://github.com/thodrek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thodrek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-21T11:41:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
