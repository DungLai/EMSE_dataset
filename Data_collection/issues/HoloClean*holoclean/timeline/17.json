If it is possible for you to use dockers, I suggest starting a postgres docker instance with the latest postgres version 11 as follows\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run --name pghc \\\r\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=holo -e POSTGRES_USER=holocleanuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=abcd1234 \\\r\n    -p 5432:5432 \\\r\n    -d postgres:11\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you can use `docker start pghc` and `docker stop pghc`  to start/stop the container.\r\n\r\nYou can find details about this image [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and feel free to ask about any details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/comments/439542378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"minafarid","id":9206118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDYxMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9206118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid","html_url":"https://github.com/minafarid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minafarid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1972335501,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk3MjMzNTUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/events/1972335501","actor":{"login":"pmaetzig","id":16361980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzYxOTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16361980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig","html_url":"https://github.com/pmaetzig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-16T21:59:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1972335502,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NzIzMzU1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/events/1972335502","actor":{"login":"pmaetzig","id":16361980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzYxOTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16361980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig","html_url":"https://github.com/pmaetzig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-16T21:59:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/comments/439813242","html_url":"https://github.com/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/17#issuecomment-439813242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoloClean/holoclean/issues/17","id":439813242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTgxMzI0Mg==","user":{"login":"pmaetzig","id":16361980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzYxOTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16361980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig","html_url":"https://github.com/pmaetzig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmaetzig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T08:43:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T08:43:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks,
