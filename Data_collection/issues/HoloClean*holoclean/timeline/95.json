But we rely on a DBMS (postgres in this case) to store and query the data and perform various analytics that cannot be done on plain CSV or parquet files, which only store data. \r\nI would suggest using a docker for postgres if you are not familiar with its setup. Hopefully, this makes it easier for you to try HoloClean out.
