I have some of my doubts and would appreciate if you can clear them out. \r\n\r\n1- Should I change SELECTED_LABELS  to = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] ? If I do so, it says that it is predicting 14 emotions rather than 7 which is weird. \r\n\r\n2- when I use convertFER2013.py file, it makes .npy file, but doesn't download any .jpg, or .png files from the dataset. Is this the right path that I am going ? \r\n\r\n3- once I run convertFER2013.py file. I just run train.py. Antything else that you would like me to suggest? \r\n\r\nOr any of the state of the art models you'd like to suggest? I am working on a project and would appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGaurav","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amineHorseman/facial-expression-recognition-using-cnn/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amineHorseman/facial-expression-recognition-using-cnn/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
