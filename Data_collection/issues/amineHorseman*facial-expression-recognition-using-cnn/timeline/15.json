The question is rather large, you have many possibilities, I think you can feed the voice data to an RNN and the images to a CNN, then mix the output dense layers and before the last output layer, but it's still speculations and it's better to look for existing work before in paper to check if that idea was not explored before","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amineHorseman/facial-expression-recognition-using-cnn/issues/comments/476800804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amineHorseman","id":15238963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjM4OTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15238963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman","html_url":"https://github.com/amineHorseman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineHorseman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
