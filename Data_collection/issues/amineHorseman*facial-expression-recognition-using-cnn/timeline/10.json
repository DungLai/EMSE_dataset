I wanted to limit the number of samples during the bugfixes, because I couldn't retrain each time the network on the whole dataset, especially that I used the CPU only. \r\n\r\n2. Since the Fer2013 dataset is unbalanced (there's more samples on some expressions), I wanted to check the bias of the classifier. The experiment consisted to train the classifier after making all the expressions having the same number of samples, then compare it with the biased classifier, which uses all the data.\r\n\r\nI think I just pushed the code then and forget to reset this variable. So please just change the `line 24 `and set the limit to a very big number to skip the condition, something like:\r\n\r\n`IMAGES_PER_LABEL = 10000000
