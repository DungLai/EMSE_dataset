hi! You said about fixed pipeline and order of the operations. Imagine that we have only 3 filters and, as far as I understood your idea correctly,  we need to set order. What do you think it is important to set this order in special way or it can be in any order? This is a debatable question, because applying filters often are not commutative. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean this: \"the fixed pipeline can be significantly longer than the version with RL because the selection of filters is disabled\"? Why is it longer than RL? I suppose we need to apply only 3 filters (my example) in certain order with before selected parameters.
