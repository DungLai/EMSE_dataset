The colorspace relationship between the input and the \"recovered\" output is actually very complicated (given the complexity of PhotoPro RGB, closed-sourced Lightroom processing pipeline, etc), and based on previous work I know, people simply assume what we are doing is a good enough approximation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yuanming-hu/exposure/issues/comments/450285383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yuanming-hu","id":6553256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTMyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6553256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuanming-hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
