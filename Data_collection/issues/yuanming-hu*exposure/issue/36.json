In my sense, the aimed preprocessing consists of three steps as follow:\r\n1) white balance 2) demosaick the (bayer) raw data 3) convert the linear camera-specific raw space into linear ProPhoto RGB space by a 3x3 color transformation matrix. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, it seems the additional step, \\e.g. gamma correction is also applied by LightRoom, since I find in your implementation, the linearizing is necessary to invert the effect of non-linear gamma correction. I also have no idea how you can figure out the parameters of gamma correction there (is that just an approximation like 1/2.2?) \r\n\r\nIn summary, my question is what you exactly intended to do in Adobe Lightroom, and can it be replaced by a invokable API? \r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yuanming-hu/exposure/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yuanming-hu/exposure/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
