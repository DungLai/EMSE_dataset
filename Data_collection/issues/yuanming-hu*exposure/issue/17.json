I found that exposureNet can generate a mask when generate a filter parameters, however, only 5-6 parameters and get_mask() function can produce a H*W*1 mask. There is no hint in paper about how to train the mask and how to generate the mask, so can you help me to explain theory about the mask using in exposureNet.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!","closed_by":{"login":"yuanming-hu","id":6553256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTMyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6553256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuanming-hu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanming-hu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yuanming-hu/exposure/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yuanming-hu/exposure/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
