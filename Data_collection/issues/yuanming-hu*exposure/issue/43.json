In your slides, you suggest that this model can be trained using exclusively the retouched image data, but the train.py function seems to expect matched pairs of images with the untouched data being in one folder, the retouched data in a second folder... What about the test data? In the config_sintel.py file, the fake_data_provider_test folder is the same as the training folder, while the comment above it specifically says not to do this. \r\n\r\nRight now I am thinking I should have three folders in my model directory, like this: \r\n\r\ncfg.fake_data_provider = lambda: FolderDataProvider(folder='models/ColorCorrect/Uncorrected', default_batch_size=cfg.batch_size)\r\ncfg.fake_data_provider_test = lambda: FolderDataProvider(folder='models/ColorCorrect/Validation', default_batch_size=cfg.batch_size)\r\ncfg.real_data_provider = lambda: FolderDataProvider(folder='models/ColorCorrect/Corrected', default_batch_size=cfg.batch_size)\r\n\r\nWhere the Uncorrected Folder has 300 untouched images, the Validation Folder has 50 different untouched images, and the Corrected Folder has a total of 350 images, all matching to either the contents of the Uncorrected or Test Folders. \r\n\r\nIs this the correct approach? \r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and for sharing your very impressive work!
