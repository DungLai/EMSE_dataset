Right now the detection is quite capricious and if the pose you make is too complicated, it may not be recognized as a hand at all.\r\nThe data has to be greatly improved as it's highly biased for now, considering only my right hand was used to train the different poses.\r\nThe challenge with Sign language will be the speed at which the person signs. And even though the signs are recognized correctly, you would then have to process them to get the meaning. It's not impossible but definitely challenging.  \r\n\r\nTo really reply to your question, I'll think about adding specific signs to the training in the next version. In the mean time, I'm open to contribution and I would love to collaborate with people on something like this!\r\n\r\nPS: Thanks a lot!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MrEliptik/HandPose/issues/comments/470424577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MrEliptik","id":24484962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDg0OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24484962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik","html_url":"https://github.com/MrEliptik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2186396598,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxODYzOTY1OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MrEliptik/HandPose/issues/events/2186396598","actor":{"login":"MrEliptik","id":24484962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDg0OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24484962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik","html_url":"https://github.com/MrEliptik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-07T08:00:48Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2189433705,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE4OTQzMzcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MrEliptik/HandPose/issues/events/2189433705","actor":{"login":"MrEliptik","id":24484962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDg0OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24484962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik","html_url":"https://github.com/MrEliptik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-08T08:05:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
