I'm looking to use this to add features to a classifier I'm developing for ASL phonology -- if we end up using this repository, how would you prefer to be cited in a paper?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm running into a problem in retraining. When I use AddPose.py, after I record a video it says \"processed 1 frame(s)\" and when I look in the poses folder the .avi video is not readable and no images have been taken out from it. This causes errors when I try to run cnn.py. Any idea what could cause this? The AddPose script itself doesn't raise any errors. \r\n\r\n(I am using a slightly newer version on tensorflow, 1.13 not 1.12, but didn't think this should be a problem).

The problem was that the default width and height on my machine were different from the hardcoded values. I fixed this by adding this line before the \"out\" assignment in AddPose:\r\n```\r\n`width = 0\r\n    height = 0\r\n    if cap.isOpened(): \r\n        width = int(cap.get(3))  # float\r\n        height = int(cap.get(4)) # float`\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"MrEliptik","id":24484962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDg0OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24484962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik","html_url":"https://github.com/MrEliptik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrEliptik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MrEliptik/HandPose/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MrEliptik/HandPose/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
