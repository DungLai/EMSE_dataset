Therefore, our MFQE approach targets mainly on compressed video (so the bit flow is available).\r\nWe recently find that QP is the key factor when detecting PQF. Without QP information, the detection accuracy may drop to 60~70%.\r\nIf you have no QP information, we suggest that you can search for some objective quality assessment approaches especially for compression artifacts, e.g. _No-reference quality assessment of deblocked images_, 2016 Neurocomputing. You can also consider other sota approaches based on Conv-LSTM etc that are with no need for quality assessment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0/issues/comments/570864405/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ryanxingql","id":34084019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDg0MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34084019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanxingql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":4246655746,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyNDY2NTU3NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0/issues/events/4246655746","actor":{"login":"ryanxingql","id":34084019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDg0MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34084019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanxingql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-25T16:56:43Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4840564935,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDg0MDU2NDkzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0/issues/events/4840564935","actor":{"login":"ryanxingql","id":34084019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDg0MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34084019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanxingql","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanxingql/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T01:33:46Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
