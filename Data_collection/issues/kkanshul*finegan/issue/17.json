Particularly, I want to get the number claimed in your paper to make sure that everything I have done is correct. However, in your paper, it is claimed IS=52.53±0.45 and FID=11.25. But I got IS=43.20±0.54 and FID=22.08. I think I might have made some mistakes in details. \r\n\r\n### What I did\r\nI generate 30K 128x128 child images with your released model on Birds, wherein 150 images for each child category. \r\n(1) I compute the IS with your released finetuned inception model. The generated images are resized to 299x299 normalized to be within [-1, 1] before fed into the network. Mean and std are computed over 10 splits.\r\n(2) I compute the FID with default inception model using \r\n```\r\ncalculate_fid_given_paths([/path/to/generated/images, /path/to/real/images], batch_size=1, cuda=True, dims=2048)\r\n```\r\nNote that /path/to/real/images are original CUB images without any cropping or resizing.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation codes\r\nIS: https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch\r\nFID: https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n1. Do you use the finetuned inception model for computing FID?\r\n2. Should I use the images that are cropped with 1.5x bounding boxes from original images to compute FID?\r\n3. Should I first resize the real images to 128x128 and then feed them into the inception network (which automatically resizes input to 299x299) to compute FID?\r\n4. Is the number I got lies in the normal variation? I suppose the quality of generated images may be different for different times of generation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nB.T.W. I am also curious about the results of LR-GAN you got in Table1. Do you train LR-GAN on the original CUB images or on the cropped images?\r\n\r\nB.T.W. I am using pytorch==1.3.0. Not sure if there is any version issue.
