But while explaining (ex. comment in line 337 of model.py and in the paper) we've associated 0 and 1 with the opposite classes. We'll correct the comment and the text in the paper, but it won't matter in the way we train FineGAN, because ultimately we want to learn a binary classifier which learns to associate one of the classes (either background or foreground) to 0 and the other to 1.\r\n\r\nThanks~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/485219442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/485261507","html_url":"https://github.com/kkanshul/finegan/issues/4#issuecomment-485261507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/4","id":485261507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTI2MTUwNw==","user":{"login":"Turlan","id":12882509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODgyNTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12882509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan","html_url":"https://github.com/Turlan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Turlan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T15:42:25Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T15:42:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
