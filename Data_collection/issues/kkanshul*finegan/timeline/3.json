The bounding box coordinates are just used to fetch patches that lie outside the bounding box (basically the patches which are not part of the foreground entity, i.e. background patches). These background patches are used used as 'real' patches for training generator/discriminator pair in the background stage. This is because we don't have access to complete background images to be used as real images. So the discriminator network at the background stage operates on a patch level, i.e. it assigns a real/fake score to each patch instead of a complete image (for more information about how discriminators are employed on a patch level, please see this discussion thread https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/39).\r\n\r\nIn simple words, the discriminator at background stage takes as input the complete real image and predicts a NxN matrix, where each member reflects the real/fake score of the corresponding member's receptive field in the input image. Now since we only have to obtain supervision from patches which lie outside the bounding box (true background patches), we need to mask those output members from the NxN matrix whose receptive fields in the input image contains regions inside the bounding box. \r\n\r\nIn the above code, a1, a2, b1 and b2 do just that. So all the members in NxN from a1:a2 (along rows) and b1:b2 (along columns) will be masked, and loss will only be computed from remaining members in NxN.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'warped_bbox', its just bounding box coordinates for the image after we've done some transformations on it (ex. resizing, random cropping, horizontal flip)\r\n\r\nNote: I know this is a complicated explanation. So let me know if some part didn't make sense   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/454216627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/468520733","html_url":"https://github.com/kkanshul/finegan/issues/3#issuecomment-468520733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/3","id":468520733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODUyMDczMw==","user":{"login":"sitongsu","id":38448207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDQ4MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38448207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu","html_url":"https://github.com/sitongsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitongsu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T02:42:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T02:42:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your detailed explanation.
