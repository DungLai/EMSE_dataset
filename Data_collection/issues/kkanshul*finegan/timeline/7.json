Thanks for pointing that out. I've added the new inception model here (https://github.com/kkanshul/finegan/blob/master/code/inception.py). Right now it is for birds, and if you need it for some other dataset, just change the last fully connected layer dimension (200 for cars, 120 for dogs). \r\n\r\nAs for the fine tuning of inception net, I just initialize the layers (except the last fully connected layer) with the inception network trained on ImageNet dataset. I then further train the network on the complete CUB dataset. I create a 80-20 split of CUB and use the 20 split as validation set to determine when to stop training the model.\r\n\r\nThanks ~\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/514511555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/514513063","html_url":"https://github.com/kkanshul/finegan/issues/7#issuecomment-514513063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/7","id":514513063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDUxMzA2Mw==","user":{"login":"bravotty","id":37895431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODk1NDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37895431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty","html_url":"https://github.com/bravotty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T07:23:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T07:23:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thx!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/514513063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bravotty","id":37895431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODk1NDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37895431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty","html_url":"https://github.com/bravotty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2514885213,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUxNDg4NTIxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/events/2514885213","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-28T19:42:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
