problem which could have been there in your implementation of the 256x256 version would be at your background stage. We use PatchGAN at the background stage, due to which we need to define the values of some hyperparameters, which are defined in lines 381-383 of trainer.py. These parameters are needed to accurately extract patches lying outside the bounding box. \r\n\r\nFor 256x256 version, the updated values of those parameters would be:\r\n`self.patch_stride = float(8)`\r\n`self.n_out = 24`\r\n`self.recp_field = 70`\r\nAnd yes, the real images and the discriminator inputs (and consequently the discriminator itself) would be different, and there isn't anything different we do for the 256 case, apart from adding more layers to process higher resolution inputs. \r\n\r\nMy version of 256x256 isn't cleaned up, so I don't think it will be helpful to you.

kidach1,\r\nSorry for the late response. I went through the changes you made, and it looks fine. The only difference is the CROP_IMG_SIZE parameter. You've set it to 252, while in my version it is 254 (apologies for not mentioning this before). I'm not sure what difference would this make, but you should try it. \r\nI've been a lot busy these past few weeks, but you should let me know of the result. Its just that I might be a bit late to
