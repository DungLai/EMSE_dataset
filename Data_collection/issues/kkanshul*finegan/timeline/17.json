The FID will depend on how exactly you're generating the 30k images. Are you iterating through all the child codes, and generating the images with parent/background code fixed? \r\n\r\nAnd yes, you should use 1.5 times cropped real images for computing the FID. \r\nThe inception model used for FID is the model pre-trained on ImageNet. We use the fine-tuned version only for computing the Inception score, where the model should be finetuned on all the 200 categories (for birds). \r\n\r\nAs for the variation, I believe FID could still be in that range, but IS does appear to be lower than usual.\r\nDouble check the image generation process, and see if that improves the score.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/706634971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
