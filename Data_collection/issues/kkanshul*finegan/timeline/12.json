We had used a pytorch implementation of FID to calculate the score, not the one you have linked. \r\nAnd also, you need to perform hard negative training (described in section 7.2 of the supplementary), which happens after the 600 epochs in the code provided. Empirically, hard negative training helps in getting rid of some of the distorted fake images, and hence helps improving the realism (measured by FID).\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/596919985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/596920278","html_url":"https://github.com/kkanshul/finegan/issues/12#issuecomment-596920278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/12","id":596920278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjkyMDI3OA==","user":{"login":"bravotty","id":37895431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODk1NDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37895431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty","html_url":"https://github.com/bravotty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-10T06:06:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T06:06:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/comments/596920278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bravotty","id":37895431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODk1NDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37895431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty","html_url":"https://github.com/bravotty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bravotty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3152546005,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE1MjU0NjAwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kkanshul/finegan/issues/events/3152546005","actor":{"login":"utkarshojha","id":23001336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAxMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23001336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarshojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarshojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-22T10:51:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
