However, it seemed the model could not get rid of the raindrops as well as the photo pairs(with raindrops, and after deraining) illustrated in the readme. May I ask what is your future plan? Or could you give me some instructions for continuing to train the model? \r\n     I am very curious about your answer. Thank you so much!
