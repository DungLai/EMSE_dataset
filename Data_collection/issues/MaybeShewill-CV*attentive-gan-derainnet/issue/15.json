It helps me a lot.\r\nBut, I have some questions about the training.\r\n1. the initial learning rate: you said that \"In my experiment, the training epochs are 200010, batch size is 1, the initialized learning rate is 0.001.\", However, when I checked the config file, I found that it was 0.002. When I trained with 0.002, the D_loss was very large. I guess the initial learning rate is quite important. So I wonder what is the exact value?\r\n2. When you are training your model, did you crop the original image into small patches? Did you aug the images or not? I think directly resizing the size into 240x360 is not a good choice.\r\nThx again for your excellent code.\r\n\r\nZewei\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MaybeShewill-CV","id":15725187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzI1MTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15725187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV","html_url":"https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
