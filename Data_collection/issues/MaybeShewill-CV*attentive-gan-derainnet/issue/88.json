At present, I am working on a real dataset where I have to remove raindrops. I found that you prepared a mask image with _diff_image >= 35 (Ref: attentive-gan-derainnet/data_provider/tf_io_pipline_tools.py/line-92). However, I am not getting why did you do that particularly. Can I get more information about this mask image preparation?\r\nThanks in advance.
