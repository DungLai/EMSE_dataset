I've found a performance issue in /data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py: `batch()` should be called before `map()`, which could make your program more efficient. Here is [the tensorflow document](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/data_performance?hl=zh_cn#vectorized_mapping) to support it.\r\n\r\nDetailed description is listed below:\r\n\r\n- `dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True)`[(here)](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/blob/4ec79993cf3d757741c9c88c1036d87bd46e982d/data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py#L290) should be called before `dataset.map(map_func=tf_io_pipline_tools.decode,num_parallel_calls=CFG.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS)`[(here)](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/blob/4ec79993cf3d757741c9c88c1036d87bd46e982d/data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py#L270), `dataset.map(map_func=tf_io_pipline_tools.augment_for_train,num_parallel_calls=CFG.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS)`[(here)](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/blob/4ec79993cf3d757741c9c88c1036d87bd46e982d/data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py#L273), `dataset.map(map_func=tf_io_pipline_tools.augment_for_test,num_parallel_calls=CFG.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS)`[(here)](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/blob/4ec79993cf3d757741c9c88c1036d87bd46e982d/data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py#L276) and `dataset.map(map_func=tf_io_pipline_tools.normalize,num_parallel_calls=CFG.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS)`[(here)](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/blob/4ec79993cf3d757741c9c88c1036d87bd46e982d/data_provider/data_feed_pipline.py#L278).\r\n\r\nBesides, you need to check the function called in `map()`(e.g., `tf_io_pipline_tools.normalize` called in `dataset.map(map_func=tf_io_pipline_tools.normalize,num_parallel_calls=CFG.TRAIN.CPU_MULTI_PROCESS_NUMS)`) whether to be affected or not to make the changed code work properly. For example, if `tf_io_pipline_tools.normalize` needs data with shape (x, y, z) as its input before fix, it would require data with shape (batch_size, x, y, z).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply. Btw, I am very glad to create a PR to fix it if you are too busy.","closed_by":{"login":"MaybeShewill-CV","id":15725187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzI1MTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15725187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV","html_url":"https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaybeShewill-CV/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MaybeShewill-CV/attentive-gan-derainnet/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
