In your Readme, you say that \"The learning rate setting differs from the original paper. I can't seem to get the model to converge with momentum SGD using an lr of 3e-7 for the conv base and 3e-6 for the dense block.\". Which settings did you use? The defaults in argparser are set to the 3e-7, 3e-6, so that's why I was wondering! \r\n\r\nThank you :) ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yunxiaoshi/Neural-IMage-Assessment/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yunxiaoshi/Neural-IMage-Assessment/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
