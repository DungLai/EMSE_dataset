You can use the following transform to normalize:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nnormalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],\r\n                                 std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot doing this will cause VGG-16 to output the wrong feature maps and you will probably get worse results. If you add this transform you will have to retrain though.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yunxiaoshi/Neural-IMage-Assessment/issues/26/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yunxiaoshi/Neural-IMage-Assessment/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
