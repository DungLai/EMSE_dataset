Why in test.py you want the loaded images to have a specific input size (lines 101-104):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nraw_pil = Image.open(raw_path)\r\ngt_path = os.path.join(gt)\r\ngt_pil = Image.open(gt)\r\nassert raw_pil.size == (1216, 352)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is not required for the training in main.py.\r\nAfterwards I see you crop the images in both codes until they are 1216 x 256 (as stated in your paper) so I do not understand why would it be so important to make sure that the loaded image in test.py has a specific input format (1216, 352) which is not even the one from the KITTI dataset download files (1226 x 370). Is there any insight I am missing?
