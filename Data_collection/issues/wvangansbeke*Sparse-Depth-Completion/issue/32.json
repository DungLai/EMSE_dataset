If I understand the code correctly, you do not use the raw Lidar scans at all, right? So we would have to project the Lidar scans to images if we want to do something like that?\r\n\r\nAlso, we have a handheld Lidar (Intel Realsense L515) that can capture both RGB images and depth images, and we were thinking of trying to feed your code with this data. Do you know if the images (rgb and depth) have to be of the same size for the code to work?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam","closed_by":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
