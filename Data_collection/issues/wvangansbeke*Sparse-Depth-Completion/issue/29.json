In class Metrics of file benchmark_metrics.py, I found this line `self.num = valid_mask.sum().item()`. I think it might be wrong because this is the number of non-zero pixels. I think this variable should be the batch_size and equal to 1 because you use this variable when computing the average value of metrics in file main.py as follows:\r\n`score.update(metric.get_metric(args.metric), metric.num)\r\n score_1.update(metric.get_metric(args.metric_1), metric.num)`.\r\n\r\nAm I understanding correctly? Please correct me if I have misunderstanding something.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKhang Truong.","closed_by":{"login":"wvangansbeke","id":9694230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9694230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
