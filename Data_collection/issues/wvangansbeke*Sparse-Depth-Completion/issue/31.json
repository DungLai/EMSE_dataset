I got the files needed from KITTI, and used your `download_raw_files.sh`, but modified it to only download validation data into `Data/val`. The model you have trained is saved in a folder I created in `Saved`, but I don't know how to send this path to the program. Also, when trying to run I have to supply a `--mod` which I don't know how to format, and I get an error:\r\n```\r\nmain.py: error: argument --mod: invalid choice: '/home/emdkaai/Desktop/Sparse-Depth-Completion/Saved/pretrained/model_best_epoch.pth' (choose from 'mod')\r\n```\r\nCould you give me any suggestions on what to try?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam","closed_by":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
