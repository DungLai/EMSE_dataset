Files in data_depth_annotated.zip are ground truth of depth and files in data_depth_velodyne.zip are raw depth,is my understanding right?\r\n2. Files in data_depth_selection.zip are prepared for us to evaluate model,is my understanding right?\r\n3. I only find RGB images in data_depth_selection.zip.If I want to use RGB images for guidence,where are the corresponding RGB images in the two zip files,data_depth_annotated.zip and data_depth_velodyne.zip.\r\n4. What's the meaning of embedding1,embedding2,embedding3,embedding4?In other words,embedding from ERFNet as input of hourglass network,why?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if you could help me with above confusions.","closed_by":{"login":"ITBoy-China","id":44388327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mzg4MzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44388327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China","html_url":"https://github.com/ITBoy-China","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ITBoy-China/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
