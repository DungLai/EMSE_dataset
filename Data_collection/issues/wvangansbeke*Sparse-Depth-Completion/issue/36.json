In order to downsample the input, I used the function that you provide: `downsample`. Afterwards, I have tested how it predicts depth in the pixels where there is actual LiDAR information in the input and I have got the following results:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nLiDAR depth: 2049.609375 groundtruth depth: 2049.609375 NN depth: 2097.265625\r\nLiDAR depth: 1317.578125 groundtruth depth: 1303.125 NN depth: 729.6875\r\nLiDAR depth: 2034.765625 groundtruth depth: 1994.921875 NN depth: 1766.015625\r\nLiDAR depth: 1038.671875 groundtruth depth: 1038.671875 NN depth: 604.6875\r\nLiDAR depth: 1788.28125 groundtruth depth: 1784.375 NN depth: 527.34375\r\nLiDAR depth: 1769.921875 groundtruth depth: 1740.234375 NN depth: 1535.9375\r\nLiDAR depth: 1423.828125 groundtruth depth: 1423.828125 NN depth: 986.71875\r\nLiDAR depth: 1203.125 groundtruth depth: 1190.625 NN depth: 743.359375\r\nLiDAR depth: 1762.890625 groundtruth depth: 1757.421875 NN depth: 1470.3125\r\nLiDAR depth: 2573.4375 groundtruth depth: 2540.234375 NN depth: 2076.953125\r\nLiDAR depth: 655.078125 groundtruth depth: 655.078125 NN depth: 539.453125\r\nLiDAR depth: 1229.296875 groundtruth depth: 1229.296875 NN depth: 436.71875\r\n```\r\nI have also seen that for the normal LiDAR depth maps, the output is never the depth map's values but very similar ones in the same pixel position:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nLiDAR depth: 1219.53125 groundtruth depth: 1219.53125 NN depth: 1220.3125\r\nLiDAR depth: 2633.203125 groundtruth depth: 2633.203125 NN depth: 2554.296875\r\nLiDAR depth: 1113.671875 groundtruth depth: 1113.671875 NN depth: 1115.625\r\nLiDAR depth: 4438.28125 groundtruth depth: 4438.28125 NN depth: 4425.0\r\nLiDAR depth: 627.734375 groundtruth depth: 618.75 NN depth: 632.03125\r\nLiDAR depth: 1235.15625 groundtruth depth: 1233.984375 NN depth: 1235.546875\r\nLiDAR depth: 1150.390625 groundtruth depth: 1150.390625 NN depth: 1148.4375\r\nLiDAR depth: 2821.484375 groundtruth depth: 2821.484375 NN depth: 2819.140625\r\nLiDAR depth: 1296.484375 groundtruth depth: 1296.484375 NN depth: 1284.765625\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it is an issue due to the lack of information density but I wanted to know if there is any way of improving these results with such a sparse depth information or if retraining with a sparser dataset (creating my own one) would improve the accuracy.\r\nThanks for your help.\r\nBest,\r\nSebasti√°n","closed_by":{"login":"SebsBarbas","id":60349401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ5NDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60349401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas","html_url":"https://github.com/SebsBarbas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebsBarbas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
