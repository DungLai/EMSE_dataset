Regarding the number of samples. \r\n- Can you explain to me what is the purpose of this argument? Are these number of samples to be tested? \r\n\r\nAny help would be highly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you ","closed_by":{"login":"gautamjain1009","id":37597326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTk3MzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37597326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamjain1009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamjain1009/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
