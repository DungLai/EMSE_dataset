I don't understand why confidence(uncertainty) map and guidance map are able to correct mistakes in the ground truth? In a general setting, unguided or guided, I think CNN is able to handle a small amount of error in the ground truth.\r\n\r\n2. How many channels do the guidance map have(one of the global net output)? In the figure it says 1216x256x1, I'm wondering did you try to increase the number of channels, how does them perform?\r\n\r\n3. As for the pretrained ERFNet on cityscape dataset, what is the setting for the pretraining? And have you try the depth completion without pretraining?\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"jiangwei221","id":25207535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjA3NTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25207535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangwei221","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
