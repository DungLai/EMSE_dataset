Then you can easily change the position of the camera to generate the same viewpoint as in the video. So for a point p, you should first compute, D * K<sup>-1</sup> * p, to obtain the coordinate in 3D (in homogeneous coordinates). Next, you can apply a transformation to the obtained point cloud in order to get the desired viewpoint. I just shifted the y-axis.
