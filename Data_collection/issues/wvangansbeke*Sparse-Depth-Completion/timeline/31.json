If you look at [this line](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/blob/master/main.py#L203), you can see it looks for the best_model* in the `saved` directory. So you need to pass the folder where you saved your best model by specifying the `--save_path` flag. (So `Saved` in your case). You shouldn't change `--mod` , because it is used to change the architecture.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/671274484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wvangansbeke","id":9694230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9694230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3638120244,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYzODEyMDI0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/events/3638120244","actor":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-10T10:18:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3638120246,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MzgxMjAyNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/events/3638120246","actor":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-10T10:18:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/671353116","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/31#issuecomment-671353116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/31","id":671353116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTM1MzExNg==","user":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-10T13:26:30Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T13:26:30Z","author_association":"NONE","bod
