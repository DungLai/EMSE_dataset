Can you set a breakpoint at the start of the loop in `test/test.py` and check the filenames. Make sure that the RGB and LiDAR filenames match. Maybe let it finish to check what RMSE you get. If you don't get 802mm rmse, something is still wrong.

Are you sure you calculate the mae correctly? \r\nCan you try downloading the dataset again. Maybe the dataset got corrupted. Also not sure if it has something to do with the fact that you're using windows.\r\n\r\nTo help you further, I will give the exact code and commands I run. You can download the code, model and results as a single zip-file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MxtFLUcmtQ7jOTCOFqzxesFsJDt-2Jpk/view?usp=sharing). First unzip the files. Then change the path to the dataset in `Test/test.sh`. Finally, you only need to run `sh Test/test.sh best`. You can also find my predictions in the directory `Saved/best/results/`.\r\n\r\nHope this
