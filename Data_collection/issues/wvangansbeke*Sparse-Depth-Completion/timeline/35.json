So you should first do:  `state = torch.load('path/to/model)['state_dict']` to get the state dictionary and then `model.load_state_dict(state)` to load the weights. See [this line](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/blob/master/main.py#L190). Also, `Dataparallel` is not needed here. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/701236622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wvangansbeke","id":9694230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9694230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":3823227361,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzgyMzIyNzM2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/events/3823227361","actor":{"login":"zshn25","id":5270999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5270999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25","html_url":"https://github.com/zshn25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T08:13:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3823227366,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4MjMyMjczNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/events/3823227366","actor":{"login":"zshn25","id":5270999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5270999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25","html_url":"https://github.com/zshn25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T08:13:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/701274921","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/35#issuecomment-701274921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/35","id":701274921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTI3NDkyMQ==","user":{"login":"zshn25","id":5270999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzA5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5270999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25","html_url":"https://github.com/zshn25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zshn25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T09:26:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T09:26:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks
