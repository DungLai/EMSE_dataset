Keep in mind that the feature maps for the two modalities are fused (e.g. concatenated) after all. \r\n\r\nIf you want to do the projection yourself, have a look [here](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2/blob/master/kitti_utils.py#L46). \r\n\r\nHope this

you, this is great! We plan on using it both on KITTI and on our own data, and as you say training another model will probably be a great idea for the latter. \r\n\r\nFor KITTI data we would like to use the pretrained model to get output in the form of depth images for a specific data sequence, that is not part of the data that the test.sh or test.py are loading from by default. Would it be sufficient to put this data (images+projected lidar images) in the correct folder that the dataloading is loading from, or will we need something more?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/678208291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MrMixit","id":22906820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22906820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMixit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMixit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/678227606","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/32#issuecomment-678227606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/32","id":678227606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODIyNzYwNg==","user":{"login":"wvangansbeke","id":9694230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9694230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T10:49:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T10:49:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"You should be able to augment the image paths (see [this line](https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/blob/fa31dca6041d2bebd66ea55b259bf054d571571d/Datasets/Kitti_loader.py#L139)) with your own dataset.
