When you change the sparsity, you have to retrain the whole network. The network has to learn how much it can rely on the noisy lidar. When the sparsity is very low, the network can probably learn a simple interpolation/averaging function. When the sparsity is very high, the network will rely more on the RGB image.\r\n\r\nHope this
