It all depends on the receptive field. The global network can detect global changes due to its large receptive field. However, the local network (with a small receptive field) only needs to perform some sort of interpolation. Important to know is that the input LiDAR frame contains local mistakes which are hard to detect with a small network. The global network can inform the local network which LiDAR points seem inconsistent. \r\n\r\n2. You can use more than 1 channel if you want but I don't think it matters that much.\r\n\r\n3. I downloaded a pretrained network which was accessible from the ERFNet github page, but I don't know if it's available anymore. Pretraining worked slightly better in my case though.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nKind regards,\r\nWouter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/479580609/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wvangansbeke","id":9694230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9694230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wvangansbeke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/comments/479653283","html_url":"https://github.com/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/2#issuecomment-479653283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wvangansbeke/Sparse-Depth-Completion/issues/2","id":479653283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTY1MzI4Mw==","user":{"login":"jiangwei221","id":25207535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjA3NTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25207535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangwei221","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangwei221/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T20:49:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T20:49:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the detailed explaination!
