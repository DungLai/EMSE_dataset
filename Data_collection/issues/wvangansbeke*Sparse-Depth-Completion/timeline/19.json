Initially I only used guidance by multiplication with an attention map (=probability), but found out that it is less robust and that differences between a focal MSE and vanilla MSE loss function were now negligible. Be aware that this change will alter the appearance of the confidence maps since fusion takes place at mutliple stages now (see README). \r\n\r\nIn short: if you want the old version, just remove the skip connections to get the original confidence maps.  The results should be similar and you should get a sense of interpretability.
