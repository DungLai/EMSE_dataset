You can explicitly specify the device using the `--device` argument, e.g. `--device cuda`. You can put anything that is accepted by `torch.device` here (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_attributes.html#torch.torch.device). \r\n\r\nIf it does not work anyways, I would guess that the problem is on your side. Check the output of `torch.cuda.is_available())` if Pytorch recognizes your GPU.
