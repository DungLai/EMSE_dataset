this error is likely caused by your images containing grayscale images. A quick fix would be to make sure that your images are in RGB.\r\n\r\nOr if you just want to use grayscale images you can simply expand the dimension of your images after you load them. This happens because ~~PIL Image~~ **numpy** will give you 2 dimension output if it is grayscale image. (e.g. not (64, 64, 1) but (64, 64))\r\n\r\nPlease add comments if there's anything wrong in my comment.
