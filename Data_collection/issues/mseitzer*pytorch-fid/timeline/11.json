some long detective work I found several sources of errors between the TF and Pytorch implementation. It turns out that the Inception model of Pytorch uses different weights and a slightly different model than Tensorflow's Inception. This introduced a significant source of error. I pushed an updated version of the model (see #16), which fixes those errors. \r\n\r\nThe model itself now computes the same results as the TF model when inputting the exact same image. There might be other sources of error (e.g. image interpolation) which could result in the FID score still being slightly different. However, I think the results should now be pretty comparable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/496301411/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/496306900","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/11#issuecomment-496306900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/11","id":496306900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjMwNjkwMA==","user":{"login":"Vermeille","id":1108219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille","html_url":"https://github.com/Vermeille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vermeille/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T21:15:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T21:15:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
