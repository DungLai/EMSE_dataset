Summary\r\nAs per my own experience and Issue #77, I believe that the ability to save an npz file is a significant missing feature to this otherwise great tool! So I went and implemented it! The user can simply specify the `--save-stats` flag and the stats of the first path will be generated and saved in the location of the second path.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* Add the argument `--save-stats` to the argument parser\r\n* Implement `save_fid_stats` using `calcualte_fid_given_paths` as a guide and making use of `np.savez_compressed`\r\n* In `__main__`, if the `--save-stats` flag has been specified, run `save_fid_stats` and exit early. This design makes it clear that the `--save-stats` flag is the option and the original workflow is still the primary workflow.\r\n* Update `README.md` to document the changes\r\n    *  My editor strips trailing whitespace. I believe that this is best practice so I have kept these changes in this PR. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have manually tested the new workflow and the original and they behave exactly as expected. By logical inspection of the changes I've made, I believe no errors will have been introduced, however, I failed to run the included test suite due to an error that is present on master - prior to my changes. The error I am receiving is:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: compute_statistics_of_path() got an unexpected keyword argument 'num_workers'\r\n```\r\nPlease advise how to fix this and I can rerun the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Code formatting\r\nI have done my best to copy the style in which the existing code is written. I could not find a linter that is in use - if there is one, please make me aware of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/80/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/998852706","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/77#issuecomment-998852706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/77","id":998852706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzaGKs47iUhi","user":{"login":"jwblangley","id":14108795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTA4Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14108795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley","html_url":"https://github.com/jwblangley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwblangley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-21T15:05:44Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T15:05:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @liuluping0106 !
