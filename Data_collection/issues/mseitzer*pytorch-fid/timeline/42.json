But, do you think we can still calculate FID score using 2048 dimensions for the samples less than 2048 in either of the two comparable folders(images). I know we might not have the full rank and covariance matrix and some NAN's. But, I'm just wondering if it makes sense to even give it a try?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/686503484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sagarkora","id":43825396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODI1Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43825396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora","html_url":"https://github.com/sagarkora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sagarkora/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/696547757","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/42#issuecomment-696547757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/42","id":696547757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjU0Nzc1Nw==","user":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T07:07:42Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T07:07:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It depends on what you do with the results. _Maybe_ you would be able to compute an approximation to FID using less than 2048 samples, but it's hard to predict how good the quality of this approximation is.
