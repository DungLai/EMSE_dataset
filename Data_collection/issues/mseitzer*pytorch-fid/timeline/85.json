Thus I would first advise first to double check that the images in question really can not be loaded by PIL, e.g. using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimg = Image.open(path).load()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also try adding the following snippet to see if it solves the problem. However, this may silently create padded images, which is not what you want for FID computations.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom PIL import ImageFile\r\nImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/1371946363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}}]
