I will explain what makes me confused.\r\nIf we have 200 number of images(or 2000) to train, and we need to compare the real images and generated images with FID metric. Then I have following problems:\r\n1. Can we calculate the FID with dim 2048? As for this dim, they certainly conclude all features in the training dataset.\r\n2. Are there some relationships between the number of training data set and feature dimension when we calculate the FID? Currently, I think the reason would be overfitting if we use the small data set.
