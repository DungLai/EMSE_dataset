According to your patch, they do not use the correct Inception code. Maybe the official weight of Pytorch is better for evaluation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/498578147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AtlantixJJ","id":20163080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTYzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20163080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AtlantixJJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtlantixJJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2387346244,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM4NzM0NjI0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/events/2387346244","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T08:38:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2387346249,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzODczNDYyNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/events/2387346249","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-04T08:38:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/498953982","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/17#issuecomment-498953982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/17","id":498953982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODk1Mzk4Mg==","user":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T06:21:32Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T06:21:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Well, I don't think there is much choice here. The authors of FID chose this version of Inception, and to stay comparable, everyone has to use this version now. I guess the FID authors just took the same model Inception score uses: https://github.com/openai/improved-gan/blob/master/inception_score/model.py\r\n\r\nAlso, this Inception model is not \"wrong\", it just does not directly correspond to the paper. Its feature maps should still contain what the authors of FID and Inception scores want to measure.\r\n\r\nBut I *do* think it is a bit concerning that FID score gives wildly different results if you use a different version of Inception.

that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/498953982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/544174697","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/17#issuecomment-544174697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/17","id":544174697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDE3NDY5Nw==","user":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-19T17:15:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T17:15:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Fixed
