hi, I know it's late, but I'm trying to implement a more flexible FID version based on your code. I knew that you scale the input from [0,1] to [-1,1] but as I know, the Inception model expects the input image is scaled by ImageNet normalized factor which are `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. Therefore, it will be better if we modify the transform when we read data.
