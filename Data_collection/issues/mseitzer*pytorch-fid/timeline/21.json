for you reply.\r\nThe reason for this issue is not just what I said. After debuging, I found it is because the image size is not same. All matplotlib, imageio and even skimage work! Hence, I rewrite it into pytorch ImageFolder and doing the data preprocessing in the pytorch way. The preprocess includes the resize. \r\nBy the way, I find there are only options for using gpu or not. So I change it to be able to select specific device.  \r\nI can pull the modified version to yours, if you wish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/544219053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JiaBob","id":18398440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk4NDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18398440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaBob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaBob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/581038500","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/21#issuecomment-581038500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/21","id":581038500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTAzODUwMA==","user":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-01T15:04:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T15:04:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thank you, but there is already a PR pending for including Pytorch-style data loading.
