However, it is unclear how FID behaves in this case, as the original Inception network was probably not trained on grayscale images. \r\n\r\nAlso, I would advise against computing a FID score on Mnist. FID score was designed to work on larger images of natural scenes, not on 28x28 images of handwritten digits. I am guessing that the numbers you would get from that are pretty meaningless and do not reflect human judgement of quality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/492527995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2342264766,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM0MjI2NDc2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/events/2342264766","actor":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-15T06:53:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/comments/571538563","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/12#issuecomment-571538563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/12","id":571538563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTUzODU2Mw==","user":{"login":"saurabheights","id":11634769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM0NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11634769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights","html_url":"https://github.com/saurabheights","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabheights/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T10:57:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T10:57:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I added more info here :- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57183647/ \r\nFYI: Thanks for your repo.
