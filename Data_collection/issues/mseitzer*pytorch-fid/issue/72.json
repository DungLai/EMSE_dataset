A small bug I noticed is that \r\nhttps://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/blob/d042ab8a9f8e4b388c21bc7b38d9599c5fbcfe7b/setup.py#L25\r\nwill lead to an error in windows as windows uses \\ instead of / in pathing. \r\nI would like to very use this metric for testing my own implementation of FID in pytorch ignite. But circle-ci based tests seem to be failing because of it. \r\n\r\nA possible solution would be to use os module for generating path,\r\nCode looks similar to this.\r\n```\r\nimport os.path\r\ndata_folder = os.path.join(\"source_data\", \"text_files\")\r\nfile_to_open = os.path.join(data_folder, \"raw_data.txt\")\r\nf = open(file_to_open)\r\nprint(f.read())\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
