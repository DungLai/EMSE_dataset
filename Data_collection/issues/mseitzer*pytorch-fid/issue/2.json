It was really easy to follow.\r\nI was working on Similar areas, where I need to check the quality of the Image Generated by the GANs for a CIFAR10/100 dataset.\r\n\r\nI had a small query though. When I load the Inception model, I find the pretrained model is based on an Imagenet Dataset. Now supposing that I am doing a task based on CIFAR10 Dataset on GAN. How can I use the model for Imagenet since CIFAR10 has a size of 32x32 and number of classes is 10, where as in Imagenet it is about 224x224 and classes are 1000.\r\n\r\nDo I need to change anything while calculating IS and FID for dataset such as CIFAR10/100 or CelebA?\r\nAny comments or suggestion would be really appreciated!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNitin Bansal","closed_by":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
