Nevertheless `fid_score.py` imports this function. This will fail unless the user downgrades their SciPy. \r\n\r\n## Potential solutions\r\nSciPy recommends using `imageio.imread` instead. Another alternative is `np.asarray(PIL.Image.open(...))`. If you have a preference for which dependency you'd like to add, I will submit a PR. \r\n\r\nAll best,\r\nJon","closed_by":{"login":"mseitzer","id":16725193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI1MTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16725193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mseitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseitzer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/25/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
