Now if I want to train the GAN to generate the COCO alike datasets, then can I use the pretrained Inception net for that? \r\n\r\nLogically, it should not be the case as the backbone training is itself very different from COCO like datasets. \r\n\r\nAlso, instead of InceptionNet, can I take any backbone trained on object detection on COCO or VOC and then take that as my network for the evaluation of the same?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/issues/76/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
