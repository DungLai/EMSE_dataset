After selecting the best model after epoch, will it be effective to continue training? ? Personal feelings will be over-fitting, and the evaluation coefficient will only get lower and lower, so how to explain it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aditya-vora/FCHD-Fully-Convolutional-Head-Detector/issues/comments/494714088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KelvinHuang666","id":42311753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzExNzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42311753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666","html_url":"https://github.com/KelvinHuang666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KelvinHuang666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aditya-vora/FCHD-Fully-Convolutional-Head-Detector/issues/comments/546164191","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya-vora/FCHD-Fully-Convolutional-Head-Detector/issues/36#issuecomment-546164191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aditya-vora/FCHD-Fully-Convolutional-Head-Detector/issues/36","id":546164191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjE2NDE5MQ==","user":{"login":"zzy0724","id":38041265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDQxMjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38041265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724","html_url":"https://github.com/zzy0724","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzy0724/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T01:34:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T01:34:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"你好，请问你训练的时候有遇到这个错误吗？OSError:
