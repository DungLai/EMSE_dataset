In that case you want to keep everything as is, except modify\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/blob/master/Evaluate.py#L73\r\n\r\nwhere the Wave-U-Net output gets resampled - you can change that so it always gets resampled to 12KHz, and then feed it into your model. Note that the code here actually starts a new TF session each time though - which if you are training your own model seems unnecessary, so you might want to remove that stuff too so both models are in the same persistent session","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/444138482/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/444143239","html_url":"https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/17#issuecomment-444143239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/17","id":444143239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDE0MzIzOQ==","user":{"login":"loretoparisi","id":163333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi","html_url":"https://github.com/loretoparisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-04T15:35:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T15:35:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your help!
