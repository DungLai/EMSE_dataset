The separation is a bit worse there than for vocals only, maybe due to a smaller training dataset plus restricted network capacity. But I could train a bigger version and see if I can even surpass the paper results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/418701700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/418706023","html_url":"https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/2#issuecomment-418706023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/2","id":418706023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODcwNjAyMw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T12:05:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T19:38:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If possible, a FLAC writer would be nice since the results would remain lossless (and a bit smaller than a standard WAV).\r\n\r\nWell, the results I hear on the site with the examples are very good.

Should be fairly easy to append your own conversion program to mine so that it automatically is converted.\r\n\r\nThe results have a low-pass filter sound because the pretrained model works on 22KHz audio, meaning high frequencies are ignored. But you can easily change this and train 44KHz CD-quality separators by changing the expected_sr setting in Config.py before starting to train :)\r\n\r\nGood that you're happy with the results.
