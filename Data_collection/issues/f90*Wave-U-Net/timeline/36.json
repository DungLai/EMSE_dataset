Since the delay is just the amount of context the net needs on the right  hand side + the target output window size  (in my works ~6 sec). \r\n\r\nDownside is that the performance would likely degrade since you are also not allowing the network to look far into the past for prediction. But this would not require adapting the code at all basically.\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to show the network as target outputs not the source signal at the CENTRE of the input excerpt, but rather the source signal somewhat to the right of the centre, which would reduce delay during prediction, and also changing the cropping in the crop-and-concat operation to retain more of the right-most features, so you are essentially asking it to predict the source activity at the later part of the input. This also doesn't require too much code change but I am not sure how well it will predict in this setting, since now it needs to extract features more \"asymmetrically\". Might still work though!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/524976241/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2593934603,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1OTM5MzQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/events/2593934603","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-29T13:12:23Z","label":{"name":"feature","color":"a2eeef"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2593934604,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1OTM5MzQ2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/events/2593934604","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-29T13:12:23Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/530461889","html_url":"https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/36#issuecomment-530461889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/36","id":530461889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDQ2MTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-11T16:36:17Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:36:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closing
