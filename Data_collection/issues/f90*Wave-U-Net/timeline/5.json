Are you not able to install Python 2 on your Windows system? That would mean you can fulfill the requirements for my code (since it is written in Python 2) plus you could maybe install scikits.audiolab. If you stay with Python 3, that may work, but you might have to convert some parts of the code to Python 3 beforehand. I don't expect there to be many changes necessary and there is also conversion tools out there (2to3.py if I remember). But still, potentially errors are introduced in this process.\r\n\r\n2. If you cannot fulfill scikits.audiolab requirement, and you don't need to read in any aiff or TIMIT data for training the model (so if you just want to use pre-trained models you are definitely fine, or if you want to use only MUSDB and CCMixter datasets), you can remove the scikits.audiolab import statement which only occurs here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/blob/master/Metadata.py#L4\r\n\r\nAnd then in the ```get_audio_metadata``` function, you would simply remove the if clause related to aiff or sphereType files. So it would probably end up being:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_audio_metadata(audioPath, sphereType=False):\r\n    '''\r\n    Returns sampling rate, number of channels and duration of an audio file\r\n    :param audioPath: \r\n    :param sphereType: \r\n    :return: \r\n    '''\r\n    ext = os.path.splitext(audioPath)[1][1:].lower()\r\n    if ext==\"mp3\": # Use ffmpeg/ffprobe\r\n        sr, channels, duration = get_mp3_metadata(audioPath)\r\n    else:\r\n        snd_file = SoundFile(audioPath, mode='r')\r\n        inf = snd_file._info\r\n        sr = inf.samplerate\r\n        channels = inf.channels\r\n        duration = float(inf.frames) / float(inf.samplerate)\r\n    return int(sr), int(channels), float(duration)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can try that and then see if it works!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/435701525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/435722954","html_url":"https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/5#issuecomment-435722954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/5","id":435722954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTcyMjk1NA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T00:22:33Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T00:22:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Well
