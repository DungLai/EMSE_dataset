Is it the same with the singing voice separation models?\r\n\r\nFor 2), you are right that the ```compute_mean_metrics``` function can be used to compute the results. It is meant to be used as standalone function, so you should be able to do\r\n```\r\nimport Evaluate\r\nEvaluate.compute_mean_metrics(PATH_TO_JSONS)\r\n```\r\nfrom a Python console, where PATH_TO_JSONS is simply the path to the folder containing all the JSON files you want to evaluate, so that should be 50 (or 51 including test.json) files, one for each song. For details on the other parameters refer to the documentation of the ```compute_mean_metrics``` function.\r\n\r\n```draw_violin_sdr``` can be used with the same json path parameter to directly plot the distribution of SDR values so it builds on the other function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/496213521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/comments/496341713","html_url":"https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/30#issuecomment-496341713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/30","id":496341713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjM0MTcxMw==","user":{"login":"Wangbin1125","id":50995004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTk1MDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50995004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125","html_url":"https://github.com/Wangbin1125","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wangbin1125/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T02:24:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T02:24:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@f90
