Any reason for that? In my CNN I have a resampling of 12KHz of the input, so can I do apply this resampling?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"loretoparisi","id":163333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi","html_url":"https://github.com/loretoparisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loretoparisi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
