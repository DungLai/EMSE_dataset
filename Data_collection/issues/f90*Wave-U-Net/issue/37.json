After reading through your paper and tried your codes, I would say this is an evaluation of audio source separation methods, especially for music and vocal separation. How comes you are so smart to come up with this idea that using the entire time domain input for training (If I am not misunderstanding your method) that is able to give smoother and more natural audio outputs, compared to those spectrum/STFT based methods. The sound quality (which is a high demand for the music industry) of your prediction is incredibly high, and the accuracy is decent considering you are only using a very very small dataset for training. Excellent job!!\r\n\r\nSo back to my question. I am really interested in your model and would expect huge improvements with larger training datasets. However, as indicated in your paper, you are using K number of sources for prediction output, so K=2 for vocal separation (if I am not wrong), which requires both accompaniment and clean vocal datasets for training. While accompaniment music is easy to find but clean vocals are not, so this makes it harder to train on a larger dataset. So I am asking, let's say, if I am only interested in the prediction of accompaniment music, is your model able to predict K=1 output which is exactly the accompaniment prediction I want, that I can apply to a large accompaniment training set.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!","closed_by":{"login":"f90","id":23065103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23065103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90","html_url":"https://github.com/f90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
