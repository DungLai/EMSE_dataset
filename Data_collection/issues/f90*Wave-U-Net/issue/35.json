But now I want to try to run the codes on multiple GPUs, but I found that I can't run directly. So I decided to modify the codes, but only to find that TensorFlow is not good for multi-GPUs support. Since you are the person who wrote these codes, I wonder if you could change the code to run on multiple GPUs? Thanks again.","closed_by":{"login":"Tinglok","id":32794938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzk0OTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32794938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok","html_url":"https://github.com/Tinglok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tinglok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
