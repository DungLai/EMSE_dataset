It might probably be difference in training routine or data augmentation or some subtle difference in architecture of model written in `Lua-Torch` or `Pytorch`. \r\nI will hopefully try to train it again sometime in future but it doesn't seem possible currently due to other commitments. Feel free to try to train it on your own!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Naman-ntc/Pytorch-Human-Pose-Estimation/issues/comments/497073562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Naman-ntc","id":23135406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTM1NDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23135406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc","html_url":"https://github.com/Naman-ntc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2376177371,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM3NjE3NzM3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Naman-ntc/Pytorch-Human-Pose-Estimation/issues/events/2376177371","actor":{"login":"Naman-ntc","id":23135406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTM1NDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23135406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc","html_url":"https://github.com/Naman-ntc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naman-ntc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-29T19:17:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
