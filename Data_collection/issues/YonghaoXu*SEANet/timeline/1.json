I can't explain it very scientifically, but I am willing to share my intuitive guess. \r\nUsually, an ensemble model of multiple base networks would yield better predictions than a base network does, since the ensemble model shows more robustness towards noise. In our case, the teacher network is updated with the historical parameters from the student network. It thereby takes the role of ensemble model, and its predictions on the target-domain images are supposed to be closer to the ground-truth, theoretically. Therefore, a natural idea is to adopt the ensemble predictions as the pseudo labels to assist the training of the student network. \r\nIn the practical training phase, since there is no additional restriction for the predictions of the teacher network, the correctness of these pseudo labels can not be always guaranteed, resulting in unstable performance at some iterations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/comments/476099454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YonghaoXu","id":20435351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDM1MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20435351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu","html_url":"https://github.com/YonghaoXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/comments/476132237","html_url":"https://github.com/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/1#issuecomment-476132237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/1","id":476132237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjEzMjIzNw==","user":{"login":"RoyalVane","id":6834885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane","html_url":"https://github.com/RoyalVane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoyalVane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-25T10:16:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T10:16:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your detailed explaination!

As discussed with Yawei, although there is no specific design to guarantee that the teacher network would yield more accurate predictions, our observation is the EMA strategy itself would help to bring the knowledge of ensemble learning, which is beneficial to the domain adaptation. \r\n\r\nFor your second question, I'm not sure if your task is unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation or just basic image classification. For the semantic segmentation case, you can check one related work \"Self-ensembling with gan-based data augmentation for domain adaptation in semantic segmentation\" in ICCV 2019, where the authors provide the testing mIoUs for both the student network and the teacher network at different iterations. You may find that the teacher network would generally outperform the student network most of the time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/comments/1200901686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YonghaoXu","id":20435351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDM1MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20435351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu","html_url":"https://github.com/YonghaoXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YonghaoXu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":7099395157,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCef69s4ZUCcEzwAAAAGnKCxV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/events/7099395157","actor":{"login":"lauraset","id":39206462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjA2NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39206462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset","html_url":"https://github.com/lauraset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-01T08:43:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7099395161,"node_id":"SE_lADOCef69s4ZUCcEzwAAAAGnKCxZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/events/7099395161","actor":{"login":"lauraset","id":39206462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjA2NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39206462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset","html_url":"https://github.com/lauraset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-01T08:43:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/comments/1201194286","html_url":"https://github.com/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/1#issuecomment-1201194286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/YonghaoXu/SEANet/issues/1","id":1201194286,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCef69s5HmMUu","user":{"login":"lauraset","id":39206462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjA2NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39206462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset","html_url":"https://github.com/lauraset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lauraset/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T13:19:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T13:19:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, @YonghaoXu.
