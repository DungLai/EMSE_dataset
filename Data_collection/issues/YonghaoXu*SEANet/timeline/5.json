Ideally, with a suitable attention threshold $\\tau_{att}$, we can filter out pixels with small domain gaps and focus more on the noteworthy regions. Figure 4 in the paper provides an intuitional visualization about the learned attention maps. It can be observed that the road category usually attracts more attention compared to the sky regions. This phenomenon is identical to the detailed per-class accuracy in Table 2, where the IoU metric of the road and sky is 31.9 and 58.9 with NoAdapt method, respectively, while it increases to 85.2 and 74.9 after the adaptation.\r\n\r\nSince there is no specific consideration on different categories in this framework, the current attention learning may also filter out regions with large domain gaps for some categories by mistake.
