So maybe my question is not quite related to your repository. \r\nI want to ask if I have a point cloud(Nx3), a rotation matrix(3x3) and translation matrix(1x3). How could I get the point cloud after the transformation(rotation and translationâ†’4X4)? \r\nFor rotation, I guess just multiply with the matrix? And how about translation?\r\nYour help will be highly appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"sunnyHelen","id":28101548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAxNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28101548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen","html_url":"https://github.com/sunnyHelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
