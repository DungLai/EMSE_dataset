I have not tried the performance of SO-Net under the rotating point cloud yet. But I believe the absence of rotation augmentation hurts. \r\n\r\nAny discussions could be helpful.","closed_by":{"login":"usherbob","id":22768647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzY4NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22768647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob","html_url":"https://github.com/usherbob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
