Why do you implement it with cuda? Does it speed up a lot?\r\nAppreciated if you can reply.","closed_by":{"login":"zeal-github","id":40826585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODI2NTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40826585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github","html_url":"https://github.com/zeal-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeal-github/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
