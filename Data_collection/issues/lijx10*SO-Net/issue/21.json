But I still have some questions about testing the model and get the result on SHREC2016 retrieval task. I have run test.py and get those .txt files, also I have downloaded the evaluation files from the website, then what should I do next? Can I directly run the node js file as described in its ReadMe file as \"./evaluate.js path/to/dir/with/results/methodName/\"? And the path is the directory where I save the folders for all the models and it's retrieval results right?\r\nLooking forward to your reply!","closed_by":{"login":"Wuziyi616","id":37072215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDcyMjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37072215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616","html_url":"https://github.com/Wuziyi616","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wuziyi616/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
