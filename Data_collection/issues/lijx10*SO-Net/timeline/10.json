The function `idx2multi` converts an idx into (i, j) coordinate. Take an example that a grid is 3x5, idx 0 is (0, 0), idx 4 is (0, 4), idx 5 is (1, 0). It is row-major.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if it is column major, it is `(i // self.rows, i % self.rows)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/442387410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1994411843,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk5NDQxMTg0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/events/1994411843","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-29T07:05:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
