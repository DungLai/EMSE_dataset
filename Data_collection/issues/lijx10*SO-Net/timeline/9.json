For example, after performing nearest neighbor search we get the update vector $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ for a node of coordinate (i, j). We need to update node (i, j) and its neighbors like (i-1, j), (i, j+1), etc. The further a neighbor is, the weaker the update effect is. The weighting is actually a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution centered at (i, j). `init_weighting_matrix` stores that Gaussian distribution. Therefore, `init_weighting_matrix` is MxHxW.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what you mean 3xHxW is the dimension of the SOM, whose initial value is `self.node_init_value` acquired by a potential field algorithm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/442333867/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1994411837,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk5NDQxMTgzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/events/1994411837","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-29T07:05:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
