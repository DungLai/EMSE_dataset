Less params.** \r\n1.1 Take an example that the feature vector is size 1024, and we want to reconstruct 1024 points. \r\n- FC: **Assume that the number of neurons are non-increasing.** The first layer is at least 1024 -> 3*1024 (each point has x,y,z coordinates). That is param amount: 1024*3*1024. In the following layers, the number of params will be 3*1024*3*1024.\r\n- deconv: the first layer, the convolution param amount: 1024*3*3*1024. But in the following layers, the number of params are decreasing.\r\n- This effect is more obvious if we are reconstructing 5000 points. Each layer of FC takes at least 3*5000*3*5000, which is huge. But for deconv, the we have similar number of params as in the case of reconstructing 1024 points.\r\n- That is, deconv is much more scalable.\r\n- Of course, we don't have to **assume that the number of neurons are non-increasing** for FC. In this case, the number of params depends on how to implement FC/deconv. It is meaning less to make absolute comparison.\r\n\r\n2. **Deconv has better performance**\r\n- In experiments, reconstructing large number points with FC will result in disappointing performance.\r\n- In real objects / scenes, each point is not totally independent to another point. Hence it is not necessary to use FC. Deconv is more suitable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/478308597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2350731120,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM1MDczMTEyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/events/2350731120","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-18T01:53:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
