The performance of SO-Net or any other method will be very bad if tested with rotated objects but trained without rotation augmentation. Therefore, one has to train the model with rotation augmentation if rotated objects will be forwarded into the network. Training with rotation augmentation will lead to slight performance drop.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/559391501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx-nutonomy","id":45551802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTUxODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45551802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx-nutonomy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx-nutonomy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2838555785,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgzODU1NTc4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/events/2838555785","actor":{"login":"usherbob","id":22768647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzY4NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22768647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob","html_url":"https://github.com/usherbob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/usherbob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-28T11:01:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
