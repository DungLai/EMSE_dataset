The returned `som_knn_I` is later used in the `KNNModule` in `models/network.py`. You may set `precomputed_knn_I=None` when calling the forward function of `KNNModule`. Hence, the Faiss dependence can be removed for classification and segmentation.\r\n- Computing the Chamfer distance in Autoencoder. The nearest neighbor search can be easily replaced with brute-force searching. However, brute-force search is much slower than using Faiss.\r\n\r\n### numba\r\nIt is a lot more complicated to remove the dependence on numba. There are customized cuda functions in `models/operations.py`, including functions to create the SOM feature map. An option is to rewrite those functions with C language with cuda support, and import it to python.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/416174928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1819688820,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgxOTY4ODgyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/events/1819688820","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-31T03:43:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
