In the matlab syntax, a point can be represented as p = [x, y, z, 1]. The rotation R (3x3 matrix) and translation t (3x1 matrix) can be represented by a transformation matrix G = [R, t; 0, 1], where the '0' is a 1x3 zero matrix. Then the point p can be transformed by G * p.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/529738070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lijx10","id":12218345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE4MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12218345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijx10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/comments/529767288","html_url":"https://github.com/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/26#issuecomment-529767288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lijx10/SO-Net/issues/26","id":529767288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTc2NzI4OA==","user":{"login":"sunnyHelen","id":28101548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTAxNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28101548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen","html_url":"https://github.com/sunnyHelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunnyHelen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T04:45:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T04:45:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot with your apply.
