Currently, we don’t support optimizing both a Keras `optimizer` object and its parameters at the same time. As you say, optimizing nested parameters in general currently isn’t supported. However the Keras `optimizer`s are specifically problematic because they each have different parameters. \r\n\r\nWhile all optimizers do have an `lr` kwarg, some have other kwargs that different optimizers don’t have. For example, an attempt to search through optimizers “sgd” and “rmsprop”, as well as `momentum` gets weird because `RMSprop` doesn’t have a `momentum` kwarg. Furthermore, many optimizers have different default `lr` values. \r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, this could probably be addressed by adding support for nested/conditional hyperparameter optimization, but I still think it gets messy rather quickly in the case of Keras optimizers. This messiness is compounded when we consider that HH is going to automatically read all of our old Experiments and try to match them with the new search space to jump-start optimization. All the old Experiment results, of course, will also have the default values for hyperparameters that weren’t explicitly given. \r\n\r\nAll that said, I would very much like to support nested/conditional dimensions… \r\n\r\nCould you please clarify what you mean by,\r\n\r\n> This way i can return optimizers that can’t be called by name (Ie. Adamax or Nadam)\r\n\r\nIf you’re referring to using `Categorical` on the string names of optimizers, then “adamax” and “nadam” do work; however, I think I may have misunderstood.\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n> The problem is i don’t think you can call any non-native function inside your build_fn…\r\n\r\nThat’s correct. I won’t bore you with all the technical details, but HH actually rewrites the Keras `build_fn` its given before evaluating it, and this currently leaves out any non-native or non-Keras stuff, which is the reason for the NameError you’re getting. \r\n\r\nDoing this may seem unnecessarily complicated, but the reason for it is to enable providing search dimensions directly to Keras layers. Otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to do something like `Dense(Integer(50, 150))` because `Dense` is expecting a native Python `int`, not an `Integer` instance, as its first argument. \r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas or would actually like some more technical details, I’d be more than happy to discuss it further, but that’s the “short” answer to why you’re getting that NameError.\r\n\r\nYour wrapper function approach does seem really interesting, though, and I’m trying to figure out how we could integrate it into HH to support nested/conditional dimensions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/520104744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/523030419","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/181#issuecomment-523030419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/181","id":523030419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzAzMDQxOQ==","user":{"login":"ben-arnao","id":8053809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTM4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8053809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-arnao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T14:04:41Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T14:04:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`If you’re referring to using Categorical on the string names of optimizers, then “adamax” and “nadam” do work; however, I think I may have misunderstood.`\r\n\r\nadamax and nadam are callable by name?
