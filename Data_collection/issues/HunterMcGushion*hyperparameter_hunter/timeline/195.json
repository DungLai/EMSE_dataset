You make an excellent point, and I think it'd be a good idea to add a section in the README to clarify that search ranges are specified with `Real`, `Integer` and `Categorical`. For now, I'd like to keep the names as-is, unless others also feel that the naming is confusing. I think that in the space of hyperparameter optimization, the names are fairly appropriate, especially since they were taken verbatim from the Scikit-Optimize project. Also, I'd prefer to keep the names shorter. However, I really appreciate your feedback on the names, and I'm certainly open to further discussion if you still disagree. I think additional documentation (like you added in PR #196) would go a long way--especially if it's in a prominent place like the README. \r\n\r\nI'll keep discussion on PR #196 in its comment section. \r\n\r\nTurning to your question on using HH to only do hyperparameter search, could you elaborate a bit? Are you trying to use the OptPros without relying on `Environment` and `CVExperiment`, and bypassing the automatic Experiment result matching that goes along with them? Or do you simply want to add some custom functionality as with [`lambda_callback`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/hyperparameter_hunter.html#hyperparameter_hunter.lambda_callback)?
