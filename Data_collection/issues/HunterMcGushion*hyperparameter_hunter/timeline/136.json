Unfortunately, for now, HyperparameterHunter doesn’t handle automatically loading big datasets in batches.\r\n\r\nI would absolutely love to add support for this, but my todo list is getting quite long, and I’m completely focused on finalizing v3.0.0 at the moment. So I fear it may be a while unless you (or someone following this issue) is willing to work with me on a solution or submit a PR.\r\n\r\nIf your dataset isn’t publicly available, can you refer me to a large dataset I can use for testing?\r\n\r\nForgive me if this is a silly question, as I’m quite unfamiliar with processing big data, but is it possible for you to use [`lambda_callback`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/hyperparameter_hunter.callbacks.html#hyperparameter_hunter.callbacks.bases.lambda_callback) to build a custom callback that handles loading and unloading your dataset batches? I really have no idea if this will work, but I do know that `lambda_callback` is deceptively powerful and very useful, since it gets injected directly into the parent classes of `CVExperiment`. If you’re interested in checking out `lambda_callback`, let me know and I’d be happy to go into more detail on the other callback/data features in HyperparameterHunter that might help solve this problem. \r\n\r\nThanks again for raising this issue. Until we find a solution, I'd like to keep it open to see how many others have the same problem and want to help fix it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/500100426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2398800480,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5ODgwMDQ4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2398800480","actor":{"login":"Utayaki","id":43102733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTAyNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43102733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki","html_url":"https://github.com/Utayaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T06:31:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2398800482,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTg4MDA0ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2398800482","actor":{"login":"Utayaki","id":43102733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTAyNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43102733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki","html_url":"https://github.com/Utayaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-08T06:31:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/502400912","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/136#issuecomment-502400912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/136","id":502400912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjQwMDkxMg==","user":{"login":"Utayaki","id":43102733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTAyNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43102733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki","html_url":"https://github.com/Utayaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utayaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-15T21:32:25Z","updated_at":"2019-06-15T

worries! Aside from the documentation, which you've already seen, I'd recommend a few other resources: \r\n1. [lambda_callback_example.py](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/examples/advanced_examples/lambda_callback_example.py) - Despite being in \"advanced_examples\", this is actually a very simple logging example, but it illustrates how to provide `lambda_callback` to `Environment`, so it can be used by `CVExperiment` and Optimization Protocols\r\n2. [callbacks/recipes.py](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/hyperparameter_hunter/callbacks/recipes.py) - These are actual implementations of `lambda_callback`. Documentation for these functions is pretty excessive, so if it seems daunting at first, try minimizing the docstrings. Most of the functions are only a couple of lines\r\n3. The other two still only scratch the surface, because really every callback in the [`callbacks` module](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/tree/master/hyperparameter_hunter/callbacks) can be expressed as a `lambda_callback`, but they bypass it by inheriting directly from [`BaseCallback`](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/037c649c48213252aa293f93915596a203a79753/hyperparameter_hunter/callbacks/bases.py#L37) - You can (and probably want to) do the same thing\r\n\r\nFor an example of how to implement your own `BaseCallback` descendant, I build one for testing the `wranglers.predictors` [here](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/037c649c48213252aa293f93915596a203a79753/tests/test_callbacks/test_predictors.py#L37). Then the two test functions at the end of the same module ([first test](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/037c649c48213252aa293f93915596a203a79753/tests/test_callbacks/test_predictors.py#L150), and [second test](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/037c649c48213252aa293f93915596a203a79753/tests/test_callbacks/test_predictors.py#L191)) both use the callback class defined above. Note that these two functions don't use `Environment`'s [`experiment_callbacks`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_essentials.html#environment) parameter. However, despite the parameter's documented type of `LambdaCallback`, it's perfectly happy with any descendant of `BaseCallback`. \r\n- *Note: You can also use the lightly-documented [`G.priority_callbacks`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/hyperparameter_hunter.html#hyperparameter_hunter.settings.G) used by the two test functions to push your callback directly to the front of the Experiment's MRO, but that's not the \"officially recommended\" way to do it - Unless it's necessary*\r\n\r\nI think it's worth mentioning that the callbacks defined for the library in the [`callbacks` module](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/tree/master/hyperparameter_hunter/callbacks) are actual critical components of `CVExperiment`. Callbacks in HyperparameterHunter aren't just extra things added as an afterthought. They're absolutely central to Experiments, which is why they are dynamically selected and used to define an Experiment by [`ExperimentMeta`](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/hyperparameter_hunter/experiment_core.py). LambdaCallbacks are designed and intended to be used in the same way. They're not limited to performing \"extra\" tasks, although they can certainly do that. They exist to enable serious customization of the entire Experiment - Hopefully, so people can add the functionality they need that I couldn't anticipate. \r\n\r\nAlso note that you probably don't need to worry about the `ExperimentMeta` linked above, since metaclasses are sometimes considered Python \"black magic\". However, it may be worthwhile to see for yourself that `ExperimentMeta` is the bridge between all of the `callbacks` and `CVExperiment`. It literally just picks which callbacks the Experiment needs to inherit and drops them in.\r\n\r\nSorry about that wall of text. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask here. I'm more than happy to help however I can! \r\n\r\nEdit: If you're still using hyperparameter_hunter v2.2.0 (or lower), you should consider switching to the most recent [v3.0.0 alpha build](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/releases). 3.0.0 completely overhauls how datasets are handled via the `callbacks.wranglers` and `data` modules, so any callbacks dealing with data in v2.0.0 would need to be updated anyway.

However I have never worked with callback functions, thus I don't know, how to use it. \r\nSo, please, tell me if I wrong at some point.\r\nAs I understood:\r\n- I.To use lambda_callback works with functions, so, I need to write a code that will load data gradually\r\n- II. There are plural options of `lambda_callback`, which define, when a function should call. And I need to find the one, that will load data every iteration in Experiment. From that point, `\"on_repetition_start\"` is the most suitable one.\r\n-III After that I should write down the function that will  `return lambda_callback(on_repetition_start=load_data)` in the `experiment_callbacks` line.\r\n\r\nThat's a decision I came up with, when I was reading your examples.

that sounds about right if you're using the `lambda_callback` function, rather than subclassing `BaseCallback`. To clarify on your second point, you can use more than one of the callback functions. However, `on _repetition_start` (or maybe `on_fold_start`) does seem to be the most suitable in this situation. Also, you'll probably want to initialize your `Environment` with the same `train_dataset` batch every time. \r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not sure how this will work out, but feel free to post code here, or to fork the repo and create a new branch, so we can discuss it more easily.

I’m sorry, but after looking into it a bit, I’ve just realized that this will require changes to `models.Model` as well. I have no idea how I missed that. So this can’t be done with just a `lambda_callback`. I’m sorry for sending you in the wrong direction. I am still very much interested in solving this problem, though.
