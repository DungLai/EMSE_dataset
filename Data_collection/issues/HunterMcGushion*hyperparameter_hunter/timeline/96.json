Thank you very much for setting up such a clear example! I have a few questions that are going to sound stupid, but I need to ask just to make sure I understand what you need since I haven’t worked with multiple regression before:\r\n\r\n1. The prediction files for multiple regression problems should contain the predictions for ALL target columns, correct? In your first example, that would be [“y1”, “y2”, “y3”, “y4”]\r\n2. Regarding your scaling with `StandardScaler`, do you envision doing this to all of the data before providing it to HyperparameterHunter? Or should this be a preprocessing step performed by HyperparameterHunter, during cross-validation, for example?\r\n3. Am I correct in saying that you need the following to be supported in HyperparameterHunter:\r\n    1. Multiple `target_column`s for regression (this is already supported, but only tested for multi-classification)\r\n    2. Prediction files that contain predictions for all of the `target_column`s (also only tested for multi-classification)\r\n    3. Some way to work with `sklearn.multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`\r\n        - Is `MultiOutputRegressor` strictly being used because `SVR` and `XGBRegressor` don’t offer native support for multiple targets?

Or should this be a preprocessing step performed by HyperparameterHunter, during cross-validation, for example?\r\n\r\nFor regression, `StandardScale` (mean set to zero all elements scaled to have std = 1.0) and or equivalent is always necessary. Think of it this way, for regression accuracy is always some kind of distance between all predicted points and their true locations (in target space).  If our data and model was about astronomy then our `MSE` might be 1.5 light years.  Is this a good model? How does it compare to some required level of accuracy.  To get at that question we need need to scale.  \r\n\r\nAlso, most fancier models (keras, tensorflow, ...) absolutely require scaling in order to work correctly. This is sometimes hidden or implicit in classification problems - for example `MNIST` images are turned to gray-scale where all pixels will then be between 0.0 and 1.0 and the mean will be around 0.5 - not exactly standard but close enough\r\n\r\nI think scaling is part of data prep prior to HPH but it would be good if provided examples show scaling.\r\n\r\n> 3.

All of our work (and most real world predictive analytics) involves predicting multiple properties from a single set of gathered data (in our case 1000's of things)\r\n\r\nI see; thank you for explaining that. I was unfamiliar with `SKLearn`'s `multioutput` module; however, after taking a look at its contents, I do have a question about how they are generally used.\r\n\r\nI noticed that `MultiOutputClassifier` and `MultiOutputRegressor` require only an `estimator` argument (and optionally `n_jobs`). Adding support for these two seems more straight forward than `ClassifierChain` and `RegressorChain`, which add the kwargs `order`, `cv`, and `random_state`. \r\nSo my questions are, having never used these classes before:\r\n1. Are these kwargs necessary to achieve the full functionality of the classes?\r\n2. How do the latter two classes use the `cv` kwarg? Would it even be necessary since HyperparameterHunter is already fitting the model in a cross validation loop defined by the user? After my (admittedly) very limited exploration, it seems to me that the `cv` kwarg could cause problems/misunderstanding. However, I could be mistaken in assuming it uses `cv` to perform some standard cross-validation fitting loop, so I'd very much appreciate some clarification on it.\r\n3. In HyperparameterHunter, parameters are, for the most part, separated into one of two groups: 1) `Experiment` hyperparameters being tuned, and 2) `Environment`/cross-experiment parameters (like cross-validation parameters and random seeds) which determine when experiments can be fairly compared and learned from during optimization. Given that structure, how would you classify the extra kwargs in the `multioutput` classes (`order`, `cv`, `random_state`, `n_jobs`)? It seems to me that rather than being model initialization parameters, they would fit better with `Environment` parameters.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in explaining to me what you need and for helping make HyperparameterHunter even better! I appreciate you taking the time!\r\n\r\nEdit: Another question, would it be an expectation that using `ClassifierChain` or `RegressorChain` would produce the predictions made by estimators earlier in the chain (in a separate output file, for example), or are these intermediate predictions disposable once final predictions have been made?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/440444486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/440665796","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/96#issuecomment-440665796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/96","id":440665796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDY2NTc5Ng==","user":{"login":"strelzoff-erdc","id":30266091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY2MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30266091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc","html_url":"https://github.com/strelzoff-erdc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strelzoff-erdc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-21T13:42:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T13:42:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\n  I tried `RegressorChain` on the toy problem and it doesn't seem particularly useful.

SEE PR #107 FOR CLOSURE DETAILS\r\n- This PR is being closed in order to break up the implementation of new features across several evolving PRs\r\n- The original content of this PR follows: \r\n> - Intended to add support for using meta-estimators, such as those defined in `sklearn.multioutput`\r\n> - Multi-output tasks already supported for models that offer native support\r\n> - Specifically focused on meta-estimator usage as noted in #96
