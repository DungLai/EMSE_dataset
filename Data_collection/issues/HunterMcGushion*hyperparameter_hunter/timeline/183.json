Yes, you can optimize `class_weight` values! Here's a basic example with SKLearn's `RandomForestClassifier` and the Iris dataset.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import Environment, CVExperiment\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import BayesianOptPro, Integer, Categorical\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter.utils.learning_utils import get_iris_data\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\r\n\r\nenv = Environment(\r\n    train_dataset=get_iris_data(),\r\n    results_path=\"HyperparameterHunterAssets\",\r\n    target_column=\"species\",\r\n    metrics=[\"hamming_loss\"],\r\n    cv_params=dict(n_splits=5, random_state=32),\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Just a reference for normal `class_weight` usage outside of optimization\r\nexp = CVExperiment(\r\n    RandomForestClassifier, {\"n_estimators\": 10, \"class_weight\": {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}}\r\n)\r\n\r\nopt = BayesianOptPro(iterations=10, random_state=32)\r\nopt.forge_experiment(\r\n    model_initializer=RandomForestClassifier,\r\n    model_init_params=dict(\r\n        #################### LOOK DOWN ####################\r\n        class_weight={\r\n            0: Categorical([1, 3]),\r\n            1: Categorical([1, 4]),\r\n            2: Integer(1, 9),  # You can also use `Integer` for low/high ranges\r\n        },\r\n        #################### LOOK UP ####################\r\n        criterion=Categorical([\"gini\", \"entropy\"]),\r\n        n_estimators=Integer(5, 100),\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\nopt.go()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should definitely be included in one of our examples, or at least documented, so thanks for asking again!\r\n\r\n*Side note: I just noticed that the automatic Experiment matching during optimization isn't working for this, which is a bug, so I'll look into that and update you*","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/523722826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2575022747,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU3NTAyMjc0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2575022747","actor":{"login":"alegarbed","id":34462163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDYyMTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34462163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed","html_url":"https://github.com/alegarbed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-22T02:38:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2575022748,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1NzUwMjI3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2575022748","actor":{"login":"alegarbed","id":34462163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDYyMTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34462163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed","html_url":"https://github.com/alegarbed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alegarbed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-22T02:38:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2578460490,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1Nzg0NjA0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2578460490","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"24f176c46e3ee91bb41c5645f6ab9f1b198fff11","commit_url":"https://api.githu
