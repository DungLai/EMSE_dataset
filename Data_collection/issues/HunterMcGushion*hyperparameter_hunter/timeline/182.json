few question regarding functionality/support?\r\n\r\n- Is there support for activation functions not called by name? (lrelu for example?)\r\n- How do we handle multiple layers? I get an error when i try to create a random number of layers\r\n- Is there a good way to select a random number of columns to feature engineer on? Ie. let's say the optimal way to scale my data would be to only scale columns 1 and 10.\r\n-  I also noticed when adding more advanced params to callbacks ie min_delta on reduce_lr, i get an error that real is not compatible with float. Any way around this?\r\n-Last but not least is learn rate, you have to define this inside your optimizer. Is there support for this or a way i can do this?\r\n\r\nThanks, and sorry if some of these have already been answered","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
