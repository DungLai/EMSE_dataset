very sorry for the long delay, but I've been working on updating the testing suite, and I wanted to add the issues you brought up here as test cases. I've just started looking into this again, and wanted to confirm that these are the issues you're having:\r\n1. Embedding layer can’t be given initialized weights - `Embedding` alone works if it initializes own weights - Needs function parameters to be given weight initialization\r\n   - ...\r\n2. Using `eval_set` as `model_extra_params.fit` kwarg\r\n   - `eval_set` is actually an invalid argument for `KerasClassifier`. I think you meant to use `validation_data`\r\n   - However, HyperparameterHunter automatically sets `validation_data` to be OOF data produced by cross validation scheme\r\n      - I can imagine this would be unexpected behavior, so do you have any thoughts on this?\r\n3. Doesn’t work with CuDNN layers (like `CuDNNGRU`)\r\n    - ...\r\n4. Doesn’t work with `kernel_initializer` function values (like `glorot_normal(seed=1230)`, instead of `”glorot_normal”`)\r\n   - Currently HyperparameterHunter expected initializer values to be their string names\r\n   - I overlooked examples like the one you gave with `orthogonal(gain=1.0, seed=10000)`, in which the initializers actually have parameters you may want to change, so I'm looking into this\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I missed any problems you brought up, or if I misunderstood them. Again, I apologize for taking so long to get back to you, but I felt it was important to get unittests working properly before starting to work on the library normally again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/457385197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2095833197,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5NTgzMzE5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2095833197","actor":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:38:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2095833198,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTU4MzMxOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2095833198","actor":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:38:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T23:37:09Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T23:37:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/rep

There are a few more wrinkles to work out, but you should be able to do what you were trying to now with callable initializers. \r\n\r\nRegarding the other problems you brought up, I’m not sure when I’ll be able to tackle them, as there are quite a few other items on my todo list. If you, or anyone else is interested in submitting a PR, I’d be more than happy to work together on it. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I’m going to break up this issue into several separate issues so we can keep better track of them and hopefully make it easier for someone else to track them down.\r\n\r\nI’ll mention you in the new issues, so please feel free to jump in if I miss anything you brought up here. \r\nAs always, thank you for bringing these bugs up and opening the issue! I very much appreciate your help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/461196354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T21:50:16Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T21:50:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/122","id":412140477,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTIxNDA0Nzc=","number":122,"title":"Improve
