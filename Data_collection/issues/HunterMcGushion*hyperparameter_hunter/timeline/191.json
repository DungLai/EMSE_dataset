I don't use the debugger but rather have pycharm setup to \"shift-enter\" through each code blocks and then use the variable inspector to explore.  I think if you were to execute the code in pycharm (not debugger) it will reproduce the error as it is similar to running it in the shell (with the added benefit of having the variable explorer).  \r\n\r\nYes it would be great to have pycharm support to be able to interactively run experiments without having to execute the entire script each time.

I checked that option and restarted the console, which produced a display closer to yours, so as you said, I think that’s unrelated.\r\n\r\nI came up with a smaller snippet for our testing:\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\ndef foo(): ...\r\ninspect.getsource(foo)\r\ninspect.getfile(foo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last line outputs “\\<ipython-input-3-0ad329aeb3e9\\>”, which was interesting, so I looked into my settings and found I had the “Build, Execution, Deployment” > “Console” > “Use IPython if available” option checked. When I unchecked this, I got the `OSError` when running the above snippet. Curiously, only `inspect.getsource` raises the error. `inspect.getfile` returns \"\\<input\\>\" with the above setting unchecked.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like the PyCharm console originally worked for me because of that setting, which must be saving some temporary IPython notebook somewhere, enabling the `inspect` functions to actually function. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can implement something similar in HH. However, the fact that it only worked because of a fairly obscure PyCharm setting makes me think that for HH, we would basically need to save all interactive console input as it’s coming in. To do that, HH would have to be imported immediately after starting the interactive session, and I don’t think that’s a reasonable requirement. I’ll keep trying to think of other ways around this, though…","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/530670843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/530838296","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/191#issuecomment-530838296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/191","id":530838296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDgzODI5Ng==","user":{"login":"jmrichardson","id":6565528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjU1Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6565528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson","html_url":"https://github.com/jmrichardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmrichardson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T13:57:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T13:57:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Great catch!
