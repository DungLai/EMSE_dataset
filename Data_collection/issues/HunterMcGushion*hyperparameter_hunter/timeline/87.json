I mention that in the documentation, but I realize that's a bit confusing since it is a keyword argument. The part of the documentation that might address your problem is **\"If [`root_results_path` is] None or invalid, results will not be stored\"**. \r\nSo it sounds like your problem is that nothing is being saved because no `root_results_path` has been provided. Again, I realize now that this might be confusing, but do you think it would help to make `root_results_path` a required argument? Originally, I made it an optional kwarg for those that really didn't want to save the files.\r\n\r\n2. Yes, that's a problem that I'm looking into solutions for. Currently, it attempts to maximize whatever metric its given (even if its a loss), which is, of course, a problem. I don't know of any way to automate this, so I imagine I'll add an additional kwarg to `Environment`, in which you can specify whether the metric should be maximized or minimized. Do you think that would take care of the problem for you?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your questions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/433564933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":1929992917,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTkyOTk5MjkxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/1929992917","actor":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-26T23:00:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1929992919,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5Mjk5OTI5MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/1929992919","actor":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-26T23:00:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/433614193","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/87#issuecomment-433614193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/87","id":433614193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzYxNDE5Mw==","user":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-27T11:56:12Z","updated_at":"2018-1

and thanks for fast answer & smart package.\r\nwell, It is very clear from the documentation use of 'root_results_path', no problem;\r\ninfact I setted a relative path to store records, and all works

course all of them are saved in 'GlobalLeaderboard.csv';\r\nthen most of the time \"assert experiment.experiment_id in [_[2] for _ in optimizer.similar_experiments]\" raises Expections...(then, where

I’m glad that’s cleared up and the documentation makes sense.\r\n\r\nI see. Are you running the exact, unmodified, most recent `example/functionality_example` script?

I hope to add algorithm-specific leaderboard files that will show hyperparameter values right on the leaderboard, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet.\r\n\r\nEdit: It just occurred to me, that a workaround for your last question might be to start up an optimizer with very broad search boundaries, so as to pickup all the experiments you want to look at. Then, as it reads in the similar experiments, it displays a table of their scores and hyperparameters, which could be exactly what you're looking for. At least until other leaderboard files can be built. Again, if you have any ideas for these I would welcome and very much appreciate any PRs!
