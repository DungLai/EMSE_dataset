The int form is used to specify the column index of the class probabilities you want to use. So if you're doing binary classification and want the probabilities for the \"1\" class, you would use `do_predict_proba`=1.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, [this](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/examples/feature_engineering_examples/olivier_porto_seguro_kaggle.py) is the only example that uses `do_predict_proba` (line 215).\r\n\r\nSorry this was so hard to find.

I could definitely document that better. Thanks for bringing that up. Would it help to add an \"Attributes\" section to the docstring of `experiments.BaseExperiment` in which I list the different dataset attributes?\r\n\r\nIn your case, you probably want your Experiment's `data_test.predictions` attribute. This contains several other attributes for different views of the data at different time divisions. The internals of `data_test` and the other `BaseExperiment.data...` attributes are documented in [the module docstring of `data.data_core`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/hyperparameter_hunter.data.html#module-hyperparameter_hunter.data.data_core). So I'd recommend reading that to better understand what you can access. \r\n\r\nHowever, the easiest way to get the full test predictions at the end of an Experiment would be through the \"HyperparameterHunterAssets\" directory built by your `Environment.results_path`. All of your Experiments' test predictions can be found in csv files inside \"HyperparameterHunterAssets/Experiments/PredictionsTest\" unless you're black-listing them or something.\r\n\r\nAre your Experiments' results not being automatically saved? If you do think that something is misbehaving, would you mind sharing some minimal code so I can reproduce the problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/520187782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2548391723,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NDgzOTE3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2548391723","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-10T23:39:29Z","label":{"name":"Documentation","color":"f27304"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
