I'm afraid I'm not understanding your question. Could you please be a bit more specific, or post some code to illustrate what you want to do?\r\n\r\nRegarding validation predictions, [all of the repo's examples](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/tree/master/examples) show how HH creates validation sets automatically for you via the [`Environment`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_essentials.html#environment) kwargs `cv_type` and `cv_params`. HH also automatically makes predictions for the out-of-fold (OOF) datasets and evaluates those predictions, which you can see during Experiment logging. At the end of the Experiment/OptPro, all results (including OOF/Holdout/Test predictions) are automatically saved in the directory given to `Environment`'s `results_path`, so you can find them there. \r\n\r\nIf you're wondering about Holdout/Test datasets, rather than validation, the [`holdout_test_datasets_example`](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/examples/advanced_examples/holdout_test_datasets_example.py) should be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor saving models, each library has different methods of doing this, but you can make a custom [`lambda_callback`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/hyperparameter_hunter.callbacks.html#hyperparameter_hunter.callbacks.bases.lambda_callback) to save your models. Here's a simple [`lambda_callback_example`](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/examples/advanced_examples/lambda_callback_example.py).\r\n\r\nAs far as using your saved Experiments, their results are all stored in the directory above, so you're free to use them however you would normally use your results: Ensembling, averaging predictions, checking the Leaderboard to compare performance, etc.\r\n\r\nSorry I'm not quite getting your question. Please let me know if I missed anything, and thanks again for asking!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/526788008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2598583599,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1OTg1ODM1OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2598583599","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-31T01:18:12Z","label":{"name":"Question","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/527037666","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/187#issuecomment-527037666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/187","id":527037666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzAzNzY2Ng==","user":{"login":"labarababa","id":45875829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODc1ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45875829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa","html_url":"https://github.com/labarababa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/labarababa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-02T07:36:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T07:36:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> For saving models, each library has different methods of doing this, but you can make a custom lambda_callback to save your models.
