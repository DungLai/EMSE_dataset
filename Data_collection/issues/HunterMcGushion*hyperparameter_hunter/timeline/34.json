temporary workaround for this is to provide a callable to the `metrics_map` argument of `Environment` that returns the negation of the metric you want to use. For example, if your environment looks like this:\r\n```python\r\nenv = Environment(\r\n   ...\r\n   metrics_map=['mean_squared_error'],\r\n   ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\nYour leaderboards will be ordered backwards, and OptimizationProtocols will move in the wrong direction. Instead, for now, use the following:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\r\n\r\nenv = Environment(\r\n   ...\r\n   metrics_map=dict(mean_squared_error=lambda t, p: -mean_squared_error(t, p)),\r\n   ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis has the side effect of including a negative sign before the metric values, but everything works as expected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/434506619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/434652036","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/34#issuecomment-434652036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/34","id":434652036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDY1MjAzNg==","user":{"login":"caprone","id":15055331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15055331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone","html_url":"https://github.com/caprone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caprone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T11:27:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T11:27:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks

    We just finished a nasty but eventually successful 9-month search for a high-dimension, very non-linear, chock full of outliers, real world regression modeling problem.  While we have a breather for a few days we're looking for a smarter way to evaluate and tune parameters for as many approaches as possible while we wait for our next problem to drop. \r\n    We like the approach of HPH and we see support for XGBRegressor and SKLearn-wrapped Keras Regressor but no example of hyper-parameter experiments or optimization with regression rather then classification.  Missing something obvious? Example? Or wrong tool (at least for now)?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1967691149,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5Njc2OTExNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/1967691149","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"19e19ed5d94407ea7aeda5dbd43057e7c8732009","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/commits/19e19ed5d94407ea7aeda5dbd43057e7c8732009","created_at":"2018-11-15T05:04:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1967697660,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk2NzY5NzY2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/1967697660","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"19e19ed5d94407ea7aeda5dbd43057e7c8732009","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/commits/19e19ed5d94407ea7aeda5dbd43057e7c8732009","created_at":"2018-11-15T05:10:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1967697668,"node_id":"MDI2Ok1vdmVkQ29sdW1uc0luUHJvamVjdEV2ZW50MTk2NzY5NzY2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/1967697668","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"moved_columns_in_project","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-15T05:10:11Z","project_card":{"id":12562923,"url":"https://api.github.com/projects/columns/cards/12562923","project_id":1747334,"project_url":"https://api.github.com/projects/1747334","column_name":"Done","previous_column_name":"New Features"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
