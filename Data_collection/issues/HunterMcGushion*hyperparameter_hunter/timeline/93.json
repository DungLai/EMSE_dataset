I apologize; not including any examples was a large oversight, and I'm working on some right now to add. \r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that there is currently an issue with optimizing and sorting leaderboards when using error/loss metrics (#34), but there is also a [simple workaround](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/34#issuecomment-434506619) until #91 is merged into the master branch, which I expect to happen within a couple days. \r\n\r\nSince you mentioned `XGBRegressor` compatibility, here are a couple quick examples demonstrating that it works. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import Environment, CrossValidationExperiment\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import BayesianOptimization, Integer, Real, Categorical\r\nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score\r\n\r\nenv = Environment(\r\n   train_dataset=get_diabetes_data(),\r\n   root_results_path=\"HyperparameterHunterAssets\",\r\n   metrics_map=dict(\r\n      # mean_absolute_error=lambda t, p: -mean_absolute_error(t, p),\r\n      r2_score=lambda t, p: -r2_score(t, p),\r\n   ),\r\n   cross_validation_type=\"KFold\",\r\n   cross_validation_params=dict(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=32),\r\n)\r\n\r\n##################################################\r\n# Experiment\r\n##################################################\r\nexperiment = CrossValidationExperiment(\r\n   model_initializer=XGBRegressor,\r\n   model_init_params=dict(objective=\"reg:linear\", max_depth=4, n_estimators=400, subsample=0.5),\r\n   model_extra_params=dict(fit=dict(eval_metric=\"mae\")),\r\n)\r\n\r\n##################################################\r\n# Hyperparameter Optimization\r\n##################################################\r\noptimizer = BayesianOptimization(iterations=20, read_experiments=True, random_state=32)\r\n\r\noptimizer.set_experiment_guidelines(\r\n   model_initializer=XGBRegressor,\r\n   model_init_params=dict(\r\n      max_depth=Integer(2, 20),\r\n      learning_rate=Real(0.01, 0.7),\r\n      n_estimators=Integer(100, 500),\r\n      subsample=0.5,\r\n      booster=Categorical([\"gbtree\", \"gblinear\"]),\r\n   ),\r\n   model_extra_params=dict(fit=dict(eval_metric=Categorical([\"rmse\", \"mae\"]))),\r\n)\r\n\r\noptimizer.go()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy running all of the above, you can also see one of the most important features of HyperparameterHunter, that is `optimizer` automatically finds the result of `experiment` and learns from it during optimization. Running this example repeatedly will produce a larger pool of past experiments that are automatically learned from each time, dramatically improving the process of hyperparameter optimization over a project's lifespan.\r\n\r\nHere's the data loader I used above to format SKLearn's Diabetes regression dataset. It will be added to HyperparameterHunter along with the regression examples shortly.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\r\n\r\ndef get_diabetes_data():\r\n   data = load_diabetes()\r\n   df = pd.DataFrame(data=data.data, columns=[_.replace(\" \", \"_\") for _ in data.feature_names])\r\n   df[\"target\"] = data.target\r\n   return df\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note in the above examples, I made no attempt at selecting effective hyperparameters. They are just used for the example, so they may perform poorly. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps answer your question. If you have any other questions, please let me know!
