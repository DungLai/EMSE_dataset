Let me start by saying that your questions are definitely not “stupid”! These are fantastic questions, and I’m sure many others have them as well. So thank you for bringing them to my attention, because it means that I probably need to improve the documentation. \r\n\r\nRegarding `RandomForestOptPro` and `GradientBoostedRegressionTreeOptPro`, you may already be clear on this, but it helps me to remember that they’re just normal ML algorithms. Hyperparameter optimization is just ML on top of ML. These two algorithms (I call them “OptPros” or “Optimization Protocols” because they’re designed for hyperparameter optimization) are built on top of SKLearn’s [`RandomForestRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) and [`GradientBoostingRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html), respectively. Since you’re familiar with Bayesian optimization, it could help to remember that our `BayesianOptPro` is similarly built on top of SKLearn’s [`GaussianProcessRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html). \r\n\r\nEach of the Optimization Protocols is just a wrapper around some existing ML algorithm to enable us to use it for hyperparameter optimization. So in order to understand the two OptPros you mentioned, I would recommend reading the documentation for the above-mentioned SKLearn classes that they use internally: [`RandomForestRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) and [`GradientBoostingRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html). Of course, these classes are the `base_estimator`s for each OptPro, and we also make use of things like acquisition functions in order to estimate the utility of each proposed set of hyperparameters, but this is also the case in standard Bayesian optimization. \r\n\r\nIn the end, the most significant difference between the `BayesianOptPro` with which you’re familiar and `RandomForestOptPro`, for example, is that `BayesianOptPro` uses `GaussianProcessRegressor` as its `base_estimator`, whereas `RandomForestOptPro` uses `RandomForestRegressor`. \r\n\r\nI know my response hasn’t really touched on the technical differences between the different OptPros, but like I said, to get a better idea of the specific differences in behaviors, you can see the documentation of the `base_estimator` classes. For HH, it makes sense to offer a wider range of OptPros because it’s so easy to switch between them due to the fact that HH automatically records and reuses Experiments during Optimization. Sometimes you may find that `BayesianOptPro` simply isn’t working as well as you want. With HH, you can simply stop your current OptPro and pick up learning with a different OptPro to see how things go—without losing everything your previous OptPro learned. In my problems, I find it often helps to get the different perspective of another OptPro. In fact, I’ll often switch between all of them, giving each 10 iterations, then moving on to the next OptPro. I don’t know of any other library that enables this sort of diverse exploration of the problem space while still retaining all of the data collected by previous optimization rounds. \r\n\r\n**Turning to your question about finding the best Experiment**, you are correct that the key is using the leaderboard file. This could definitely be better documented, so I apologize. What you’ll want to do is check the Leaderboard for the `experiment_id` corresponding to the score you want. Then go to the “Experiments/Descriptions” directory. Each of the JSON files here are named after an `experiment_id` in the Leaderboard. So open up the JSON file for the Experiment you want, and you’ll find all of the important information about the Experiment, including scores, execution times, algorithm used, and of course, hyperparameters and feature engineering steps used. Under the “hyperparameters” key you can find all the hyperparameters used for the Experiment—even the ones you didn’t explicitly declare—so you can thoroughly recreate the Experiment. \r\n\r\nBoth of these topics could definitely be documented better, so thank you very much for asking these fantastic questions! Please let me know if you have any further questions or feedback, and thank you for your support! I really appreciate it!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/532026567/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"id":2638309237,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYzODMwOTIzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2638309237","actor":{"login":"chwang1991","id":39996696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTk2Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39996696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991","html_url":"https://github.com/chwang1991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T02:04:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2638309239,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MzgzMDkyMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2638309239","actor":{"login":"chwang1991","id":39996696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTk2Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39996696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991","html_url":"https://github.com/chwang1991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chwang1991/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T02:04:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2638309455,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2MzgzMDk0NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/events/2638309455","actor":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-17T02:04:09Z"
