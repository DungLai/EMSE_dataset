In addition, if an `id_column` is specified for `Environment`, it is removed prior to training. \r\nApart from those two, the actual way to specify which columns are used to `fit` the Experiment, is via the `feature_selector` kwarg to the `CrossValidationExperiment` class. If `feature_selector` is not specified, all columns aside from `target_column`, and `id_column` in `train_dataset` will be used during training/predicting. All columns are used regardless of type.\r\n\r\n- Currently, the file path is expected to be a .csv file, and as the documentation notes, it will be opened via `pandas.read_csv`, so anything accepted by `pandas.read_csv` is fine.\r\n\r\n- No, at the moment, we can only provide DataFrames. I’d like to expand this to include other dataset types, including Pools and standard NumPy arrays. Unfortunately, I don’t have much experience with Pools, so I’d need some help adding that functionality, but I’ve been able to use CatBoost without issues in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing all this to my attention! I’ll update the documentation shortly!
