The TL;DR version of my findings is that I don’t think HH can support time-series CV right now. Here’s the long version:\r\n\r\nI was able to throw together a quick/dirty subclass of `PurgedWalkForwardCV` that got past the error you posted. I’ll include the code for it below, along your snippet, slightly modified to use the new subclass. Anyways, it got past the TypeError and successfully made predictions and evaluations for folds, until it started expecting data for all `n_splits` when there was none. As I mentioned, I’m no expert on time-series forecasting, so I just realized that OOF predictions won’t actually be generated for all of the training data because of how time-series CV schemes work. In the end, the Experiment tried to keep going past the third fold, on to a fourth and fifth because `n_splits=5`; however, there are actually only 3 splits (as your second snippet shows). \r\n\r\nSo I don’t think we can get this working properly just by using some combination of custom `cv_type` classes and `lambda_callback`s. I believe a new Experiment class would need to be added to specifically deal with time-series data. Because the Experiment class is built out of very modular callback classes that it dynamically inherits at instantiation, I think we could get by with just some new `predictors`/`evaluators` callbacks that are updated to make predictions and evaluations for the appropriate number of splits for a time-series problem. If you’re interested in contributing, I’d love to work together to add support for this. At the moment, I’m still not familiar enough with time-series problems to be able to get the job done myself. Either way, I’d love to see this added soon! \r\n\r\nMy quick and dirty `PurgedWalkForwardCV` subclass code follows, along with the output.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import Environment, CVExperiment\r\nfrom timeseriescv.cross_validation import PurgedWalkForwardCV\r\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nclass UglyPurgedWalkForwardCV(PurgedWalkForwardCV):\r\n    def __init__(self, pred_times=None, eval_times=None, split_by_time=False, **kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\"Override initialization to receive the three extra kwargs expected by \r\n        :meth:`split`.
