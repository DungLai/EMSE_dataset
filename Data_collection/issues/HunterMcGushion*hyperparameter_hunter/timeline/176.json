More answers to come...\r\n\r\nHi, thanks for the response.\r\n\r\nIn regards to your comment on learn rate and custom activation functions, now that i am thinking about it a way that i've gotten by similar limitations in my own custom hyper parameter optimizer is to use a wrapper functions, where the appropriate layer is returned by string key. So for example\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef actv_custom_wrapper_func(activation):\r\n    if activation == 'lrelu':\r\n        return LeakyReLU()\r\n    if activation == 'relu':\r\n        return Activation('relu')\r\n```\r\n\r\n`model.add(actv_custom_wrapper_func(Categorical(['relu', 'lrelu'])))`\r\n\r\nAnd i think this should solve my issue. I think i could use a similar method to get variable optimizer and learn rate. I would just need my wrapper function to take two arguments.\r\n\r\n`model.add(opt_custom_wrapper_func(Categorical(['adam', 'nadam', 'adamax']), Real(0.1, 0.0001)))`\r\n\r\nI can test this out and see if it works but before i do, is there a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nAs for the layers question, if i do something like the following\r\n```\r\nfor x in range(Integer(1, 5)):\r\n    # add layer ie.\r\n    model.add(Dense(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get an error which i assume to be caused by an inconsistent number of parameters on different runs which is understandable. Is there a way to have the # of layers as a variable? Or is it incompatible with this type of parameter optimization.\r\n\r\nFor the error about params on callbacks, i think any time you use a float for a callback param you get an error. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nmodel_extra_params=dict(\r\n    callbacks=[ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='loss', patience=Integer(5, 25), **min_delta=Real(0.01, 0.0001)**, verbose=0)]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nI believe that inside the ReduceLROnPlateau callback function there is comparison operators for min_delta like greater than that causes an error when it tries to compare a Real object to a float.\r\n\r\nLastly, to your follow up on question 3, yes, i am trying to find out if there is a good way to select a random number of columns to scale. For example, if there were a selection entity, ie. Selection(0, 1000, 30) which would select 30 random columns in the range of 0 to 1000. I'm sure sure if this is feasible given how your program works but i think it would be an important feature to have.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/519534502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ben-arnao","id":8053809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTM4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8053809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-arnao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-arnao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/comments/519801286","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/176#issuecomment-519801286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/176","id":519801286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTgwMTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T06:48:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T06:49:06Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I’m sorry, but I’m having some trouble tracking which of your five questions we’re talking about haha.
