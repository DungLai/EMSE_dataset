If you haven't seen it, would you mind checking that out and letting me know if that's at all what you're talking about?\r\n\r\nMy other thought is that you might be looking for the `feature_selector` kwarg of [`CVExperiment`](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_essentials.html#experimentation). Both `feature_engineer` and `feature_selector` are also kwargs in the [`forge_experiment` method of all the OptPros](https://hyperparameter-hunter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_essentials.html#experimentation) for optimization, which is when you would be using `Integer` to define a search space.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm completely missing your point.
