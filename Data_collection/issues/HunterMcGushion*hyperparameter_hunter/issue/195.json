Reading enough, I figured out the basics, and I'm sure the entire API is well-figurable - but the idea is, the \"hunting\" aspect of HH isn't as 'emphasized' or promptly explained. The two questions I found answers the _last_ to are ones I sought out from the _beginning_:\r\n\r\n- How to specify _which_ hyperparameters to optimize?\r\n- How to specify the _search range_?\r\n\r\nE.g., the [Keras example](https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/blob/master/examples/keras_examples/optimization_example.py) imports `Real` - but there's no way to tell what \"Real\" does without reading the docs; a more intuitive name would be `RealSearchRange`, or `from search_range import Real` - else I figure it's a form of type casting. -- I intend on learning the API further, but currently my question is: I use my own training loop class, which takes care of the following:\r\n - _Training_, via `train_on_batch` \r\n - _Validation_, via `predict` (using outputs to programmatically compute F1-score, loss, etc)\r\n - _Data pipeline_ - all data preprocessed, and shuffled at each epoch\r\n- _Checkpointing/logging_ - best model per F1-score, logging history, etc\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set up HH to _only_ do hyperparameter search? I don't mind its other functionalities, so long as they don't conflict with those of my own","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
