Is there any paper can explain it or should I check somewhere in your documentation (I tried but failed :3 )\r\n\r\nand a might-be stupid question: how to extract the best estimator from the experiment? So far I guess the only way is to check the leaderboad then get the best estimator's key then check the json file? Could it be more straightforward?\r\n\r\nBTW thanks for developing such a GREAT tool!
