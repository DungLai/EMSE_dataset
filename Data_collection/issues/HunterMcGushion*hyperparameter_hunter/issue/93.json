While we have a breather for a few days we're looking for a smarter way to evaluate and tune parameters for as many approaches as possible while we wait for our next problem to drop. \r\n    We like the approach of HPH and we see support for XGBRegressor and SKLearn-wrapped Keras Regressor but no example of hyper-parameter experiments or optimization with regression rather then classification.  Missing something obvious? Example? Or wrong tool (at least for now)?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
