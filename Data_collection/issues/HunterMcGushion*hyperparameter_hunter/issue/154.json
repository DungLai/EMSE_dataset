Use `BayesianOptPro`\r\n2. Use exclusively `Categorical` dimensions\r\n3. (*Kinda optional - See details below*) At least one of the `Categorical` dimensions must be in `FeatureEngineer`\r\n\r\nThe above 3 conditions will cause `BayesianOptPro` to break outright. However, problems still arise when omitting `FeatureEngineer`, while searching an exclusively multi-`Categorical` space. The effect of this bug is that saved experiment results are not properly marked as `similar_experiments`. Tests demonstrating the behavior of this second bug are added in 4b60f1a. Tests for both variants of the bug are added in #152.\r\n\r\nWhen the two xfail tests are marked as xpass, the bug is probably (hopefully) fixed.\r\n\r\n## Code to reproduce error:\r\n```python\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import Environment, BayesianOptPro, FeatureEngineer\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter import Categorical, Integer\r\nfrom hyperparameter_hunter.utils.learning_utils import get_boston_data\r\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor\r\n\r\ndef nothing_transform(train_targets, non_train_targets):\r\n   return train_targets, non_train_targets, lambda _: _\r\n\r\nenv = Environment(\r\n   train_dataset=get_boston_data(),\r\n   results_path=\"HHAssets\",\r\n   target_column=\"DIS\",\r\n   metrics=[\"median_absolute_error\"],\r\n   cv_params=dict(n_splits=3, random_state=1),\r\n)\r\n\r\nopt_1 = BayesianOptPro(iterations=5, random_state=32, n_initial_points=1)\r\nopt_1.set_experiment_guidelines(\r\n   model_initializer=AdaBoostRegressor,\r\n   model_init_params=dict(),                                 # FLAG: This breaks\r\n   # model_init_params=dict(n_estimators=Integer(10, 100)),  # FLAG: This works\r\n   feature_engineer=FeatureEngineer([\r\n      Categorical([nothing_transform], optional=True),\r\n   ]),\r\n)\r\nopt_1.go()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- All other optimization protocols are fine with exclusively `Categorical` search spaces\r\n- Switching the two `model_init_params` in the code above demonstrates that the problem is bypassed by adding a non-`Categorical` dimension","closed_by":{"login":"HunterMcGushion","id":11300915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11300915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion","html_url":"https://github.com/HunterMcGushion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HunterMcGushion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
