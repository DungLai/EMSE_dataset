I've found a performance issue in dataset_input.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size)`[(line 109)](https://github.com/junqiangchen/LiTS---Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-Challenge/blob/b547eb42cab6e09a1a4bd86ad428c9e7d8a31cf8/LiTS/data_input/dataset_input.py#L109) should be called before `dataset.map(_parse_function)`[(line 107)](https://github.com/junqiangchen/LiTS---Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-Challenge/blob/b547eb42cab6e09a1a4bd86ad428c9e7d8a31cf8/LiTS/data_input/dataset_input.py#L107) and `dataset.map(_preprocess_function)`[(line 108)](https://github.com/junqiangchen/LiTS---Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-Challenge/blob/b547eb42cab6e09a1a4bd86ad428c9e7d8a31cf8/LiTS/data_input/dataset_input.py#L108), which could make your program more efficient.\r\n\r\nHere is [the tensorflow document](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/data_performance?hl=zh_cn#vectorized_mapping) to support it.\r\n\r\nBesides, you need to check the function `_preprocess_function` called in `dataset.map(_preprocess_function)` whether to be affected or not to make the changed code work properly. For example, if `_preprocess_function` needs data with shape (x, y, z) as its input before fix, it would require data with shape (batch_size, x, y, z) after fix.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply. Btw, I am very glad to create a PR to fix it if you are too busy.","closed_by":{"login":"junqiangchen","id":28638716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjM4NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28638716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/junqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junqiangchen/LiTS---Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-Challenge/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junqiangchen/LiTS---Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-Challenge/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
