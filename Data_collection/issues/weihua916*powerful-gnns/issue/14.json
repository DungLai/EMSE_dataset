I use the DGL implementation of GIN for node classification but I can't produce accuracy near to GCN.\r\nIS there a need for some preprocessing when applying GIN on node classification?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weihua916/powerful-gnns/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
